4,"Look, just don't say anything to Maven, will you? I've spent weeks trying to get that right and if she sees how stupid I am, she'll get rid of me."
5,I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
11,For me? From whom?
16,"Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild."
18,"We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called ""The Dreamstride."""
21,Only those whose Voice is strong can find the path. Come. We will teach you a Shout to open the way to Paarthurnax.
23,Captain Lonely-Gale! I've been looking for you everywhere!
24, 
25,I find these parties such a dreadful bore.
26,"I don't think he would have wanted your absolution, Rorlund. He worshiped Talos."
29,"Make your choice, Dragonborn. You're either with us or against us."
30,"Me? I like to talk to my targets before the kill. Taunt them, scare them... even challenge them."
33,Where've you been all day?
34,I... I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one of your colleagues must know his location.
40,Don't talk to me. You could be one of them.
42,Hiding? The shadows are my domain!
44,What makes you think I know anything? Everyone knows he's dead and gone!
47,"Please, tell me you have good news."
48,They're half-naked. That ain't right. Somebody's gotta say somethin'...
51,"Steady, legionnaires! We've been through worse. Just keep your guard up!"
54,"Name's Rune. Yeah, rune... just like you're thinking."
55,Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
57,That sounds lovely. You're very sweet.
58,"I beg you, don't go into Silus's museum. "
59,So this is where Delphine has been hiding all these years? Hmm.
60,Once I'm in charge I have bigger aspirations than just Skyrim. I plan to bring Black-Briar Mead to all of Tamriel.
63,"Splendid! With the extra coin, I'll be able to purchase twice the volume in supplies that I normally do."
64,Go on ahead. I'll stand guard.
66,"That's quite an opening demand, Tullius."
67,"Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines!"
70,"So, any luck finding my louse of a husband?"
74,"There is much to do, and I need every able bodied man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim."
75,What have you done to me?
76,Hmm. I can't say I've any idea what they were up to. Have you found this observatory?
77,Has he? I suppose he doesn't want to miss a chance to bluster about the Empire's many crimes.
80,Hrm.
83,These Reach folk are so... nosy.
85,"With Mercer Frey gone and our influence present in all of Skyrim's cities, the Guild's accumulating wealth faster than we can spend it."
86,Then we got nothin' more to talk about.
88,Finally. Now I can get back to work.
93,"Well, let's all raise a flagon to Ulfric; future King of Skyrim and bringer of poverty to the working class!"
97,Ha! Wonderful!
99,"If you change your mind, seek me out here."
102,"Don't have nothing to say to you, stranger."
105,I wonder if there's any more Imperials hiding down here somewhere.
106,"Once we have the Lexicon, we'll need to take it to its podium. I know what to do from there. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be mine."
107,Ah! You've retrieved the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller.
109,"I know it's what everyone says, ""To go to new places and see the world."" But it's true in my case... I never bargained on seeing more than I liked."
110,The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage.
114,"Oh, well... You seem to already have assistance. Surely you mean to remain inconspicuous..."
116,"Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's happy. Just get over here, mutt."
117,The Temple of Divines is always open for worshipers.
118,Warrens ain't for you. Trust me.
121,"There he devours the souls of the heroic dead to feed his power. You must find his portal to Sovngarde before he returns, stronger than ever."
124,There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.
128,Zah!
130,Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.
131,"Oh, I think you dropped this. Some kind of note. Looks important."
134,This woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
136,Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been closed.
138,"They were said to be quite fond of ritual sacrifices. So fond, in fact, that the high priest spent a great deal of time sharpening the dagger."
139,Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller.
145,I've waited an eternity for this day.
147,Out of my sight! 
148,"I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe."
151,"Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure me that we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details."
152,"The beds and beer are both lousy, you ask me."
154,May the road favor the foolish...
157,War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that. 
158,"You might be able to trap him there, exactly."
161,"100 gold will secure my release. You can afford that, can't you?"
164,What's this nonsense I've been hearing? How dare you call Bolli a deadbeat!
166,Urag can be very helpful. Just don't antagonize him.
168,He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.
172,"Enough posturing, Tullius. If you came to talk, let's get on with it."
173,Oh? I hadn't noticed.
174,Your objective is Fort Greymoor.
176,"My daughter's driving me crazy, so forgive me if I'm a bit on edge."
179,How rude! Can't be bothered to host an old friend for a decade or two.
181,The people of Skyrim have no appreciation for what we do here. Not that I care.
184,Ready to do this?
185,"Come on, show an old man what you got!"
190,"But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating."
200,"Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us."
202,Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with my daughter's death.
203,"I was a barmaid at the Winking Skeever when I met my husband, rest his soul. Wasn't for him, I'd still be working there!"
204,Walk always in the shadow of Sithis.
207,"I know, I was late. I'm sorry."
208,The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.
211,"Persistent aren't you? Oh, very well. Who am I to stand in the way of curiosity?"
212,My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
213,You're wrong! Sibbi and I are in love and you're just jealous!
214,I'm not sticking around to fight a dragon!
215,"There was a fight down in the Ratway, but reports are... sketchy. Some say it was Thalmor Agents, others say Thieves Guild. Some say it was both."
218,"I think I heard someone mention it was underneath the Temple of Dibella, in the big crag in the center of the city."
220,"Begging your pardon milady... I know these have something to do with Dibella, but whatever are they for?"
222,Why do you even need to ask? They treat your people as bad as they do mine.
223,"The Empire will withdraw its troops from Winterhold, allowing Jarl Korir to return from exile."
227,That's a fine potion you've put together.
230,I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.
231,You do indeed have the power. I'm impressed.
233,Exactly! And now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it?
238,Help! Someone's being attacked!
239,"So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh?"
240,He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.
243,You know. Where do you get your goods? I am always amazed at how you manage to sell things so cheaply.
244,"But why? Why, pray tell, have I received word that Anton Virane is still walking around Markarth, hale and healthy as the day he was born?"
247,"Good, good. It's honest work, son. No shame in that."
248,"I just finished giving my old war companion, Berit, a proper burial by fire. Old hard head hated the idea of being lost cold in the ground."
249,Do some people look down on me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right.
251,"Walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!"
252,Maybe you just aren't up to the challenge...
253,You may go now...
254,"I'll round up what men I can, and meet you outside Northwatch Keep. We'll get in and out as fast as possible."
256,We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered.
259,It's not hard to fit in and make friends when you have the coin to make it happen.
260,An Orc follows to the death.
262,"You can offer, but I may not buy."
263,"Hm? Sorry, just thinking about my experiments."
264,"Talen my friend, up for some fishing this week?"
265,"The sound of our fury is a storm about to break on the heads of our enemies. Our friendship, a cloak of true brotherhood for all who would wear it."
266,The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us... leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.
269,"If you want to make the most of your investment, you'll come here to sell your goods."
273,A trick of the dark perhaps?
275,You monster!  I'll kill you for this!
280,Are you kidding me? I fought off all those bandits. I'm not afraid of you.
281,More than you'll ever realize. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.
283,"The Dark Brotherhood is on the rise again, Listener. I can feel it."
284,"Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Whiterun, but a nice enough place if you like swamps."
285,"Is that confidence, or bravado? Confidence I can use. Bravado gets soldiers killed. "
286,Thanks!
290,Looking for the blade? You aren't the first!
292,"My Jarl, we need to discuss the state of Markarth's collapsing trade with the other holds."
295,You found it? I've been looking for that blade for months. You took on all those bandits yourself?
301,You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother.
303,Now let us turn our conversation away from such unpleasantness.
304,"They call themselves the ""Blood Horkers."" "
305,"Go now, with haste. Take my beacon to Mount Kilkreath."
308,"Now, as for your wish... An end to the war, was it?"
309,Hands off. That's my armor now!
311,Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his pocket?
312,"I suppose so. But believe me. Only us servants have a key like that, and its a very expensive looking lock. Really, I wouldn't worry about it."
318,Yeargh!
319,Do you think they will sit idle while a dragon is slaughtering my men and burning my city?
321,"I'm a married man! Hey, where should we live? I guess you could always stay with me."
325,I think not.
326,Are the gods angry with me? 
327,"My father is Alvor, the blacksmith. I'm his assistant. I mean, apprentice."
336,"We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever troops he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt."
339,Live for thousands of years!
340,"Who's there? Is that you, father?"
344,Aren't they slow? I can get in and out before you have one swing.
345,"Ah, you're back. I hope you've made some progress on tracking down this Shout we need to defeat Alduin?"
346,Slow's the only way to do it! Work too hard and you'll warp the wood.
350,"Come on, just open."
351,Here's your payment.
353,"Well then ""observe"" from a greater distance. You're making people uncomfortable."
354,"Yes, I recognize it."
358,"Giants don't usually cause problems like this, but these ones are stirred up for some reason."
359,Can you get it open?
360,I certainly do.
362,Want to talk? Go ahead.
363,"No, not that it's any of your business."
364,A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries.
366,I've checked with my court and apparently you're fully eligible... there's nothing standing in the way of presenting you the title.
375,"Aye, that it has. Trust me, mum - once you've killed a man from a horse, you'll never want to fight on the ground again. Ain't no goin' back."
376,I've got your back.
381,"Just say the word, mistress."
384,Piss off. I'm busy.
385,"Could you have brought us more wondrous news? Recent events notwithstanding, this is a happy day for us, my friend."
386,"To tell you the truth, Sabjorn isn't much of an owner. Slave driver, sure."
387,Everybody ready? We charge on my signal.
388,"I can't believe this is happening, lad."
389,Perhaps it's because there's no better way to face the cold Skyrim nights than with a belly full of ale?
390,Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.
391,I really got myself into it this time.
394,A group of them has holed up in Eastmarch.
395,"But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough."
400,"With Nurelion gone, I suppose Quintus has taken over business in the White Phial."
403,Dirge! Did you take out the trash like I asked?
405,"Though... Perhaps there's another option. I, umm, I may require further assistance from you."
407,May all your possible futures be bright.
408,"And finally, Sibbi; the worst of all of them. He's in Riften Jail for murder."
411,Think you can steal from me?
413,I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.
416,It's alright Karliah. You don't have to say a word.
417,"It was a pleasure, thank you."
418,"I have a single one left, quite expensive, but also quite elegant."
421,Find me if you're ever lookin' for some extra coin.
422,Hod! Come here a minute. I need your help with something.
425,What? Filthy assassin! We'll see who lies dead!
428,"Old fort. Abandoned for years. They're like jackals, making their home anywhere they can find."
429,"How about the fact that our farm was attacked by bandits, and that they killed my entire family who didn't even brandish a weapon against them."
430,"If I tell you, you need to promise not to kill me."
432,"I have a buyer with, shall we say, a very odd taste in literature looking for some particular books."
434,"I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back."
435,Nope. Not even close.
436,Not now.
437,"When you told me of your intent to join the Thieves Guild, I honestly didn't think we'd have much to speak about ever again."
438,City of Markarth sure is a beauty. No doubt about that.
440,"I wish I could, milady. Sadly, I haven't sold enough of my own jewelry let alone buy some from you. I'm sorry."
441,Is there... something I can do for you?
443,"Uncivilized, pelt-wearing axe-draggers. It's a wonder they don't still live in a cave like those ancestors they keep boasting about."
448,"Mmmm, careful with that, Nenya, our merchants could be selling weapons to an invading force."
449,"Those who fought the Thalmor in the Great War still see an enemy. But that war is over, and a new day has dawned."
455,This was such a glorious city. But then everything had to change. The Empire came... and my brother was lost...
456,We want compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
457,Wonder if any of my ancestors ever walked these halls?
458, 
461,Everyone's been worried since you and Mercer haven't shown up in a while. Brynjolf even went out to find you.
463,"Oh, it's you! Sorry to hear about your imprisonment. I'm sure the guards didn't mean to throw you in jail"
464,"Oh, I have the utmost faith in your success, believe me. So let's begin."
468,Will I need to talk so loudly with my wife when I get married?
470,"Here's to friendship. A gift! If you don't like it, too bad."
471,"Today, she's... well, she's a skeleton. An ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought to this Sanctuary by her Keeper."
479,Not now.
480,This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you.
482,No. We're completely exposed. Bows and arrows are in short supply. Every building is made of thatch and wood.
483,The mine's always on the verge of collapse. Good thing I'm around to keep it up.
488,Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful.
489,Soldiers! They're everywhere these days. And not a one of them knows how to pick up after themselves.
490,Chop chop!
493,"Die, dragon!"
494,"Vision? What vision are you talking about? Oh, no matter."
496,"No, the dragons are merely the final portent of the End of Days."
500,You what? Oh. That. Good. I hope there was a lot of blood.
504,And there are accounts of your suspicious behavior throughout the city. Now come quietly.
505,"Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?"
506,"That's the part that Ulfric's supporters always conveniently forget about. Unless the Empire stands together, the Thalmor will destroy us all."
508,The Arch-Mage is dead! Dead!
516,This looks promising.
518,That museum is a mistake.
519,"Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed."
521,"Windhelm. White as bone, and cold as the Void."
524,"If that weapon causes problems for my customers, I cause problems for you. Got it?"
525,Now we'll see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.
529,"I hold you responsible for this situation. So, you better win me back Riften, or die trying."
530,"Whoever this is, clearly we got off on the wrong foot. Ah, but no worries. This is not the first time I have been bagged and dragged."
535,There's plenty more where that came from. Just give a holler.
536,This is insanity. We never should've come here.
538,"I handle the fishin', numbers and bedlam jobs... the ones with the more personal touch."
541,Thank you. It would mean a lot to me.
542,True Nords never back down!
543,"Thorald did worse. He took action against the Empire, and the Battle-Borns knew it."
545,"That's fine. I have a special occasion coming up, and I'd like to have it."
551,"Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College, but he has a room here."
553,"Well, nothing. At least not any more. Folk just call me that because of what I used to do."
554,"I think the Bards College might be looking for recruits. You should speak to the head of the college, Viarmo, if you're interested."
555,We sold all those lovely little necklaces you brought me today. Did you make them yourself?
563,"Do not worry, my friend. All is well."
564,Arkay helps us find peace with death.
566,Then the hunger set in. Curiosity. What's the harm in just one bite?
567,Mighty impressive.
569,This had better be the last I hear of you disrespecting my family.
572,"But, as you say, these negotiations may offer a chance for his supporters to gracefully return to the Imperial fold."
573,Take care.
578,"It is especially potent against the undead, and should burn them to a crisp in no time."
580,"We were excavating this old tomb when we opened a chamber full of corpses. The team took one look, turned tail, and ran."
594,"Calixto, someone left an interesting ring in here a few weeks ago. Would you like a look?"
595,"Behold, the future. Behold, the Thalmor!"
597,Bersi still refuses to cooperate. What did you want to do?
599,I can't imagine how exciting it must be like to journey from place to place. You're so lucky!
600,"I'd simply snap my fingers, and everyone in Skyrim would die. War resolved."
602,Stand back. Interrupting an execution is a serious crime.
604,"Off the coast a ways to the east, you'll find the wreck of the Brinehammer. Never know what treasures may still be aboard."
608,The research I've done seems to indicate that Skorm Snow-Strider left part of his journal here after laying siege.
615,"Vex and Delvin are having to turn clients away at this point, it's almost impossible to keep up."
618,What? A dragon? In Helgen?
619,May the Eight guide you to the Phial...
622,Safe travels.
626,The young folks are too happy to break their backs for the Nords. They forget what it was like to swim free.
628,"If you find that sword, please bring it to me."
632, 
637,Call upon me if I can be of any service.
639,"Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time."
640,We know what path you've set her on. But she has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
644,"Here, see for yourself. This is the last word I received. I'm telling you, he's gone for good."
645,"He is weak. And no doubt knows it. He's no fool, he'll come, if only to give his troops a chance to refit."
646,They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!
651,"If I ever catch my husband in bed with another woman, he's going to find himself homeless."
652,"Hello, husband. You slept well?"
653,"What can I get for you, ma'am?"
655,I was kidnapped by these bandits weeks ago. They locked me up in the towers near Mistwatch.
657,Perfect. Hopefully this will let us know more about their movement. I think we've got them on the run!
658,Perhaps. But not today.
659,What would Hroggar say if he heard I was drinking with you?
660,"Eh, not so bad."
661,Can you spare any coin?
666,"If we'd all died there, if we'd loosed the thing on the world, who knows what might have happened?"
668,Heard about you and your honeyed words...
669,"Not now, I'm trying to watch this!"
670,And they always come to regret it.
672,"Come out and face me, you coward!"
676,"Aye, that he was. And you sniffed him out because he broke one of the cardinal rules of our business... he got greedy."
677,I can do that! I did it yesterday!
683,"Go. Tell your commanders you have won. I, my family, and my men will be gone before they arrive."
684,The Thalmor take the arrogance of high elves to the extreme - they believe they are the rightful rulers of all of Tamriel.
685,You look suspicious. You better not be one of those damn thieves.
686,Sometimes I wonder if the gods have abandoned us... as we have abandoned them.
689,"The parchment you recovered mentions a ""Gajul-Lei."" According to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts."
692,Oh? Where?
693,"I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this, so I simply won't."
694,"As soon as we can muster our forces, we'll be back."
695,"You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in The Hag's Cure, when the shop is open."
696,My title is just a formality. I've always been in charge around here.
697,"But I am cursed, it would seem, to live alone."
699,That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact.
702,"Never mind that. Madena is a good woman, but I have my own reasons for opening this museum, and I'm not changing my mind."
704,You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a staff?
706,My brother died. Things won't be the same without him.
709,The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.
710,"Careful. You spill one drop of silver, I'm taking it out of your hide."
712,"That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No?"
713,"When I married Torygg, he promised we'd go to lavish parties just like this. I wish he were here now."
715,"I've finally tracked down the last of the Totems, I think."
716,I would suggest staying on the plates with the Dragonborn symbol.
719,It's been easier lately.
731,"You withdraw from Falkreath, and allow Siddgeir to resume his rightful place as Jarl."
732,I'm too busy tending to the dead to spend my time making more of them.
737,You're someone who can get things done. I like that.
738,Not when there's so much to see!
743,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
745,A Light that could illuminate Skyrim and her people.
749,"I'll talk with Jala, dear. I'm sure she'll accept a potato as repayment."
752,We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?
756,This can't be happening.
758,"Wujeeta, you really need to stop using that skooma. It's very bad for your health and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to you."
759,What was that?
763,You should talk to Ainethach. He runs the mines. Used to anyway.
765,Come back here!
767,Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim.
768,This looks like the area Agna told me about. She said that the bear would show the way...
769,I suppose you're right. I'm not a fighting man.
770,In the mountains to the northeast. I'll mark it on your map.
773,Thank you for your kindness.
775,Spiced wine for ya? It's a family recipe.
785,One of the ingredients I need to cultivate nirnroot are jazbay grapes... the acidic content of the juice is perfect for the soil.
788,"We've taken to calling her Queen Alfsigr, or just Allie for short. I expect you can name her anything you like once she's yours."
795,Stay close and in plain view. No funny business unless you want a few inches of steel in your belly.
797,"Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!"
799,We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
800,The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!
801,"Something you need, you miserable wretch?"
802,I think I can teach you a thing or two.
803,"This is exciting, isn't it?"
810,The execution will proceed as planned.
811,"Things are bad, Igmund. Our forces are barely able to keep the Forsworn in check. Merchants are reporting the loss of more of their shipments."
816,Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean up the mess.
820,"If you wish to hunt with me, your feet need to be quick, and your eyes quicker."
821,"Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people."
822,How do you think? He's a pig. All I am to him is a warm body to lay with.
823,"By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept."
825,"Hmph. Yes. Yes, I believe you are. Very well, then."
828,As do I. It's a puzzling situation.
830,"You there! Serving girl! What's your name, dear?"
835,"Cicero admits, he thought the Listener would be dead by now. Heh. Maybe we could just forget all this? Hmm? Let bygones be bygones? What do you say?"
843,Stick close. This place gives me the creeps.
847,"Oh, okay. I didn't think you'd help me. Nobody ever does."
848,"Thank you, dear. It must be nice to get out of the hall every now and then."
854,I thought it was crystal clear... no one dies on these jobs. Remember that next time you want to get paid.
855,I want to hear about this dragon.
857,I'm gonna go play soldier with a tree!
858,Hey! Wanna play tag?
861,Pack your things and go.
868,"Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?"
872,"He fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know."
873,You're wrong. It is my business. You may be the only one that can stop these dragons.
879,"That's why the inn is called Dead Man's Drink, the farm is called Corpselight Farm, and so on. I suppose it's sort of a running joke."
886,"Your invitation, please."
887,"Ahrk fin Kel lost prodah, do ved viing ko fin krah, tol fod zeymah win kein meyz fundein!"
888,"As you command, my lord. But, the issue could be solved another way."
890,"You promised me, Hjalti. You promised that when we sacked Hroldan, you would make me your sworn brother."
892,"Treasure, that's what! Get off your scaly rump and let's go."
893,"But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone. "
894,"That's what you said last week, and the week before that. Now go, before I call a guard."
896,"After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation."
897,So you know what it's like to have your life in someone else's hands. Why should they get to decide? Isn't judgment for the gods?
902,How do you feel?
909,"You need to be careful in this city. Never know who you can trust, these days."
912,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!"
916,"Not that I require validation, of course. There are just some - and I shan't name names - who would disagree."
917,"Pilgrim or not, if I were you, I'd move right through our backwards little town."
919,"I'll give you another chance, but watch yourself."
923,"What brings you, wayfarer grim, to wander here, in Sovngarde, souls-end, Shor's gift to honored dead?"
924,"Thank you for the blessing, I'll put this to good use."
926,"There's only the hilt left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?"
933,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
935,I trust this is something important?
940,I'd better get going.
942,"The guards in Dragonsreach say you've aided the Jarl. On behalf of Whiterun, I thank you."
944,"I don't owe you money, do I?"
947,Good hunting.
949,"Well, I'm quite sure I've never been interrupted like this before... the audacity!..."
951,"And just who in Mara's name are you, anyway? Hmm? Come here, telling me my business. And for what? To help a... a... a fool!"
952,That would be acceptable. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
953,At this point they don't care what happens to him and neither do I. Best to just kill him and be done with it.
958,"Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again."
962,"Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them."
964,"Tell him, Ulfric."
965,"""May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty."""
966,"Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away!"
971,I have some questions for you. I'm trying to find someone.
980,Get over to Morthal.
983,It ended the war and saved the Empire to fight another day.
988,"If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard."
992,"I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me!"
993,Now I know you've come by for more than just a visit. What did you bring?
994,It would seem our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.
996,Hahahaha!
999,No one can save you now!
1005,"Aye. I've worked on a few moorings here and there for it. Most of the ship captains are superstitious about who works on their vessels, though."
1006,I need you on your feet. We're in trouble here.
1007,Interesting... They know more of our plans than I expected...
1010,"If the Night Mother really did give you an order to talk to a contact, we'd be mad to ignore it."
1011,"Have you ever heard of the expression, ""the scale of the Argonian that bit you?"""
1014,"I've thought this through, and it's the only way. She's too far gone, too corrupted by the Hags. At least in death she can be free again."
1015,Only your death or an apology will restore my family's honor. Last chance.
1016,"I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, Arch-Mage."
1021,I'll have your head!
1023,"All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway."
1024,Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market the other day?
1027,Interesting. Same dragon...
1028,Speak. Khajiit will listen until all the sugars in the world turn sour.
1029,This'll just take a moment...
1030,"Oh gods, my ears!"
1033,Humph. Who's running the Silver-Bloods? You or your brother? You need to tell Thongvor that he should settle this himself or step down.
1047,But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back.
1048,Grew up in a stronghold. Every Orc girl tended the forge at some point.
1051,"The people saw fit to name me Jarl, and I don't intend to let them down."
1052,"Now if you'll excuse me. The East Empire Company has several accounts, and it's up to me to balance them."
1053,Your death will be swift!
1054,Can you tell me more about what you saw?
1058,"Should you prove him guilty or innocent, I will reward you."
1061,"Well, after I fled Morrowind during the eruption, I made my way here... my family had purchased this farm and its all we had left."
1062,"I still can't believe it. You, the Arch-Mage? Never would have guessed it."
1064,"Thank you, friend."
1065,"You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them."
1074,"I've got a letter and a lot of gold. Something about it being your inheritance? Oh, and... sorry for your loss."
1075,Come on! You know you want what's in that chest. Just walk toward it!
1080,"There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking."
1085,That's a fine potion you've put together.
1088,"You come up to me, fists raised? You looking for a beating?"
1090,You'd be saving my life. Again. I know I probably seemed ungrateful... I've just been so scared. Expecting a knife at my throat any minute.
1093,"You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip."
1098,"I once killed six men, single-handed, while rescuing my brothers-in-arms from ambush by an Imperial patrol."
1105,"My father was a Legionnaire, and his before him. I guess I never considered doing anything else."
1106,The imperial butchers are on their way. Get home and lock your doors!
1107,"I may be new around here, but at least I know how to follow the rules."
1113,"The wood elf may run a stall in the city, but he retreats to the plains outside Whiterun to hunt. Kill him there, and no one will bear witness..."
1117,Ha! I like you.
1120,"Maybe you can help me. You know, by way of making amends for getting me into this mess."
1123,Not too bad. A few of the guests from the upcoming wedding have placed orders.
1128,I'll live to drink another day!
1129,Ride strong.
1133,"Aye, and she's added more traps now as well... A moment of silence for our fallen friend..."
1135,Let me know if there's anything else you need.
1137,I'm on your side!
1141,Yep.
1142,You hear the news? Those damn mages blew up Winterhold! Guess it was just a matter of time...
1143,That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A heroine of the people. A true daughter of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
1144,"A wise choice, my friend. After all, what would a common adventurer know about the complexities of finance?"
1150,Here. Some of my best armor. Wear it well.
1154,"Well, I don't know."
1161,"Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if they come 'round. And if you're never seen or heard from agin."
1162,I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak...
1164,The fall forest makes me miss my childhood; playing among the towering trees in Valenwood and living with my brethren.
1167,"It's a clan of giants. The war is driving them out of their lands, and they've started attacking settlements."
1171,The Blades killed them all centuries ago. Nobody asks to hear that lay anymore.
1172,Talk to me again if you prove yourself to Brynjolf.
1173,"There's a lever, right there in the center. Hurry, before more of them show up!"
1174,Praefect.
1175,It's true that Whiterun is dangerously exposed as long as the Stormcloaks hold Markarth...
1181,"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
1186,"My weapons will someday be as strong as my mother's, and Malacath will be pleased with me."
1189,"Now, you're supposed to get something for your trouble, aren't you? How about some gold? People seem to like that, I notice."
1191,Oh.
1193,"The Imperial City's so far from here, it might as well be on one of the moons. And yet the Empire thinks it can tell us what to do an' how to live."
1195,I hope so. But you'll forgive me if I don't assume that something's true just because the Greybeards say so.
1198,How can I?
1200,"One of the servants had a wonderful idea. Fireproofing Dragonsreach. In case of attack by, um... air."
1202,Perhaps we might share a carriage after the party?
1203,I hope so. I can't stand this city anymore.
1204,"I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me!"
1207,"Cookware, knives and other goods for the home, all at reasonable prices!"
1208,Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent or allow it to generate its own field?
1212,Very well.
1214,I'll tell you anything. Anything! Just please stop... hurting me...
1218,"Now, you tell me when you're ready and we'll get started."
1219,"And what of your latest, Arnbjorn. Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?"
1222,"I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing... and no one skims!"
1225,"Look, call me crazy if you like, but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal path."
1226,What did you hear?
1229,"Ah, so it is not just dreams then. I have seen this."
1235,Well... I'll let you go about your business.
1238,Should we consider investigating the matter?
1239,"First, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. We aim to confiscate it from the rebels."
1240,Think maybe we should jump the guards when they come down next?
1242,I thought Laelette left to join the war. I hadn't heard from her since she left.
1250,Thank you. Honor dictates something in return. I hope you find this pleasing.
1253,The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.
1254,Name's Valdr. I hunt out of Falkreath.
1262,Captain Volf of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established.
1263,Congratulations. You've altered the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
1265,"Well, I'm going to look around some more. See what the old Blades left for us."
1266,"Now, Sergius knows what I want. I'm hoping he can get it done quickly."
1273,"Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of the Emperor Pelagius III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane monarch. "
1274,She doesn't have the scar.
1275,"Hey, you. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
1278,"Inn's closed. Bar's still open, though."
1279,It seems we may have an agreement.
1283,"Wha... what? Oh, it's one of you people."
1284,General Tullius needs more money for the war effort. We need the funds to arm and provision more troops.
1286,I know more than most. I trained with the Greybeards at High Hrothgar when I was a boy.
1288,"Down in the Ratway Warrens. Nice place, if you don't mind the stench, rats, and assorted lowlifes as neighbors."
1290,"To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs."
1291,Fine. We do it your way. For now.
1298,"Don't misunderstand me, friend. I like my quiet, and I like to read. But you trifle with my ship, my crew, or my captain? I will kill you."
1300,"What? Err, nothing!"
1305,"First off, there's a band of Imperials hiding in a nearby village. We're going to flush them out and put them to the sword."
1311,I'd wager I could crack rock faster than anyone. Even you.
1313,"It seems our enemies have no end of spies, saboteurs and assassins to send against us."
1314,Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.
1316,"That's how I consoled myself for years, after I'd sealed this place shut and vowed never to let anyone open it."
1317,What's on your mind?
1320,Aren't you... embarrassed?
1322,We shout.
1324,There is one final aspect we wish for you to explore. For a strong love can withstand storms and even survive death.
1326,Booooo.
1330,"Yeah, you're right. Maybe it's not the best idea."
1332,"To bring Ulfric his rightful glory, I would hammer a thousand shields."
1333,"You have something at your College, don't you? Something immensely powerful. Beyond anything I'd anticipated. What is it?"
1336,"Again? You just had an ""extended hunt"" last month. To the Pine Forest, wasn't it."
1337,Fancy a crawl through a moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?
1343,It means living such that your Shield-Siblings would proudly say they fought at your side.
1344,"Here I'll show you on your map so you can stay away. Please, if you can help me let me know or get out of my way so I can try to find a priest."
1352,"I remember her. Her stance. The way she walked. A trained warrior, no doubt."
1353,"Mallus is teaching me everything he knows about brewing. Hopefully, I can take over his position some day."
1355,We can talk after I find out what's going on.
1358,"Wilhelm was pleased with the delivery, well done."
1359,"Same as ever. Trying to keep from freezing to death, trying to keep food on the table."
1360,It was important we reclaimed the Reach. Letting Ulfric control the flow of silver was a mistake. One I'm glad we've finally corrected.
1361,"So, has my bow turned up yet?"
1363,A group of them has holed up in the Reach.
1364,"When we destroy the rebellion, perhaps the Thalmor will call off their damned inquisitions. It's just making things worse."
1366,"You never talk much about yourself, do you Horik? I swear, these past 30 years you've been at my side, and I think I barely know you."
1367,I'd take it to Calixto. He's got a good eye for pieces like that.
1368,"Gods, this is hers, isn't it?"
1373,Leave this place... Leave this place...
1376,"My heart goes out to Clan Shatter-Shield. Kin murdered, family warhammer stolen... There's no fairness in all that."
1377,Prove yourselves to me!
1380,Huh. Heard you broke out of Cidhna Mine with those Forsworn. Do you have any idea how many died?
1387,Someday I'll take over the mill... when I'm old enough.
1389,"And by the Eight, aren't you fortunate that my steward has just the place for you to buy."
1391,Glad to hear Gulum-Ei got what he deserved. That lizard owes me big for a bad shipment of Shadowbanish Wine he tried to pass off on me.
1392,"And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, sir!"
1402,There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking.
1408,"If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me in."
1415,"Hey, Svana... I hear you like Dark Elves. Perhaps I could should you what a real Dark Elf can do to you."
1416,"""Windhelm's an easy posting!"" they said. Guess they didn't count on Ulfric's little uprising."
1419,I hope there aren't any more.
1420,"Very well. I can't stop you. But I can't bear to watch it, either. "
1423,Get down there and join Galmar on the front line.
1424,Word on the street says that the Thieves Guild is coming back into its own in Markarth so I figured...
1426,"Troll's blood, what happened to you Pavo?"
1427,"Sorry Lady Dinya, but I've been busy of late."
1432,These jobs aren't going to finish themselves you know.
1434,"I suppose that risk always coexisted with his line of work, I just never thought his luck would run out."
1436,That's it! We're pushing them back!
1437,"If the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay your bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive."
1438,There's more of them somewhere around here.
1445,By the gods! I assume you have proof.
1452,"The crown should be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open."
1454,"Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it?"
1455,Is that so?
1457,"If it's important, maybe Tolfdir knows. He seems to know a lot."
1458,"As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas."
1459,Come back anytime if you need a remedy.
1464,"I've seen you walking with a bit of pain sometimes, Horik."
1467,No. It's some sort of crazy contraption Mercer commissioned for quick escapes.
1470,We'd better keep moving. I feel like that dragon might be up there watching us right now.
1471,"I know the High King invited them here, but he didn't ask me or anyone else first. Maybe he should have."
1472,"Avulstein, put that down! He's here to help us find Thorald!"
1476,"In some parts of the world, wielding a weapon openly like that is an invitation to combat..."
1482,"No more.... No more.... I submit, Molag Bal. I submit!"
1486,"Ah, there you are. I've been waiting for you to arrive."
1487,Don't see that every day.
1488,Why the drawn weapon? Is it contemplating violence?
1495,Is there anything else I can get for you?
1499,"Die, you filthy beast!"
1502,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
1503,"Now, clear your mind and breathe deeply. Good concentration is very important for spellcasting."
1504,"Even I'll admit it hasn't been the Empire's finest hour. But it wasn't like the Emperor had any choice, did he?"
1505,I grow restless. As does my blade.
1506,Go ahead. Whatever you want to know. Nothing held back.
1507,"Even though the Phial was damaged, I still think your efforts deserve reward."
1510,"So, you're the new recruit everyone's been talking about, eh? I guess it's about time we talked."
1513,"He'd beat me up, dump mead on my head, anything he could get away with. Once he even slipped a beehive into my bed. "
1514,"Make sure you make him pay for what he did to Gallus... heck, for what he did to all of us."
1515,So he has talked! I knew it!
1521,That's right! Worst innkeeper in all of Skyrim!
1523,I hooked up with a guild in Valenwood... I think they called themselves the Silver Crescents. Spent quite a few years doing jobs for them.
1537,"Please, Listener. Release my soul, and let Sithis be the judge."
1539,So I need someone to find that proof for me.
1542,You looking for work? Got a sailor who thought running a gang of thieves would be more money than hauling my cargo.
1544,"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear."
1546,"Oh, I should've known she'd try it again!"
1549,City's got eyes. Be careful when you're out there.
1555,"Better than nothing, I guess. But Tullius will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Riften without a fight."
1557,I thought today was going to be boring.
1562,"Then, well... you got a taste. Stronger, faster."
1563,"There's a rift here in Skyrim, and can't neither magic nor the passin' of time make it right."
1564,"Etienne must know something related to the dragons... who else might know? Greasy Thom... no, they'd see right through him..."
1566,We done?
1568,"Truth is, we are in no danger whatsoever. Killing an Emperor can be useful, but befriending one? Now that's beneficial - as I'm sure you'd all agree."
1569,"If the Dark Brotherhood discovered I had been a Morang Tong, they would come after me with a vengeance."
1576,I like your robes. Are you a sorcerer? From the College?
1577,"Excuses are not acceptable in my court. When I ask for something I expect results, and I expect them immediately."
1578,That's the Honningbrew Meadery. Supposed to be a big rivalry between them and the Black-Briars of Riften.
1581,Take this as a token of our gratitude.
1587,"Sacked by the elves in the infamous ""Night of Tears,"" not much is known about what happened to Saarthal."
1589,"Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours."
1590,I'm staying out of this.
1597,How can I help you today?
1598,"If you can goad a target into attacking you first, you may even find any local guards coming to your aid."
1599,"Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day."
1601,How dare that little fool! And right under my nose!
1602,So there's nothing more to be said.
1610,I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.
1614,"Remember, your mind is the best weapon you have."
1615,And what might you need? Hmm?
1618,I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party.
1622,Pathetic!
1629,"There's a group of cutthroats out there right now that Ulfric doesn't lift a finger to bring to justice, as long as they don't threaten Nord land."
1630,"Hey, that isn't yours!"
1631,"Lacking the heart of a dead god myself, I was attempting to substitute a rather specific soul gem. The ahh, the one you helped me acquire."
1635,You got business at the stables?
1636,I need another drink.
1638,Maybe we can swap stories about our adventures over a mug of ale at the inn!
1640,"I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!"
1645,My father says we need to just get on with our lives. Like it's that easy.
1646,The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
1649,You were ranting when you got here  but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.
1651,"I'm sorry lass, I... I can't..."
1652,"Yeah, well, don't expect many more stories like that in my future. I'm getting old. Being that amazing takes too much damn effort."
1654,"Too many drinking games, too many bets, and I'm too old to ever raise the coin on my own."
1655,This place has had you shaking in your armor ever since we arrived.
1656,"Anyway, our wares are strong and the prices fair. What else matters?"
1659,"We should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor."
1660,"Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords... but, I've come to respect them."
1661,"Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be playing hard to get when I spoke to her earlier."
1664,Don't say that out loud. Not here. And the answer's still no.
1667,Whoa.
1668,It worked... you did it...
1671,"Yes, milady. That unpleasantness at Helgen supposedly involved a dragon. It killed several soldiers before it departed."
1672,I see that mortals have become arrogant while I slept.
1677,"What is my freedom worth, if the price is my brother's life?"
1680,They're the worst kind. Even the Dark Brotherhood abides by a strict set of rules and tradition. These thieves are just rabble.
1681,"You're making waves around here. I like that. If you ever want to talk about anything, you let me know."
1683,Gonna get cold tonight. Might want to at least cover your delicates.
1685,"Thank you, sir. Go right in."
1686,Is there something I can help you with?
1696,"Come on, hurry up."
1697,"Not now, Braith. Go... go ask your father."
1705,Arkay keeps the cycle. He watches us in life and death.
1707,I'll let you stay. This time.
1712,Looks like you got someone already.
1715,"Talk of strange happenings at Autumnshade Clearing, just north of the lake. My guess? Spriggans."
1716,"Narri, do you think the war will ever end?"
1717,"Just stop trying to change me, mother! I'm not a baby anymore! I'm almost a woman! I... I can't be who I want to be!"
1722,It's fine... I had to tell someone I suppose.
1725,We're attacking Riften. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
1727,"What a... fine idea, my Jarl. However, I would suggest we wait until the war has ended."
1731,"If anyone saw anything, step forward. Otherwise, step away from the body!"
1732,"This is our homeland, Tullius. All the blood spilled in this war is on your head."
1736,"I know, I know. I'm hurrying."
1744,"I am. I came into Arkay's light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics."
1748,About how the Divines cursed you. What horrible thing did you do to deserve it?
1749,Hardly likely.
1753,"His shrine lies northwest of Largashbur. I am unsure that he will listen, but it cannot hurt."
1755,The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!
1757,"No, no, no. What I need to do is to reverse that. Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent and then apply it with the proper incantation."
1762,It's going to take forever to sift through all this.
1766,"We intend to prove the superiority of Mer over Man, one century at a time."
1768,"Right you are, elf! Or even from the rebels, if they've got enough money to make a competitive offer."
1769,Absolutely. Here you are. Be well.
1770,You have to hold still or this isn't going to work.
1772,Olaf!
1775,I've been running interference for you around here. I don't think anyone's caught on to our little campaign. Yet.
1779,"Ah, another plaything for my collection."
1780,"You are banished! Alduin, we shout you out from all our endings unto the last!"
1784,I'm going to find you.
1785,"Cut me down, or you'll never get the claw!"
1788,"The Fear spell has saved the life of many an Illusion mage. If you could cast it on the seal here on the ground, that would prove your skill."
1791,"We're making our money back, bit by bit. Every extra bit of work helps..."
1793,"And then there's Borvir and Rundi. Twins, though they rarely agreed on anything."
1795,"A Nightingale? Oh, I had no idea. My apologies."
1797,"If I was threatening you, believe me, you'd know it."
1798,So we scrounge whatever we can from around the tundra. 
1799,"Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time."
1801,Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar.
1804,"Oh, I quite like living in the hall. Mother says it's an honor to live there and serve Morthal."
1811,"What's wrong, dear friend? You seem... distracted today."
1813,"Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed."
1814,"I expected no less of you. And once again, you have not disappointed. "
1816,This looks like some sort of lever puzzle.  We'll have to figure out the correct order to flip them.
1819,"Too lazy to walk, eh? Well, you've found the right place."
1820,"What's there to tell? It's mostly gone now, thanks to those damned mages in the College."
1822,The Mercy of Stendarr does not extend to Daedra worshippers.
1824,"Balgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war."
1825,Worthless mercenaries.
1829,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
1832,Hahaha!
1833,The only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking.
1837,The Braidwood Inn's up that way. I know the innkeeper - Iddra. Nice lady.
1840,"Like they knew exactly where we'd be. That was... two days ago, now."
1842,"Ugh, you reek. Get out of my way."
1844,"Alduin, feyn do jun, kruziik vokun staadnau, voth aan bahlok wah diivon fin lein!"
1847,I call forth that power! Accept the soul that we offer!
1849,"Now, let's pretend this never happened, shall we?"
1854,"Zok frini grind ko grah drun viiki, Dovahkiin."
1857,"Best leave the past buried, I say."
1863,I mean look at this place. I've never seen so much wealth down here. You've made us all rich.
1864,"It doesn't happen again, or else I'll have you thrown in jail. Clear?"
1867,"Come on, father. There's nothing more to be said here."
1870,Maybe you've already met Camilla Valerius? 
1875,Our vengeance will come.
1876,This Dwemer lockbox. Look upon it and wonder. 
1878,Namira spoke to you? I knew this feast was going to be something.
1881,"This is the royal armor, lass. Maybe in a few years."
1884,"Well met, kinsman. What brings you to Whiterun?"
1889,"Oh, but Cicero can't talk to you. You've been naughty, naughty. I think you need to clear this whole mess up with Nazir."
1892,The warm sand of Elsweyr is far away from here.
1893,"The Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Each bard adds to the Edda in his or her time."
1894,I can't wait to see what the future brings.
1896,"My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!"
1897,"Hey, kinsman. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
1898,Mage up there! In the tower!
1905,Never. The College cannot become mired in local politics. What happens inside these walls is our worry. What happens outside is theirs.
1908,Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine that she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.
1909,"Such blasphemies are the calling of mages, not followers of the Way."
1910,"Ah... so tender. Come here, you juicy morsel!"
1911,Who's the fool now?
1915,I'll buy everything you've dug up.
1917,Now you I like. I've been getting sick of the pushovers that usually walk in here.
1922,"Indeed. Come, there is much to be done."
1925,Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working.
1928,"By the Nine, I'd pay good money for a pint of ale to warm my bones!"
1933,It will be good to finally be able to return home.
1937,Now don't get all upset. Here. Take it.
1938,"I will hear no more of this, Harrald. Do you understand me? No more!"
1939,Purchase something or leave. Those are your options.
1940,"Excellent. That's one less settlement in Imperial hands, and one more sign to all that our cause is true."
1943,"But yes, the books. The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes."
1947,"Oh, I'm just a servant, dear. You want to talk to one of the Companions, I'm sure."
1949,"Have you heard of Blackreach? ""Cast upon where Dwemer cities slept, the yearning spire hidden learnings kept."""
1950,You always were a quick study.
1952,"Very well, I'll make the arrangements. The next time you visit your house, your new furnishings will be in place."
1953,"I'm sure she would want you to be happy, father. Entertaining the guests and drinking and making your lewd jokes like before."
1955,If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.
1956,Welcome to Bits and Pieces. I'm sure you'll find what you need here.
1957,Getting tired yet?
1959,"It's a shame, isn't it?"
1960,"I've been thinking, would you like to join me in hunting?"
1962,My mother was a strong woman... she's the one who instructed me on my swordfighting techniques. Can you imagine?
1975,"""When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls"""
1976,"What's the matter, I thought you people were used to indentured servitude."
1978,The Keeper is a sacred position within the Dark Brotherhood. Ask yourself - do you trust the wisdom of our Lady?
1981,Let me know if you see anything you like.
1985,"Small clan... maybe twenty men. We'd raid villages, rob caravans... but it was always about the killing for them."
1986,"But once Alduin is defeated - then it will be the Empire's turn. Remember - ""Evgir Unslaad."""
1989,"Seeing as how Riften is home to the Thieves Guild, maybe we can work something out if you have trouble with the law. For the right price."
1993,"Used to have their own kingdom, till the Nords came, now they're at the bottom of the hay pile."
1997,"They're good company if you want to study necromancy in peace, though."
1998,Who dares disturb my rest?
2004,I guess I can spare him a few beatings. Deal.
2006,"Hroar's crying is keeping me up at night. I'll give you one chance to talk the tears out of him, or he's getting the belt."
2007,"What is it, Orc?"
2008,"I've fought in more battles than I've got years of life in me. Pay my fee and I'll put that experience to work for you, friend."
2009,It bothers me that fewer people come to Windhelm these days.
2011,"He introduced me to Gallus, and that was it. I've been here ever since."
2012,Mind you don't cross Tassius. He's in charge around here.
2016,"In fact, if you'd fetch my blade from him I'd be most appreciative."
2018,I'd make it worth your while. No one would notice a few missing ingots out of the next shipment.
2019,"Come in, come in! I was just about to take a break."
2021,Is this punishment for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so?
2022,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
2023,"We're not going in there until the Jarl's men come to clear them out, so I wouldn't go down there."
2028,Aaaaaaaaaaa....
2029,Yes. He'll do.
2030,Do dogs count?
2034,"They were crushed, of course, but the survivors - the Forsworn - still lurk in the wilds and make the Reach dangerous for honest folk."
2039,Hand it over to me. I will ask Azura to restore the Star to its original purity.
2045,"Care to have a drink with me, sweet Sigrid?"
2050,"Sheathe those claws, Khajiit..."
2054,"Speak with the Corrupt Agent at the Penitus Oculatus Outpost, in Dragon Bridge. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!  "
2057,My husband. He was the blacksmith up at Castle Dour.
2058,Look silly! As if you could look any sillier than you do now.
2064,"Think you might be in the wrong place, friend."
2066,"Yeah, we can do that. I'm thinking a sewer grate on the outskirts of Dawnstar. Leads to a tunnel, then inside. You'll be in or out, quick as a coney."
2071,He's the housecarl of Falkreath. You know what that means? He's the bodyguard to the Jarl himself. So be careful.
2075,Thank Shor I have a lot of years before I have to worry about that!
2076,"I'd rather have two bottles of mead then two wenches, friend."
2081,We're... at odds about my charity. She thinks the people in this town have become lazy and expecting a handout.
2082,"If you need an apothecary, the White Phial has respectable stock."
2083,"Thongvor may be the head of the family, but I'm the hands."
2087,"If you're thinking of applying, talk to Viarmo in Solitude."
2091,"I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm sending you to Windhelm."
2093,True enough.
2095,"Said he's a writer. Don't know what kind of job that is, but it must earn him some pretty coin. He's paid up for the next few months."
2096,"Stay clear of that College, if you know what's good for you."
2097,"The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing."
2098,Phew!
2099,So long as you can back up those words with steel.
2106,"I don't have time to chase shadows, I've got better things to do."
2107,Money's been tight since the mill burned down. My wife won't let me forget it.
2112,"When they left, he took off after them. Stole supplies and books from the College, I suppose as a way to ingratiate himself."
2114,I'm not very good for anything more than smithing nails right now.
2115,"I don't care how many Colleges they build, or how much the sea swallows up. I'll outlast them all."
2116,But I am not the Listener. Oh no. You are the Listener! You heard the words! And everything will soon be put right.
2123,"Your choice, friend."
2125,Don't say words you don't mean.
2128,Maven has been nagging us about her request. Any thoughts?
2129,I gave up this kind of thing a long time ago.
2130,To harness it is to know. The fundaments. The Dwemer lockbox hides it from me.
2132,"All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober."
2135,"When I arrived, Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound an arrow pierced his throat."
2139,Look at you! You're as filthy as a pig in a pen!
2143,"Until our next meeting, if such is fated."
2144,Not much exciting happens around here. You're as like as not to be bored to death if you stay too long.
2146,Do not let your easy mastery of the Voice tempt you into the arrogance of power that has been the downfall of many Dragonborn before you.
2151,"And it shows, I've seen horkers with smaller guts."
2153,"It's not true, I assure you."
2154,"Another day, another settlement gets attacked. No place in the Reach is safe from the Forsworn."
2155,You sure you want it to come to this?
2157,"We honor the bravest fighters, but I have seen many types of bravery in my travels."
2164,Yyyaaaarrgghh!
2165,"Oh yes. After all, what's the point in being miserable all the time?"
2166,"We have angered Malacath, and so we must be punished."
2170,"Damn it, there's got to be a way out of here!"
2173,Would you raise your shield in her defense?
2178,"Good. That's what I want to hear. Now go make it happen, soldier."
2179,"I spent almost ten years at High Hrothgar, learning the Way of the Voice. Then the Great War came... I couldn't stand missing it."
2180,"I did. I was known as Ghorbash gro-Dushnikh in those days, in honor of my homeland."
2183,Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion.
2187,Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to set what you see on a canvas so you'd have that memory forever?
2188,"What? You want it for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - don't you? I won't let her have you!"
2189,You there. Have you performed your voice exercises today?
2191,"Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to rely on Onmund."
2192,"With my husband's new found religion, what I do with our coin and what I do all day seem less important to him. Suits me."
2193,Come back when you grow a backbone.
2196,"The Dragon from the dawn of time, who devours the souls of the dead!"
2197,"The people here work so hard, and they never allow themselves a moment of fun. It's such a pity. It won't last forever though."
2198,"Here, take these as well, they may prove useful for your journey."
2199,Hey! Stop that.
2201,"They're over there, next to that house!"
2202,"Ah, it's not been more than a few days since they came down the last time."
2204,"That man was, by far, the most insufferable decoy the Emperor has ever employed. I'm glad he's dead. Ah, but I'm even happier that you killed him."
2205,It hardly matters though. The door to the stairs is securely locked. There's no way anyone without the key can get in. So don't you worry about it.
2210,I can't believe we actually killed a dragon!
2211,"Goodbye, sir."
2212,You're too slow and stupid to take it from me.
2222,That spell looks dangerous...
2224,Stop right there! Were I can see you.
2225,"Someday, you can have your own stronghold."
2227,We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find anything else useful.
2228,I had to get this for you when I saw it. I hope you like it.
2229,"Ah, a visitor. Old Hroldan Inn has hundreds of years of history, friend."
2231,"Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight."
2235,"When I told you the set had to be complete, I left out a small detail... I honestly didn't think you'd ever get this far."
2238,"Please, I beg you, don't tell Sibbi where I am. He'll kill me!"
2240,"We have, of course, severed all ties with the mage in question, but the Jarl isn't appeased."
2250,Mara bless you for agreeing to help us.
2253,"Well, sir, it's a farmhouse. It's not going to be as clean as your house in the city. "
2257,"I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books."
2260,"If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tulius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim."
2263,"My what, now? I've never kept a journal, I can assure you."
2264,It's too bad the orphanage ain't letting us kids get adopted. I'd be the best son ever.
2265,We'll pay whatever it takes. But we must have more swords for the Imperial soldiers.
2266,"Our wedding is soon, under Mara's loving eyes. It'll be perfect."
2268,"Some advice, friend. That armor won't offer much protection in a real fight."
2272,"You're like me, eh? Don't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons."
2278, 
2281,Christer?  He's here?
2283,Then you should know that Louis and I have a certain... history.
2287,"I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes."
2289,"The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements. It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and general meetings."
2294,"All right. Had I known the deal would bring me this much trouble, I never would have accepted the gold."
2295,"Romlyn, I've been meaning to speak to you. I did a count at the meadery and we're four cases short... again."
2298,"You can see Azura's Shrine for miles on a clear day. You people did a good job with that, I'll say it to anybody."
2300,This key opens one of my stashes in the basement of the meadery. Help yourself to any of its contents.
2302,Never see me strutting around like that!
2303,"Come on, we can't stop now. We have to keep moving!"
2305,"No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon Bridge. However, there is one other option..."
2309,"Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you elsewhere."
2315,"You need to find and kill Safia, the captain of the pirate ship Red Wave."
2316,"My n'wah of a father thought he could pull my strings... ""continue the Hlaalu tradition."" Bah! I left all that nonsense behind."
2319,She only lets us out in the yard once. In the morning. And she just stands there watching us.
2320,Magic! I'm not sure I approve.
2322,You can't keep quittin' jobs when it strikes your fancy. You're going to make us all look like a bunch of amateurs. Think next time.
2330,"I can't believe Grelod is dead. I had no love for the woman, but to be murdered, in cold blood..."
2332,"The dirt, the moisture... it's disgusting. Who wants to spend their life living like a skeever?"
2336,"Irileth, send a detachment to Riverwood at once."
2338,"Proudspire Manor, now there's a fine home. Up for sale, too. If you're interested, talk to the steward, in the keep."
2339,"Ahem. Mi mi mi mi. Pardon me. Just, um, warming up. Never know when I may be called upon for a ballad."
2341,You don't have to tell me that.
2351,Listen to me and you might learn something.
2354,M'aiq is tired now. Go bother somebody else.
2356,In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how much coin we carry.
2360,"And like always, the boy lacks any kind of spine. He'll need some convincing."
2361,"Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn."
2364,Keep a sharp eye out.
2366,Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so.
2370,"Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale blood!"
2372,This library used to be filled with arcane volumes. Now look at it; almost everything's been burned.
2376,She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every thief in Tamriel.
2378,"I think I've got a handle on it, but Orichalcum is confusing."
2381,"I'm a bit busy at the moment, what did you want?"
2384,"If they want my city, they're going to have to take it from me personally."
2386,Go ahead. What is it?
2395,I... I'll get his things in order. 
2397,"I'll put it plainly. You can claim your sword, or you can keep your wife. If you set foot outside the gate, I won't be here when you return."
2399,Is it? This is disappointing.
2402,Only a few things came today. Cedran said he'd drop it off later.
2403,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a mine that needs new workers to fill it."
2405,"Your concerns are duly noted, Legate, but unfounded. I assure you, this war will be over in another six months."
2406,"Sweetheart, did you move my pickaxe? "
2407,"I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for success."
2412,We're getting out of here. Now.
2413,"You ever need another blade at your side, just ask. Wouldn't mind seeing how you handle a few trolls."
2415,I will take back my family's castle.
2416,"Here, I want you to have this. It was my father's but I'm certain you'll put it to good use."
2417,"One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love."
2419,"I'm dying for a rest. I swear, I could lie down right now, and just sleep forever."
2420,Wake up!
2421,Thank you for saving me from Alva. I was completely under her evil spell. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to Helgi and my wife.
2424,My lord. Please. You have to listen.
2426,We will see.
2431,You've dug your own grave!
2432,Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.
2438,Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.
2439,Stay away from Camilla.
2440,You hard of hearing? I run this smelter. And I'm late meeting our silver quota. What do you want?
2442,"Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it and you'll have me as a customer for life."
2444,"Collect the Rueful Axe from Rimerock Burrow, and I believe we'll have a deal."
2446,Hey! Over here! Get me out of here!
2447,"One way or another, get me those documents."
2449,I've never seen anything quite like that.
2450,When you're in your grave and I'm standing over it. Now get out of my way!
2452,"Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send him in."
2453,"It was a few years ago. A few of the mages got overconfident and were exiled. They had no talent, anyway."
2454,"I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you."
2455,"I'm calling it ""Calcelmo's Guide to the Falmer Tongue."" It will revolutionize the way we understand those ancient beings."
2457,"That's the spirit. Vilkas, here, will get started on that."
2458,"Ah, you must mean my little adventure on the ship..."
2465,"No Sam, no protection. Time to die."
2466,I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.
2467,Those cursed mages... It's their fault Winterhold is gone.
2472,"Kolskeggr, overrun with Forsworn, what next?"
2475,I help my mother Arob with the hunt. We bring much meat and skins to the stronghold.
2477,"This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only."
2478,I've started seeing the Companions as a kind of family.
2479,"When you get back to Riften, tell Delvin this new arrangement's working out quite well."
2480,Remind me why we even bother to allow him to be a part of the Guild.
2481,"We don't get many visitors through here, unless their headed up to High Hrothgar of course."
2484,Whatever you say.
2486,Help!
2490,Shiny trinkets for your good lady! All crafted by the great Eorlund Gray-Mane himself!
2492,How can I help a brother Nord?
2494,You can't argue with these mages. They'll attack you on sight.
2496,"I have to wonder... what does the Dragonborn do once he's summoned by the Greybeards? Can the Thu'um be taught, like any skill?"
2499,Just turn around and leave the city. That's the smart move.
2501,"I don't know what he's doing, but he won't get away with it."
2503,"Oh. I'm sorry. Well, it's good to have you here, anyway."
2506,Scholars say the Dwemer were an advanced culture. Ha! The Nords outlasted their entire race. So much for being advanced.
2508,"What's this? Some kind of code? ""Need as much iron ore as you can dig up...."""
2512,You're cheating!
2518,You're pushing your luck.
2519,Are you quite sure we need to be speaking?
2523,"But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties... erased. For a price. Something to think about."
2524,All right.
2525,"Lob will one day take my place, and bring honor to our tribe as I have."
2528,"Yes, that's probably for the best. I really shouldn't risk getting on Elenwen's bad side."
2530,A sharp mind beats a sharp blade any day. Words to live by.
2532,"We're outnumbered, but I have a plan."
2533,What do you want?
2535,Nordic ruins. Old. Secretive.
2541,Thank Talos you came along... I thought I was going to die down here.
2542,"She came through a while ago, wanted to know where she could get her hands on something valuable. Anything, really."
2543,Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.
2547,"Oh, you've saved me! Thank you so much. Who knows what they'd have done to me if you hadn't come along."
2550,"There's plenty of good wood around here, but I just can't harvest it all by myself. Everyone able-bodied is fighting."
2551,"They come in here once a week to clean out the bodies, grab any ore we've mined, and beat down the troublemakers."
2556,"A good bunch of men and women, who make too much a mess, if you ask me."
2559,Hern and I do so adore guests! These guards are such a bore.
2562,"It's no secret the Aretino boy is doing some ritual, trying to call the Dark Brotherhood. But who's going to stop him? Me? I'll have no part of that."
2567,Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma was released.
2569,"I met one of the caravan leaders, Ma'dran. He said he'd help get me started if I could bring him a mammoth's tusk. Easier said than done."
2571,"...picking pockets, now that's the real art... ...no rough stuff, just take it and go... ...hmph, don't sound like much fun, though..."
2572,"I wonder if we'll come across some bandits who've just finished roasting a rabbit on a spit. Maybe they'll have a keg of ale, too."
2577,"Hail, Nightingale! Luck has shined down on me and made me a rich man. Here is your cut, as promised."
2578,But I know things are said behind my back. Conversations cease when I enter rooms.
2585,Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel that even recognize the language?
2586,"So, you made it out of there alive. Ancano was right... you are dangerous."
2588,J'zargo is eager to hear how the scrolls are working.
2590,"Oh, and that busybody Viola Giordano. She's got her nose in everyone's business, which I guess is one way of being prominent."
2591,No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation?
2592,"Lazy good-for-nothing, isn't he? Sent you down here when I'm a stone's throw from the keep?"
2593, 
2595,"One of the guards said he saw a mage appear out of thin air. Claimed it was one of those Psijic Monks. Man's been hitting the skooma, I say."
2597,Of course. Take what you need.
2601,Get away from me.
2602,"Yeah, but she was a Nord. And a noble. Perfect Forsworn target."
2603,Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.
2610,"So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What is that?"
2614,"You've had more than enough. Besides, you still haven't paid for the last one."
2616,I'm sure she will prove most useful.
2620,Sometimes I'm surprised he's still the chief.
2624,"It's simple Orc smithing practice, my chief. Nothing that hasn't been passed down for years."
2628,Killing the Gourmet will leave an emptiness in the collective soul of Skyrim. This pleases me.
2629,"Welcome, child. "
2631,Leave now or suffer dire consequences.
2633,And killed them. In his honor.
2639,Thorald can't be left to those... monsters.
2641,That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate Rikke. Now then...
2644,Help me! Help!
2645,We tunneled into an old Nordic crypt. The whole place is crawling with draugr.
2648,"Hey, people have paid money for stranger things. Take our cow dung - we sell that by the wagon load."
2649,"Are you looking to work? The mines are nearby. You bring me ore, I'll give you coin."
2650,Are you Dragonborn?
2651,What do you say? Can you do this?
2653,I don't have any choice! I'm sorry!
2656,Are you two quite done?
2664,Maybe I will. What do you think about that?
2665,But he willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the vagaries of life and death.
2666,You've shown those monsters that they will no longer be tolerated in the Pale. Good work.
2668,At last.
2670,"You look a bit peaked. You sure you shouldn't be home, in bed?"
2671,Fiik!
2672,'Bout time. Brynjolf's been gettin' on me about money.
2673,Well then you'd better have something I really want to buy.
2675,The Legion will regain control of this city. Mark my words.
2676,Feel the bite of my axe!
2677,You think I don't know what you're up to? You think I can't destroy you?
2681,"Sadly, yes. Even the townsfolk have taken to calling her ""Grelod the Kind."" Her very existence has become something of a running joke."
2682,"You take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself in New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ta ta!"
2684,"And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort."
2685,"Hello there fellow, traveler. One itinerant minstrel and wandering wastrel, at your service."
2688,"I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages. "
2689,This one is honored by your friendship. I hope this gift does honor to you.
2693,What did you call me?
2695,"Hey, Khajiit. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
2696,"Yes, I'll be ready in a moment, I just need one more thing..."
2698,"I'm eleven years old, and I could take you."
2699,I wonder what Irileth is so excited about?
2700,"And so, you will die a heretic's death."
2701,There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
2703,"What about you? Have you... have you spoken to anyone? No.... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and saying!"
2707,I need you to collect some dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
2708,"It's hopeless. He told me. He's right, you know."
2716,"You'll want the Bannered Mare. See old Hulda, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead."
2719,"Ulfric's right-hand man, Galmar Stonefist, has located what he believes is the final resting place of the Jagged Crown."
2724,"I guess someone else will be taking his room, now."
2727,Another day in this graveyard.
2729,Oh really? Well I think your new helper here needs a guide.
2731,Madanach. The King in Rags.
2733,"It will have to do. Besides, if it came to blows, I'm sure the Snow-Shod's would come out here and assist us."
2734,"You are new, yes?"
2735,Let's begin again.
2738,The scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it.
2741,I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.
2746,Go. Out. Before I change my mind.
2748,They're a very old order. Pre-dated the Imperial Mages Guild by quite a bit.
2750,We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to the study of the arcane.
2754,"Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons."
2755,So be it.
2761,"Of course. But I can't just hand that over. Privacy, after all."
2765,For the Forsworn!
2766,And take this. A gift from the Jarl's personal stores.
2767,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
2768,Fine. Here's everything you need to know.
2777,Malyn's soul is beyond hope because his body is dead. But I'll be keeping you just slightly alive on this end.
2781,"If I were you, I'd go straight to the steward with this information."
2782,"Aw, that's so sweet of you! Thanks!"
2785,Enough to make a significant difference in the war.
2788,"Hurry, cut me down!"
2789,"Waste of time, then."
2794,"Well, what do you say, my brothers?"
2798,Speak.
2802,"Well, if it isn't the bully that goes around hurting people."
2808,"Nice try, but you don't scare me."
2820,"Yeah, your right. Probably a waste of your time anyway."
2823,"Now, is lavender an herb or a poison? Hmm...."
2825,What did you say? Get out of my sight!
2832,Yes. My collection of artifacts from a group that toppled an Empire.
2834,"Running a little light in the pockets, lass?"
2837,I feel like I can beat anyone.
2838,"From her reverie, we know the mind of our god."
2840,"Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen! Now go! Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn."
2841,Damn soldiers always trample my crops.
2842,"We chop trees, we mill the wood. What more would you want to know?"
2843,"Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please - eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!"
2844,"If you're looking for conversation, The Flagon isn't the place."
2845,"Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor."
2847,"Burnin' that banner was a nice touch, too. Should send a clear message to the Summerset Shadows that we're a force to be reckoned with."
2849,"There's talk of it, but I find it hard to believe."
2853,"Thank you, miss, I appreciate that."
2861,Don't come back.
2864,"Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe."
2865,"Hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one!"
2867,You would give your own coin to help my son? I'm moved by your compassion.
2870,I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've never seen before.
2874,Joor!
2875,"And you're right, at least as far as I'm concerned."
2877,"Father, I'm worried about Gadba and Mul. "
2878,You are like my brood to me. Here. A token.
2880,"Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war."
2882,"If you can learn to be subtle in rendering death, perhaps I will share more of my power with you."
2884,We need to move. Now!
2886,I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in life and in death.
2888,"I been a sailor for so long, I could navigate these rivers an' seas blindfolded."
2895,Shh. You mustn't speak about such things away from the shrine. Only you and your dinner guests can know.
2896,"If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands."
2901,"I need you to do me a favor, Dirge."
2911,What? Have you forgotten your oath to the Emperor?
2920,"It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but I've secured your exit out of the keep."
2921,"Need a room, talk to Delphine."
2923,I have to get to Markarth at once. Cut me loose.
2925,"I just try and do my job, and not to think about what's happened. Try to find what happiness I can."
2926,"I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale."
2930,Enthir is once again holding out on me. He refuses to deliver yet another item absolutely essential to my work!
2931,Most folk won't go near it now for fear it's cursed.
2933,Dibella is the Divine of Beauty. She is a patron deity to artists and bards and those who seek life's simple pleasures.
2938,How in the name of Akatosh... How do you have that?
2940, 
2941,"Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat."
2942,"I don't, I'm afraid. Ranmir didn't talk much about her after she'd left."
2943,"I've been trying to put those up around the city, to warn people. Have them keep their eyes open."
2951,"Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem."
2953,You've little time to glory in your accomplishments.
2954,You know about Talos? He founded the Empire!
2955,Where are you... get me down from this!
2958,They won't be expecting an attack from the inside.
2960,"I know you have a damn good reason for siding with Karliah, so I hope you can give it to them."
2964,"You come here, kill my assistants, disrupt my work... You've annoyed me, so I don't think I'll be giving you anything."
2966,Here we go.
2967,"Each caravan is obliged to pay dues, but in return a small portion of the profits are shared between them and the leader parcels out the routes."
2969,I will drink your blood and feast on your flesh!
2971,"Empire's in charge now, huh? Only a matter of time before we start getting bothered by them Thalmoricars... err, Justimors... Y'know, them elves. "
2972,"I don't get much time time off from the tavern, but I enjoy it when I do."
2973,I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in Ustengrav.
2974,"What of it, she says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos."
2979,May your road lead you to warm sands.
2980,"My wife was a good woman. She could be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I loved her just the same. Gods I miss her."
2983,"No? Well, then she hasn't gotten to you yet. But she will. And you don't you believe a word of it."
2984,Agh! Enough! This ends now!
2986,"Yes, yes. I'm your brother and I'm supposed to greet you respectfully. So ""hello."" There, satisfied?"
2988,We will avenge Kodlak. And they will know terror before the end.
2993,You haven't heard of the Silver-Blood family? They're the most important people in the Reach.
2998,I just wanted a little excitement. Something dangerous.
3002,Go on now. Time to get your hands bloody.
3008,"South of here, and west of the road, lies Cronvangr Cave. Stay away from that cursed place, and the vampires that call it home."
3010,"Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself."
3011,We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina.
3013,No one in the Jarl's court is above the charge of conspiring against the city. You're coming with us.
3015,"With Ulfric's troops here, Elisif will be forced to support his bid for High King. He secures the position and appears above reproach."
3016,"Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches."
3021,Grelka! Lower your voice before you get us both in trouble.
3023,The Gourmet. This is such an honor.
3026,"My master can be a bit short-tempered, but I've learned so much from him."
3027,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
3032,"Well met, friend. How can I help you?"
3033,"There is nothing else but philosophy to a dovah. It is no accident that we do battle with our Thu'um, our Voices."
3038,"Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do."
3042,"No Nord could have said it better! I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn."
3044,"The Mythic Dawn killed Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, triggering the events that lead to the Oblivion Crisis, when the Daedra invaded Tamriel."
3045,I'm glad to help any way I can.
3051,"Here, take this gift as a sign of the Empire's appreciation, and my own."
3054,We're right behind you.
3057,J'zargo sees what you are up to. Very well.
3060,"Unless, of course, you'd like to make some extra gold."
3062,"My skill in battle is unmatched. Fortunately for you, that skill can be bought."
3063,Our men are getting massacred out there. Damn Imperials.
3065,"But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal."
3071,"Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done."
3072,This is going to be terrible for business...
3073,Nenya's history of service is impeccable.  She truly is the Steward of Falkreath.
3076,I don't know!
3082,Pay me? You think this is about money?
3083,"Is that new batch of tomatoes ready for sale yet, Hillevi?"
3086,...Forsworn think they're so scary... Cicero will show you who's scary... Stupid Forsworn...
3087,Perhaps... 
3089,"Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again! She might speak now, or later, or... I don't know! But speak she will!"
3090,I don't really have anything against her - not her fault that her husband Torygg was bought and paid for by the Empire.
3094,I love when you spin that yarn. Gets better every time you add something new.
3097,You'd better have a damned good reason for being here...
3098,"I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands."
3101,Not now.
3104,"To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff."
3111,Mara only helps those who can afford her tithes. This is nonsense.
3113,"Actually, I admire how you handled the situation."
3114,"Ah, dangerous..."
3119,Ayarg garag gar!
3120,All the living shall fear the dead!
3122,Leave me alone. Can't an old man have some peace?
3124,"Right, then..."
3125,Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef - it only makes sense.
3127,I hope your stay in Markarth treats you better.
3131,It shouldn't have been like this.
3135,"Your Thu'um is strong, Dovahkiin. But not strong enough!"
3139,"Yamarz refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need."
3141,It started out innocent enough; he kept claiming the shipments were light because of Imperial interference.
3143,Did you know there are some fruits that actually grow better in the cold weather?
3144,"Pay no attention to him. A ponderous windbag, like most Imperial generals."
3157,"You look like maybe you need a new weapon. Something big, perhaps? An axe maybe? Or a greatsword?"
3158,"We're going to take out their sentry, then sneak into their camp and ambush them."
3161,Mir...Tah!
3166,Ours is the only family left that truly cares what happens to Winterhold.
3168,Somethin' ya need? Anything for the guild.
3169,"Once his corpse lays cold upon the ground, and all trace of his followers erased, retrieve my Ebony Mail. A gift fit only for my true champion."
3174,"So, are you working with them? You think you can take me? You so much as touch me, and you're going to lose fingers."
3178,"Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief."
3180,One group has hidden out in Whiterun.
3184,"Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you..."
3188,Someone put an arrow in that damn wizard!
3189,The shrine of Namira is further inside. Keep going.
3192,You think this is personal?
3193,Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.
3197,You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.
3198,Wait a moment... do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble thief?
3199,Figures -- I doubt you have sufficient knowledge to harm the Phial even if you wanted to.
3200,Now it is in your hands. Let us work wonders together...
3204,"Are you kidding me? Ever since the Guild's luck turned sour, we haven't had a coin to our name."
3207,I don't know. He never told me.
3208,She's dead. Laelette is dead.
3210,I never miss a good meal.
3213,Thank you again. I can't believe I was this close to being killed.
3214,"I'm composing a new song. A ballad, for Camilla Valerius."
3218,"No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks."
3219,"Here's the big picture. He helped Alduin enslave our ancestors. He may have betrayed Alduin in the end, but that makes him worse, not better."
3223,"If you're going after those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town."
3225,"I'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation."
3229,Fool! He is perverting my Light. 
3231,That priest of Mara who came here before you says the Divines will cure us.
3233,"If you're really Dragonborn, they'll want to talk to you. In the old stories, they always summon the Dragonborn for training."
3234,"If not for Paarthurnax, Alduin could not have been overthrown. It was he that first taught men to use the Thu'um."
3238,"You - over here, quick. Before any of them show up!"
3239,Thank you. I'd almost given up hope.
3240,"Yes, madam. I know I have a lot to work on."
3244,"Just keep at it, or Mulush will beat you."
3246,"Good, you're here. Look, in Ivarstead, there's this Beautiful Barbarian. I need her dead. Don't ask why. Just do it. This gold should cover it."
3248,Some say the swamp took her. Part of me wishes it were that simple.
3250,...
3252,"Enough games, face your death!"
3253,"I told you, it's the wedding of Vittoria Vici, an extremely well connected merchant with the East Empire Company. The Emperor's cousin? Remember?"
3254,"If you have anything you're having a hard time selling, I can take it off your hands."
3255,Attack me again and I'll hunt you down!
3258,"Actually, yes Arch-Mage. I believe there is."
3261,"Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks. But what of the fool? Is Cicero dead?"
3264,"The Empire may try to reclaim Skyrim, and I need everyone ready for that. Though the biggest threat, of course, is the elves."
3265,"Hear my Thu'um! Feel it in your bones. Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!"
3273,"To Oblivion and back, as they say."
3277,Agh... so bored! Only one fight in the last few weeks? This is gonna' drive me crazy.
3280,"Louder than the roar of the Mane, that is!"
3283,"We've made you a fair offer. If you're really serious about this truce, you need to reconsider."
3289,"Ah, steel plate. Now that's a solid choice of armor."
3292,"Arngeir. Rok los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rok fen tinvaak Paarthurnax."
3294,"I still think my boy should have had a traditional Nord wedding. Outside, in the cool mountain air. "
3295,"You're married, yes? To that young metal worker?"
3296,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
3297,"I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane."
3304,"I'm not building a ship, sir. I'm trying to make things grow."
3306,"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Write of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
3315,Your trickery won't confuse me!
3316,"You're going with me, and you're going to make sure I don't have any trouble reaching that giant."
3318,I'm just running some errands for the old man... Err... For myself. I'm just running some errands for myself...
3321,You here to attack me? I'm ready for you this time.
3322,"You look like you could do with a ripe apple. Or a tomato, cabbage or leek?"
3325,Where else would I go? Dawnstar is my home and working here is my job.
3327,"Since you went so far as seek out the Augur for advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic."
3328,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
3330,I don't want to settle. I like things the way they are.
3332,Time to prepare some more records on the silver trade.
3333,"Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history."
3335,Still standing here.
3340,But papa was going to take me hunting tomorrow!
3341,You can't get away from me!
3346,Good! Let's go find something to fight.
3355,"Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?"
3357,Gods above! Look at that!
3359,"The prisoners are in rare form, as usual."
3361,Worse. The loss of shipments from Forsworn attacks are really hitting us hard.
3366,Then it's settled. You and me.
3370,"Beware, beware, the Dragonborn comes."
3372,"Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you saved a group of urchins, to boot. "
3374,"I worship Peryite, yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease."
3382,I do... I do indeed.
3384,"But in time, I made the right friends and proved myself useful enough that they don't give me trouble anymore. "
3387,Rexus. The items.
3389,What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.
3390,"Once that infernal lockbox is opened, he will have exhausted his usefulness to me. "
3395,Plenty of iron to dig.
3397,What?
3398,"He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to find it in the past has been unsuccessful."
3400,"Sorry, a girl can't be too careful out here."
3402,"Well, I need someone I can practice a few spells on. Nothing dangerous, really. Would you be willing to assist me?"
3403,Bye!
3406,Did you hear me?
3410,Who knows what powers the elixir will unlock!
3411,That it was black and gross and nobody wanted to live there anymore.
3416,Let's hear it.
3424,"Leave, outlander."
3428,I don't like you... I think you're a heretic.
3431,"Now, if you're going to get those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town."
3434,Now that was a punch.
3435,"Then I guess that's your last request, fool!"
3443,"That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy..."
3444,"Of course. How are you in a battle, girl?"
3445,Time to end this little game!
3448,You need to learn some manners!
3455,"I actually owned a shop in Vivec City long ago, but I had to leave all that behind when the Red Mountain erupted."
3458,The only thing that matters to me is keeping my wife safe. I won't let anyone harm her.
3460, 
3461,I consider this conversation over.
3464,How's the mine today?
3465,"Brynjolf, huh? Lemme guess. He plucked you off the street and dropped you into the thick of things without tellin' you which way is up. Am I right?"
3466,A good friend of mine was infected by a vampire long ago. He killed himself rather than change into one of those... things.
3469,"The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise."
3470,"Good. All will be revealed in time. Keep playing your part, and Azura will reward you."
3471,It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Owww...
3473,"You again. Guess you need another lesson, huh?"
3482,A sad time.
3484,We have the utmost confidence in you and Ulfric's guiding hands.
3488,"I have things I should see to, but go ahead."
3489,Why? You think it's funny or something?
3491,"Die, damn you!"
3495,You have come! You have come to hear the word of Talos!
3498,No? Do you care about rotting away for a month in a cell?
3500,"This metal will serve the forge well, my brother."
3504,The kind of things that even the College won't tolerate. Things that can get a wizard exiled for life.
3505,"Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?"
3515,"Never said that. Just that we don't get many of you wanting to join, that's all."
3517,The dark elves are uneasy. There's a killer on the streets. And Viola Giordano won't leave me alone.
3524,What kind of talk is this? The man I married would never speak of leaving his home.
3534,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
3538,I can't believe the mess Kleppr left things in. I have twice the work with him gone.
3539,"So cold, so hungry, so tired."
3541,"I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it."
3543,We need to move faster. Keep them off balance.
3545,"The Gildergreen, yes. It's a bit of an eyesore at the moment. More of a problem for the pilgrims than for me, but not many of them around anymore."
3546,"I hear you're in for life. Sad. I'd get a shiv if I was you, or maybe some Skooma to drown your troubles."
3548,"Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there."
3550,"I hope life's treating you well, friend."
3559,The gate's unlocked. You can head inside when you're ready.
3563,"Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early to be getting excited. Still, this is most encouraging."
3564,"Oh, this is not going to end well..."
3566,Crime is at an all-time high in this city thanks to the Thieves Guild. Don't we have enough problems with the war going on?
3569,Should have known you'd be a cheap one.
3570,I avoid going to Eastmarch if I can. Something in the air... I think it's just too close to the border.
3572,Come to purchase ebony? Our Gloombound Mine runs thick with black veins. 
3575,Pleasure doin' business with you.
3579,"When Gallus took one look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold."
3580,Oh.
3583,"No, I haven't. Don't tell me you've lost it."
3584,"As you wish, sir."
3586,Again with the mead!
3588,"She watched while we ate it, and when she saw how much we loved it, she was... so proud..."
3589,"You're different from what I expected, Dragonborn. You treat us with respect, despite your known Imperial sympathies."
3596,Bring it to me straight away when you find it. Don't dally. I can keep it safe.
3600,"I assume you saw the Gildergreen? Big tree, all burnt up, in the middle of the Wind District."
3601,Good. I have some things that need doing.
3602,What do you want... cat?
3603,I know you thought we weren't losing much when you gave it to the enemy. But I'm wasting troops guarding the border that belong on the front lines.
3604,Are you hurt? What's happened?
3608,"Take pity, lady, and spare me a few septims."
3609,"All right, all right, let's not get too hasty now."
3610,Thank you for this. I have a great deal of work ahead of me.
3611,"Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice."
3614,I sure hope there's a way out somewhere down here.
3616,"Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit."
3619,Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.
3620,"The secret is my forge. It consumes fire salts, a strange mineral that burns as hot as Red Mountain lava."
3623,You'll pay those rumors no heed if you wish to retain your welcome in this city.
3626,"They are popular with the nobility there, yes. This particular bracelet is a copy of one worn by a Crown Princess."
3628,I have never been without Azura's foresight since escaping Morrowind. I don't know what to do.
3630,"No. You can use the North Gate, or you can head to the next city."
3636,Even the dead need company. That's what Arkay provides.
3640,At the end of the day you'll find all we care about down here is how much gold you can make us.
3641,"May your next fight bring you victory, friend."
3643,"With open arms, with cheers and song, with joy in my heart and tears in my eyes!"
3645,"You know, I'm beginning to respect you. Other than Aerin, you seem to be the only other person I've met I might be able to trust."
3649,"Hjerim? Well, I'm not sure what you think you'll find there, but you're welcome to have a look. "
3656,Ha! I've suffered worse during training!
3657,Come with us. We need to get out of here.
3658,"Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control. "
3662,"Sorry Mercer, they no longer wish to be involved in our operation."
3664,Lead on.
3665,"A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be."
3666,"And to prove my... sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You lead this Family now. I give you the Blade of Woe, so that you can see it through."
3671,What's going on? And who's this?
3672,(Deep exhale)
3676,Maul? Yeah. That jerk works for Maven Black-Briar now. Left me down here watching this garbage heap.
3677,"We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt."
3678,Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath. 
3683,"You leave me no choice, citizen."
3686,"Ooh, now that one must have hurt!"
3689,"Back to work, I guess. There's never a shortage of dung to shovel around here."
3690,"I don't know if the war is Arkay's will or man's, but it's none of my doings."
3692,Came here to start a lumber mill. Who knew the Nords cared about a bunch of old trees?
3693,"So, the same then."
3697,"These caves... they harbor ill omens, I can sense it."
3701,Alduin mahlaan
3706,You deal with powerful forces. Take care they do not overwhelm you.
3708,Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it.
3709,Take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.
3713,"Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up."
3715,Guards are useless. They just stand around waiting for a full regiment to come and help.
3718,"This hasn't happened in ... centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!"
3728,"So, did you still need my assistance?"
3730,"Yes, milady. Sorry, milday. They will be completed."
3734,Have you no thought beyond the blooding of your blade?
3736,Take that!
3741,"Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or coin, but perhaps I can offer you something better... companionship."
3743,I understand if you need some time to prepare. Let me know when you're ready.
3747,"Your payment, as per the usual."
3748,"Bolli is a good man, he pays us well and watches out for us."
3749,This is my realm now. I've sacrificed too much to let you take it from me!
3752,I plan to spend all the days I got left on the water. It's where I belong.
3757,I assure you that I shall be watching you -- all of you -- very closely.
3763,"What can I getcha, Alva?"
3764,"An ornament, solid gold. In the shape of a dragon's claw."
3765,"Skyrim is well known to be full of these... Draugr, ancient Nord warriors who cannot find peace."
3766,Oho! I thought you'd never figure it out.
3768, 
3769,"Excellent. Now, you must come with me. You've become a part of this. You must be present for the ritual."
3770,Margret!
3772,"I'm sorry, but the children aren't up for adoption right now. You should go."
3776,"War of mine? It's not my war, Seren!"
3778,"Nice. Here, this is what you'll need to know."
3779,What are you doing here? You're supposed to be meeting Malborn in Solitude.
3780,"I know you, Ulfric. If I hand over Markarth, you'll be ready with a new demand."
3782,What if I told you about a large shipment of silver and weapons?
3784,"You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum."
3786,Your new piece will enhance your skill beyond that of the original. Trust me.
3787,"If it wasn't for Aerin, the young man who saved my life, I think I'd already have given up long ago."
3795,"Pay attention, you could learn something."
3799,One of the guards dropped this key while I hid. I wager it will come in handy for you. Please hurry!
3802,This is what happens to you when you speak your mind in this city.
3803,"Show us, Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice."
3811,Of course. Let's go.
3813,"If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!"
3816,"Oooh, wonderful! I can't wait!"
3820,"Good. I can always count on you, can't I?"
3824,"If not for the war, we might have enough guards in the hold to protect the settlements. That the dragons should return now is most unfortunate."
3825,I was hoping you'd say that.
3828,"Whatever you're about to say, don't bother. I don't want to hear it."
3829,"They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people."
3833,"I don't know what it's doing up there, but I'm not waiting around to find out!"
3839,"Just one. I know when I was found by my Argonian father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni."
3840,Let's see if we can find a way out of here.
3841,You have a visitor.
3847,But I forget myself. Krosis. So los mid fahdon. Melancholy is an easy trap for a dovah to fall into.
3850,Ayarg garag gar!
3852,"My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed."
3856,Now I'm here to study Conjuration. That's what's important.
3857,"Phinis is one of the best Conjurers in all of Skyrim, and can help with spells from that school."
3862,"If you have any jewelry to sell, I'd be glad to pay you a fair sum in gold for it."
3863,This far? We're livin' in a sewer. You said we'd have a house as big as the Black-Briars' by now.
3866,"If you brought that Kel, that Elder Scroll back here... to the Tiid-Ahraan, the Time-Wound..."
3869,"Are you my gallant hero? Have you come to whisk me away, to a life of adventure and romance?"
3873,Maramal's been helping me through a rough patch. I just wanted to pay him back. It's not like he's keeping it!
3874,"I don't suppose they want the world to end any more than we do. Or at least, they'd prefer to end it on their terms."
3875,You can trample us underfoot but we will rise again!
3876,I don't have time for this nonsense.
3880,"As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle."
3881,"She's a traveler, from the Imperial City. Came by every day looking for jewelry for her relatives back home."
3882,Vegetables are the food of the Divines.
3885,"He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came."
3887,Why can't he just leave us alone?
3888,We're not done here.
3891,Hey there! I was wondering if I'd run into you out here.
3892,Vah...Koor!
3893,Get moving. I'll see if I can't delay any patrols out there.
3899,"I'm going to stay a while. Rest among these bones. This creature honored us with its life, and I will honor it with my respect."
3900,"Hold on, there. I suppose, in the uh, interest of research... I can spare a few more coins. Double and a half its value. That's all I can muster."
3904,"Name is Stig Salt-Plank, one of the captains of the Blood Horkers."
3908,"It's okay, now. You've found a friend who understands you. You can let go of your guilt."
3909,What do you want with us?
3911,"If you don't mind digging, I own the Quicksilver Mine. It's a better life than working in that damned Iron-Breaker Mine with all those milk drinkers."
3914,It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.
3917,Draugr are below. Foul tasting.
3919,"The forge is strong and so is our chief, Larak. I'm content."
3920,"These are trying times for us all, I know. Many come to the Temple of Kynareth to pray, and I assist them as best I'm able."
3921,Don't let her get away with this!
3922,I don't want to die. I can't die here!
3923,Yield to me!
3924,You have what you came for. Now leave.
3926,Hello? Who's there?
3927,You. Every time I look at you my blood boils.
3928,"It may not be ""official"", but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on."
3930,"Good. And remember - keep the gods, and they'll keep you."
3932,"It's only a bit of fun. You're a lovely young thing, you should try it sometime."
3939,Yyyyyyyaaaaaahhhhhhh!
3941,"Come see me in Windhelm when all this is over, and I'll find a place for you."
3942,"I'm tired, I haven't slept well in weeks."
3946,It's the least I can do for your help in putting this matter to rest.
3951,"Pardon me, milady. Would you care to hear me play my lute?"
3952,I know! I know! I received the news not moments ago! Ha ha! This is glorious!
3956,"In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and everything within when the need arises."
3959,He used the Thu'um. Shouted those Forsworn from the walls. Then he led a band of Nord warriors in to take the city.
3963,"If they were easy to kill, don't you think we would have done it years ago? If our men aren't out in a few minutes, they're dead, trust me."
3970,I can provide you with help for her minions though.  This should help you deal with the Catacombs themselves. 
3972,<Laughter>
3973,"More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last two contracts I gave you. Let's get those done, hmm?"
3974,"Go, take care of the Muiri contract. There will be plenty more, I promise you."
3975,"Allow me to give you this, the fork I used the first time I tasted one of your dishes. Oh, and these ingredients I've been collecting for you."
3976,Dress yourself.
3983,No. Even Ranmir can only drink so much.
3989,"He comes by to perform Boethiah's insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing. Captured and bound. Left to rot."
3991,"The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that coming, did you?"
3997,This is simply fascinating.
3998,"Now, to prove yourself to me, I have a task for you. Take my axe, and deliver it to the Jarl of Whiterun."
4000,By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing... it worked.
4008,"Never heard of anybody like that. But if you want to hide out in Riften, the Ratway's where you'd be."
4009,You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with Nocturnal.
4011,"You have my thanks, friend."
4013,You had best tell the Jarl in Whiterun. He needs to know about this.
4016,I'm glad it was you and not me.
4020,You wear the armor of a brigand. Best not cause any trouble on my watch.
4022,"Oh she will, mark my words. And don't you let her."
4023,"We've all seen your little weapon. We're impressed. Now, please put it away."
4024,Far have I traveled to bring you these fine goods. Come and see what I offer.
4026,"Don't you worry Rhiada. If any Forsworn coming knocking on our door, Nana will let you know...."
4027,Why are you doing that?
4030,"That is precisely why we remain neutral. Ours is to tell tales of empires, not to make or break them."
4032,"Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is that you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored."
4036,"Nonsense. Is a child who learns to read ""not a scholar"" of literature? Is a smith's apprentice ""not a scholar"" of blacksmithing?"
4038,Be careful up there.
4042,"I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true. "
4050,"Well, let's see... travel-stained clothes, worn soles, blank and unintelligent expression... Yes, in fact you do."
4053,Fenrig! You're alive!
4054,Thank you.
4055,I'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard.
4056,I'm not going to ask again.
4060,Here you are.
4062,Come on! We need to get inside before that dragon comes back!
4065,"Think I'll forge me a new sword, just in case things go awry here in Solitude. I'm the blacksmith's apprentice, you see."
4066,There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe. 
4067,"No, but his housecarl sent us a letter. "
4068,I'm still here.
4070,"Of course you can buy me a drink... you didn't need to say a word, but I heard you loud and clear."
4072,He would dote on her so much. Let her work the forge and everything. I miss him so.
4073,"Sure, it tastes great. Only one problem. You said it can make the darkness as clear as day when you drink it. Guess what? It doesn't."
4074,You could have asked before just taking it.
4077,"That weapon breaks my wares, we're gonna have us a real problem..."
4078,"Welcome back to the temple, messenger."
4079,"Synda... you left your dagger behind again yesterday. I told you, the road isn't safe."
4083,Just go away!
4084,What did you tell him? Why did you do this to me?
4085,Splendid! I've been looking for a new investor. Now it seems my search is over.
4086,Better get used to it. Snows most all the time in Windhelm.
4087,"So I like to have a little fun, so what?"
4090,"You know, I don't get the impression that I'm very well liked at the College..."
4091,"I promise you, all your questions will be answered. You just have to trust me."
4096,"He takes after his father, and she takes after you."
4097,You gonna stare all day or buy some armor?
4098,"The roads of Skyrim can be treacherous. If you must walk them, be wary."
4101,"My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
4102,Just think. We're the first to set foot here in thousands of years.
4103,"I assume they were after her valuables... she always wore far too much jewelry in public. When I told her it'd be the death of her, I never thought..."
4105,"You're talking to a killer, remember that."
4106,"Never mind, it doesn't matter. You need to leave. Now."
4109,Fair enough.
4112,"They are called the Forgemaster's Fingers. Bring them to our chief, and he will decide if you're worthy to be Blood-Kin to the Orcs."
4114,They squander their father's love. We can't dally this time. 
4115,Ah! It burns!
4116,It would seem you're not the accomplished pickpocket you think you are...
4118,"Yes, mother."
4119,You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.
4120,Always something going wrong. Mill needs more lumber or the saw needs sharpening.
4121,"You aren't angry about it, right?"
4122,"You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible."
4124,"Step into the light, and your test begins."
4127,I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.
4130,I have work to do.
4133,"Well, what is it you want?"
4134,"Go on, get moving! I'll try and clear a path for you."
4136,"Oh don't pretend to be modest. I'm talking about your new role as champion. Apparently, you've taken my people under your wing."
4139,"Up for a little hunting? My husband is being a sad stick, so I can't go myself."
4144,"Then there's Ingun Black-Briar. Bright young thing and a worthy apprentice, when she isn't wasting my rare ingredients."
4149,Thank you.
4156,"In truth, I do not. I have always dreamed of seeing new lands, and it does not hurt that we are making a good profit."
4157,"Mmm, yes... Brelas, is that the one? I hope you're not thinking of cutting me out, are you? Haha."
4158,Who would have thought I would be getting married?
4159,Something as specific and ancient as the Staff of Magnus... I'm not sure we'd ever find something like that...
4160,I lost my eye defending the Empire... Spare some grub for a veteran?
4161,"He surrendered pretty meekly, too. So much for his death-or-glory reputation."
4165,What are you on about? Let's just get the treasure here and go.
4167,Just take this damn thing. I never want to see it again.
4169,Your own fate will be your own choice. Just as always.
4172,"Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word."
4177,"I hope the hunting goes well, sister. We've got the cowards on their heels now."
4180,"I'll watch for Mercer, just get the information we need."
4181,You're right. Malacath teaches us to meet our fate. Perhaps this is mine.
4182,Alduin mahlaan
4189,"Eventually, the Star will fade back into my realm in Oblivion, but I doubt you have the hundred or so years it would take to wait."
4192,Perhaps it's actually a sign of their love for you. They don't want to see you with unworthy mates.
4196,The only way to get that special job is by doin' smaller ones in those cities until we catch their ear... then they'll contact me and we're off.
4197,"I inherited the ship when my mother passed away. She spent her life on the water, and now I do, too."
4207,I sell my catch across a good portion of Skyrim... it's worth its weight in gold to me.
4208,Let me speak to our guest.
4210,Isn't there some business you should be tending to?
4214,"Hmph. ""Solitude."" Lonely Cicero could tell you a thing or two about solitude..."
4216,Turn me in? For what? What crime's been committed? I'm just making idle talk about what would most undoubtedly be a tragic event...
4217,How nice to meet you.
4220,I think Illdi's better than Dean Pantea actually knows. She just gets intimidated when she's in class and can't sing.
4222,You can't catch me!
4223,"So, unless you wish a visit from one of their own, I'd suggest you follow your own advice and keep your mouth shut."
4224,Thanks again for the ice wraith teeth.
4229,"Fall to me, dragon!"
4230,"Tools, wares and weapons, all for sale at fair prices."
4233,This is the best news I've ever gotten!
4234,"I've been to Ivarstead a few times, but never climbed High Hrothgar. I wouldn't mind visiting the monastery at the summit."
4238,Lately I've had my hands full suppressing these ridiculous accusations of corruption in the keep.
4239,"Boy, did you miss all the excitement."
4240,They took his shield to those Hagraven beasts they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs.
4243,"So, if you've got the nerve, I've got plenty of extra jobs to help get the Guild back on its feet."
4245,"You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders."
4247,Let's see those Stormcloaks try to break into this canyon.
4249,"It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic."
4250,"I may be old, but I can show 'em a trick or two."
4251,There you are!
4255,A very powerful family in Windhelm.
4256,By all accounts the Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see the sense of a truce under these conditions.
4258,Remember... hit the one in the middle!
4264,"He hired the others and paid for my goods. I am allowed to run the caravan, but I pay Ri'saad a percentage of my profits."
4271,"And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. "
4272,"Depends on what you mean by ""busy."" I'm also the head jailor in the dungeon here. Quiet job, usually."
4273,"Well, well. Aren't we the overachiever. Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances..."
4274,"The Black-Briars have Riften in their pocket and the Thieves Guild watchin' their back, so keep your nose out of their business."
4277,I'll let you live. This time.
4279,I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading.
4282,"Did you see a hound on the road? A fine, strong creature that's been wandering near town."
4285,I hope someone knows where we're going.
4291,There are forts like this all over Skyrim. The Imperials abandoned most of them a long time ago.
4292,"He said he'd even gone to Riften to try and find the bastard. I think maybe he was hoping they'd just kill him, and that'd be the end of it."
4294,"My loss, right?"
4296,Apologies accepted. I understand how this entire story can be mistaken for fiction since the circumstances are so abstract.
4297,My mother is the Priestess of Talos. She tends to the shrine and teaches his ways. I'm just not so sure she's delivering the right message.
4302,"Lead on, Listener."
4303,"It usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father."
4304,"Until you're done with Vex, we don't have anything to discuss."
4309,"You don't prepare the meat with any of those strange Elven spices, do you?"
4311,"Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally."
4316,"My husband, Gunnar, died about five years ago. Forsworn attack. I miss that stubborn oaf."
4318,"I told you, it's from my family."
4319,Have fun!
4326,Hjaalmarch would allow us to directly threaten the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...
4327,"I have some things that belonged to my daughter, Friga. She... she won't be needing them any more."
4336,"I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us."
4340,"Yeah, walk away like a good doggie. Just stay out of the Black-Briars' business and maybe we'll give you a bone."
4343,You can sell off that junk at Bits and Pieces.
4344,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
4347,"Is that wise, sir?"
4349,"You've done well, hunter."
4350,At least Narfi has Reyda's Necklace... reminds Narfi of his sister. Thank you for giving this to Narfi.
4351,"Actually, the fisherman who found me, the man I call my father gave it to me."
4356,Damn. Another body to get rid of.
4359,"Tell you what. Go ahead and deal with your business for now. When you're done, find me and we'll deal with mine."
4365,"I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and use it to gain a measure of her ""cooperation."""
4366,"Odahviing will come to your challenge. Boziik. Krilot. He will not be able to resist your call, from the Hill of the Dovah itself... he will come."
4371,Arnleif and Sons Trading Company buys and sells anything you wandering types need.
4374,"Give me your sword, Hjalti. That we may become brothers as you promised."
4375,"Oh, very brisk. When the snow sets in, even the hardiest Nord needs some spiced wine to warm the blood."
4384,Perhaps we would have dragon allies against Alduin if the ancient Blades had not acted so arrogantly.
4386,"Oh! That's right! Pelagius! Yes, yes, now I recall. Well done, well done."
4396,"I've been watching the way you mine and I have to say, I'm very impressed."
4397,"Hemming, I want you to personally supervise the next shipment."
4398,I could have sworn I heard something right behind us.
4399,Thanks!
4401,Hadvar? What are you doing here? Are you on leave from...
4403,But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age.
4408,Aren't you supposed to be in Markarth? Finish that job and we'll talk about more.
4413,"If that's what you want. Watch your back out there, and if you need me again, you know where I'll be."
4414,"Putting aside Ralston's Constant of Universal Inversion for a moment, how would you approach the problem?"
4422,"If you're here for the College, don't let the folks in town bother you. Just try and keep to yourself."
4424,Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?
4425,"Your doom has come, damned worm!"
4426,"You'd better. Because until you do, you don't get a single coin from us... and you won't be able to use our fences."
4427,Finding Mara was the greatest moment of my life. I'll never forget the warmth that spread through my heart when we embraced.
4429,What? Your heroic tale of locking yourself in the Ratway for years isn't enough?
4432,"Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right?"
4435,So nice to have pleasant company for a change.
4437,When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?
4438,"Go on, leave me alone..."
4445,My place is chief and my challenge is to lead my people.
4446,"""...for it bears aloft next summer's seeds."" That's my boy."
4447,Genuine Falmerblood Elixir for sale! Live for thousands of years... see into other people's thoughts!
4448,Are you asleep?
4449,"Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return."
4452,I misspoke. Never mind what I said. Now get back to work.
4455,I need to get back to Solitude and let them know what's happened.
4459,It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways.
4460,Get over to Whiterun.
4464,"Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen! It wasn't my fault, I swear!"
4467,Maven wants to see you right away. I suggest you head right over.
4468,"Yes, but I must stay here and wait for the day when I'll be married and sent to another stronghold."
4469,It shall be so.
4470,Fine. Please accept this token of gratitude.
4473,"Before I let you into Riften, you need to pay the visitor's tax."
4485,Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder. 
4487,"Oblivion has been watching you since the day you were conceived, mortal. Do not think that your life has been served by your will alone."
4489,"Thinks his ballads and sonnets are going to convince Camilla Valerius to marry him. As if she would say ""yes."""
4497,"I'm walking the 7,000 Steps to honor the Greybeards and reflect on my own life. It's a tradition among the Nords of Skyrim."
4498,This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations.
4499,"We hid from our past for years, became tradesman, people of coin and influence."
4507,Here. I want you to have this.
4508,Eldergleam's sanctuary grove is to the east of here.
4510,"Mighty Arkay, God of Mortals, hear now the prayers of your humble servant. Bless these departed souls and welcome them into the realms beyond."
4511,My brother Jon had the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war. Too bad he died before he had the chance.
4512,I can't get a bead on him!
4513,Here to mine?
4515,"This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind."
4516,"Hey friend, you wouldn't happen to be looking for unusual items would you?"
4519,I know of one. Forgotten. Sequestered.
4524,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
4526,"We've got something of a love triangle here in Riverwood. Faendal and Sven, both vying for Camilla's affections."
4538,But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for that. Could they?
4539,And what would you have me do?
4540,"Yes, well... That's all we ask of you. Carry on."
4543,I have herbs to mix.
4546,You're asking for trouble walking around with dangerous magic like that.
4547,"Yes, wouldn't want to miss the lush summer we have ahead. "
4548,All right. That should do it. I think I'm ready to try the College again. Thanks!
4550,You need to bloody well get your priorities straight if you want to make it around here.
4552,"I told everyone he died during questioning, and I need you to track him down and make sure he doesn't show up to disprove that."
4555,"Welcome, child of Malacath. Your kin bid you welcome to our stronghold."
4559,Wise decision. The vaults in the Hall of the Vigilant will guard this against future temptation.
4560,"We have had a vision of the next Sybil, living in a village to the north. She must be brought to the temple for her reverie to begin."
4561,Maybe one of the guards had a key?
4562,"Ah, Berit's ashes. He was a good man. Not many warriors grow to a fine, old age."
4567,We're still growin' by leaps and bounds thanks to you. Another merchant's just moved into the space outside the Flagon.
4570,"Work hard, now! The pride of Iron-Breaker Mine is on the line."
4572,Nord... dog!
4573,"Long ago, there lived a mighty hero of the Nords. Olaf One-Eye. Olaf did battle with a fearsome dragon named Numinex."
4579,"Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations."
4580,"Great. Watch yourself out there, boss."
4585,"Need anything else, just let me know."
4592,"Ah yes, their trickery."
4597,We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
4599,Brynjolf sent you to rub it in?
4600,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
4602,"Long as I stay out of the way, the guards don't seem to care about me being here."
4603,Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.
4606,"Thanks to Ulfric's rebellion, countless innocent people can't feed or clothe their families. It's unacceptably tragic."
4607,"The world's going mad, and our Jarl doesn't care. She's only in it for herself."
4609,"First, an incantation to remove the barrier."
4610,Take that thing down!
4616,"But around here, there's a tremendous amount of work to get done, not to mention the dangers she's not ready to face."
4620,There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time.
4625,You! Don't hurt me! Not again!
4626,I'm hearing good things about you from Brynjolf.
4628,Just wait. Just... I can fix this.
4630,"Thanks to you, I've just been issued a challenge in front of my whole tribe, by a Daedric Prince, no less. I can't ignore that."
4631,"Oh dear, whatever is a girl to do with such fearful brutes about her?"
4632,"I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here."
4634,You learn quickly. Once more.
4636,I got one last special request of you. Finish this one and all of Skyrim's ours for the takin'.
4639,Namira covets your ugliness.
4641,"Well met. I don't think they're hiring anyone at the moment, so if you're looking for work, you're out of luck."
4642,"We don't all lead your life of grand adventure, Harbinger."
4643,"We've got honor. Wealth and titles, too. Aye, and buxom women to warm your bed on a cold Skyrim night."
4645,I can't think of anyone better suited to return the Key. Just remember to keep your eyes open and walk true with the shadows.
4646,"Bye now, dearie."
4651,Good riddance.
4655,"Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?"
4656,It stands ready to meet the blood of her foes.
4657,Where do you think you'll be the most help - scouting ahead or supporting the rest of my men?
4660,See into other people's thoughts!
4661,Namira grants us victory.
4664,Nothing like free labor to make operating costs cheaper.
4665,"Ah, indeed? There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think..."
4667,May the light of certitude guide your efforts.
4668,"The air is so clear in Skyrim, one can see forever."
4671,Hmph. That remains to be seen.
4672,"Certainly, acolyte. What troubles you?"
4673,Your kindness will never be forgotten.
4675,Hard to believe people actually have to work in places like this.
4678,What are we waiting for?
4679,I can take you to any of the hold capitals.
4684,"She was the toughest of the bunch. Honestly, I'm amazed she didn't kick you out of the Bee and Barb herself."
4685,"They can defile our shrine, they can arrest our people and they can silence our voices, but the Empire will never destroy our spirit."
4688,"You didn't touch it did you? Well no, of course you must have! Did you attempt to wield it? And you're not dead?"
4692,We're almost through!
4700,I wouldn't go out there for all the money in the world.
4702,"We haven't been expecting you, and the old man needs his rest. Come back some other time."
4705,My camp is nearby in the ruins of Nilheim. Get me there safely and you'll be rewarded.
4707,He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Be careful. You're not the only one looking for him.
4710,"Falion had his work to keep him busy, and I needed somethin' to do. So, here I am."
4711,"You found me! Laelette was trying to find me too, but I'm glad you found me first."
4712,Lucan's got a little bit of everything at the Riverwood Trader.
4713,"You still need to prove yourself, whelp. "
4716,"Well, my friend, you did not know Ysgramor."
4718,"I'm just here to provide protection for his eminence's cousin. Please, enjoy yourself."
4722,Excellent work. I knew you'd bring back something useful.
4727,"Alduin will hide in this lightless mist until we Shout together, and shatter his power."
4739,This what you want? Huh?
4741,So you're the one that burned down Goldenglow Estate.
4742,"If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift."
4745,"Greetings, Listener!"
4748,I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.
4754,"It's not wise to discuss it here. Please, if you truly wish to help, meet me at my home. I'll tell you the whole story."
4757,Never should have come here...
4768,"You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily."
4775,But you will know him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!
4778,In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara. 
4780,"Perhaps I'll join the Legion one day, as my father had done."
4783,I could swear I've seen you somewhere before...
4785,"If Ulfric had his way, anyone who wasn't a Nord would be shipped right out of Skyrim."
4789,This is one of the signs. The signs that Lady Mara is displeased with your constant inebriation.
4790,And a very ancient one.
4791,It was the Kel - the Elder Scroll. They used it to... cast him adrift on the currents of Time.
4792,"Ah, I see. The old Dark Brotherhood ""silent intimidation"" treatment.  "
4793,Got a pretty full stock of potions and alchemy reagents.
4794,"I would like to personally thank you on behalf of myself and the Thalmor for your assistance. Here, for your work."
4795,"Apprentice blacksmith, at your service."
4797,"You are trying my patience, citizen. Back away. Now."
4799,"So what are you doing here? Lorkhan's eyes, you can't let the Thalmor get to him first! Get back to Riften!"
4808,Oof!
4809,"It's been an honor, guardian."
4812,The Jarl of Whiterun has asked for our help.
4814,Not now.
4815,The Eldergleam has blessed us with a sapling. 
4816,"Was this before or after the Mythic Dawn attacked the Emperor and Valen single-handedly fought them off? Just shut up and drink, Romlyn."
4817,"He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door."
4818,Good luck out there. It seems like a tough time to be wandering Skyrim.
4819,"We manage to break that mare and bring her back here, we can sell her for a small fortune."
4822,I'm not sure if half these potions work. But they should. I think.
4824,"Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?"
4825,Oaf.
4829,Look around. Grab anything that looks useful.
4830,You went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work.
4833,"Look around the room and you'll see what we're up against. Just between you and me, a lot of what Ulfric says about the Empire is true."
4840,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
4846,"You need something talk to my husband. Vantus Loreius. Or just Loreius, if it's all the same to you."
4847,I was a much younger man when I married Katla. Now I can hardly keep up with her.
4852,"Apparently so many people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the client."
4853,"Guess we can't afford to miss that much work, can we? Oh well..."
4856,Outsiders. Pfft.
4860,And you've proven that was the best move I could have made. Don't give me that look. You're free to go.
4861,"I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for this. Move along."
4863,But... I don't yet know how you can stop him. The prophecy doesn't say. But Alduin's Wall does. I hope.
4864,"You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation to this council, despite your known association with the rebels."
4869,Look. One of the ancient Nord ruins. Who knows what's down there?
4870,"Happy? No, I am not happy. Zeymahi lost ont du'ul Bormahu. Alduin was once the crown of our father Akatosh's creation."
4872,"I warned you not to cross Maven. If I hadn't stepped in and paid amends, you'd be... well, I think you know."
4874,"That remains to be seen. But if it is so, and if Boethiah appears, then we will welcome you as one of us."
4875,There's nothing left of Winterhold. Nothing!
4876,What's the matter with you?
4877,Kjeld bothering you again?
4879,"The Forsworn are as wild as wolves. Practice those old magics, so some folk say."
4881,"As restless as ever, sir, but I don't see them taking any kind of incendiary action. Not soon, anyway."
4883,I could learn a lot from the people in this room.
4884,"Gods, you'd better have something good up your sleeve. I've got nothing left."
4885,Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth?
4889,"If Riften can be retaken, I will redouble my efforts to ensure the safety of my subjects and the defense of the Rift."
4890,Haven't you been listening to me? All the old tales agree that he has some means to travel to Sovngarde itself.
4892,Tell me you looked through the trash before you did that.
4893,"Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?"
4896,Now that's what I like to see. Someone who gets things done.
4901,My mother always used to say that too.
4902,"Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should see what we have available."
4907,"I'm sorry Enthir, I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately."
4909,"Ten of them should be enough for me to get a better understanding of how they were crafted. That's all I need, all right?"
4911,"Caught a case of Rockjoint, once. Bothela at the Hag's Cure fixed me right up."
4915,Look out! Don't get too close!
4916,Jouane?
4918,"Yes, yes. What is it?"
4923,I wouldn't complain if we could string together a few sunny days now and then.
4924,The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse.
4928,You've been suspended from the College for what you did. You'd better talk to Tolfdir if you want to get it sorted out.
4930,You should go into town and talk to an elf named Nelacar. He was involved in the whole mess.
4933,Pavo and I had to fight our way out of Kolskeggr. Forsworn killed everyone else.
4935,Nargh!
4938,No. I think he was entirely wrong. Roggvir's execution was justified and necessary.
4941,Absolutely.
4946,"You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous."
4951,"The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed."
4955,Khajiit walks in your footsteps.
4961,"There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home."
4963,"Oh, it's just wonderful being Skald's servant. He's not demanding in the least."
4967,I don't know what he's talking about. He must be seeing things.
4968,"Look, before I have you help track Mercer down I need to know what you learned from Karliah. I mean everything."
4971,I think we need to prepare for the worst. The coffers are dwindling and I can barely keep our contacts happy.
4972,Keep your blade ready.
4974,We understand the Nightgate and Roughwater inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.
4975,"You won't get anything out of me, you filthy sons o' horkers."
4978,"It's through this conduit that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains in return is a complete mystery."
4982,"My title is Harbinger, child. I am no man's master."
4987,"Dear sister, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting."
4991,"The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies."
4992,"Well aren't we the eager one? Sorry to disappoint, but there's nothing. Try me again later."
4993,Let's clear the place out first. Then we'll gather our loot.
4995,"You're a talkative one, aren't you."
5005,Work? I suppose you can call it that. I call it slavery. I work my fingers to the bone keeping this disgusting place clean.
5014,Take home Windhelm's finest and freshest produce today!
5016,Yes. Although I rarely use my training. The Greybeards believe the Voice should be used only for worship of Kynareth.
5017,Thanks for looking after Hrefna.
5019,"I see... and this ""force of habit,"" does it also compel you to murder?"
5024,"I'm told that you're up to something out in the marsh, Falion."
5031,"Crazy old coot, from what I've heard. For that to stand out down here, he must really be off his nut."
5032,You cannot defeat us! The Dragonborn still stands!
5033,Hopefully that answer will satisfy you. Good day.
5042,I swear that woman Aeri doesn't appreciate all the work I do for her damn mill.
5043,My parents dropped me off here a year ago. But they're coming back to get me. They said so.
5044,"I'll put it simply, so you'll understand. I advise the Jarl in matters of magic."
5046,Finally!
5050,One group has hidden out in Haafingar.
5052,"Well, that depends on what you're looking for."
5055,"It's not any of your bother, so I don't see what you're apologizing for."
5057,"I'm telling you, Ulfric's planning an attack on Whiterun."
5059,Good. I'm ready for anything.
5060,"For one thing, I won't empty Falkreath's coffers to buy myself fine clothes an' expensive mead."
5065,"Ha! Well, I certainly do feel that way."
5068,"Papa, mama's making me do kitchen work again."
5070,Try and hit the far target.
5071,Oh my. Been a lot of years since I've seen something like that...
5075,I am not going to let that happen!
5077,"Did you clean the linens, yet?"
5078,"Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications. "
5080,"Finally, reinforcements have arrived."
5082,"Of course, it's a group of wizards they're pointing their fingers at. Who knows what they want it for, but we want it back."
5083,Enough!
5084,"I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker."
5089,"Now here I am, working for this dreary city's Fishery. I sometimes wonder why I don't just move on."
5096,"If you want to awaken from your next slumber, I suggest you leave me be."
5097,Got lots of jobs available. Interested?
5099,"Come, we must get to the Skull and destroy it."
5101,Ahhh... no one will know I'm here now.
5102,Ha!
5103,The spirit of Skjor is with us on this errand. I feel him.
5110,Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.
5115,So can I come?
5117,"We don't fight, son. We, um, talk. Loudly."
5118,That I am. You know how to use one?
5119,So about this axe... 
5122,Ha ha! I love a challenge!
5124,Oh. All right... I guess I'll just keep practicing on my own. Sorry to bother you.
5128,"I am not weak. Very well, outlander, I will go with you whenever you are ready."
5135,For Whiterun! For the Empire!
5138,"No, no, that's not what I'm interested in right now."
5142,"Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power is in our blood. You feel it in yourself, do you not?"
5144,"Viarmo, the college really must take a stand on the war!"
5146,"All for an old crown, huh?"
5148,"If you go in there, you don't come out. Ever."
5150,"That may work for your targets, but you'll find I'm not so easily impressed."
5151,"Thank you, thank you! I promise I'll help. And then I'll go back to the College and I'll beg them to let me back in."
5152,I'll just wait here and make sure nothing foul escapes the catacombs.
5157,Very well. I am poorer for it.
5158,"Let's continue, we still have much to do."
5159,Attention! General Tullius has an announcement!
5160,Here's your gold. Try not to spend it all in one place.
5167,"Good to have you by my side, friend. I need reliable people around."
5169,J'zargo awaits word of how well his scrolls work.
5173,All right men. On me! For the Emperor! For his Legionnaires!
5176,"I said give me some meat. I'm hungry, and the Divines know you don't need more food in that huge gut of yours."
5180,I... I don't have any money.
5181,"You know, there might be gold somewhere in here."
5182,"Excellent. Now we can get back to business. I think it's best we just forget this ever happened and move on, hmm?"
5186, 
5187,"We do what we do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token of such love reciprocated."
5188,What good are fish if you have to eat them alone?
5189,"Cowards, the both of you. My father would not sit idly back and wait while evil men take over his lands. We're done discussing this for now."
5190,"No, it can't be... oh my... and all this time, I was thinking he'd been unfaithful to me. I feel so stupid."
5192,Dibella's blessing to you.
5193,"Voada, you spilled laundry water in the soup pot again! Do I need to cut off your fingers to teach you a lesson?"
5197,Don't let those Stormcloaks get away!
5201,"Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell."
5203,"Ahraan. You wound me, Dovahkiin. I may not tell the whole truth, but I am no liar."
5204,Listener. It is an honor to stand before you.
5210,What do you see from that little cage? Speak.
5211,You're abandoning me? Me? I never want to see you ever again.
5212,Now we need to prepare a grand feast to welcome you to Namira's coven. 
5216,"Remember the passphrase: ""Silence, my brother."""
5217,"There is too much to learn in the world, too much to know, to fight over ""laws"" that have no real purpose."
5218,Not sure you should be walking around naked.
5219,I've looked after her safety for so long... 
5220,"We have a cozy little profit. Here. This is your share, love."
5221,"I heard one of them was just arrested trying to sneak into the city. If he's locked up in the jail, perhaps you can get it out of him."
5225,"What's the point? I'm not very good, and it's only for the same few people every night."
5226,Azura's Star is ours. Ours!
5227,But I also enjoy learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.
5228,He knew everything about the ancient dragonlore of the Blades.
5229,"Azura's wisdom to you, friend."
5230,"Not now, lad. Karliah said it was important."
5231,"Well now, this is unexpected..."
5234,The answer ain't gonna be any different the next time. Arrogant elven bastard.
5235,"I owe you a great deal, Nightingale."
5236,"And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would be sealed. You have a unique way of looking at things, my friend."
5239,"Yes, Dean Inge."
5241,"""An elf that studies stars""? Where did you hear about that?"
5247,Nerevar guide me!
5248,Ancano is doing something with that thing... the Eye. We can't stop him!
5250,"Sure. How about you mind your own business about it, and I won't have to get Dirge to toss you into the cistern?"
5251,What're you going to do after you graduate? I'm thinking of joining the Legion. I hear they're looking for skalds. Just think. Me - a war bard.
5253,"I remember a cutpurse trying to rob me on the road once. When I drew Grimsever, I think the poor man soiled his armor!"
5260,But he hands all the paperwork over to Nepos the Nose to finish. That old man's back is heavy with burden.
5262,Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards... I might be able to help you.
5263,Someday I'm gonna grow up and be the Jarl.
5264,"I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed."
5270,Contacts are springin' up all over and I've got young footpads beatin' down the door to join up.
5272,"Anything that confirms that Thorald isn't dead, but is being held captive. I know those Battle-Borns have it."
5273,"Speak to Beirand, he's normally out by the forge. He'll get you outfitted."
5274,"Should have left when you had the chance, friend. Now we're gonna have to spill your brains on the road here."
5279,I hear you have spirit. This is good. You may yet join our numbers.
5281,"In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim."
5283,Why are they hurting each other?
5286,"Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost... storybook."
5290,"Sure, walk away. I wasn't talking or anything..."
5294,And they call me a savage. Least I don't leave my trash lying around...
5295,"Now, empty your pockets or I'll pick the gold off your corpse."
5297,Thank you.
5299,Beware! The World-Eater waits within the mist!
5300,"None of that matters to me. Until someone takes a Dunmer, I let Windhelm deal with its own problems."
5304,"Out here at work, Hjorunn treats me like an equal. Better than most in town."
5309,"No, and before you ask, it's not for sale."
5310,You must be a Stormcloak through and through to request that one.
5311,"Well it was, up until the point where we set foot outside. The house was surrounded by town guard... the client had ratted us out."
5313,That's right. It isn't.
5314,Yeah yeah...
5319,"She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness."
5323,Farewell.
5329,Are you prepared?
5333,That's it.
5339,Now is not the time for talk...
5341,It's no easy thing to make a living in the wilds of Skyrim.
5344,"Oh, I am so happy for you! My, what a burden to have carried. But you've done it! You've conquered your own inner demons! Bravo! "
5349,These dreams are real I tell you. Real!
5350,As you wish.
5353,Oh! You're a traveler! You must have so much to tell about the world outside this boring town!
5354,Didn't you know?
5356, 
5359,Get your thieving hands off that!
5360,"Delphine really is alive, then? You'd better come in then and tell me how you found me and what you want."
5364,"""The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn."""
5368,"None? Nothing at all? Nothing from the College, even?"
5370,You here for my next interrogation? I got nothing but time...
5371,"There's no need to be rude, Grelka. If you don't care for Argonians, then perhaps you should take residence somewhere else."
5373,"Just need to gather my tools and finish up a couple of things. No worries - I'll see to Cicero, make sure that wagon gets fixed."
5376,"All right, then."
5377,You'd do well to get out of here before I change my mind and have you locked in irons...
5382,"The Empire is fortunate to have the support of the Thalmor during this difficult time, don't you think?"
5385,Hrongar won't give us a straight answer.
5389,He's a lucky man to have such a beautiful young wife.
5391,No need to get hasty. I... I was just testing you. You can go on ahead.
5392,But we never found one. Until now.
5393,No... No! You must be the one who took my skooma!
5398,I don't care much for the war one way or the other.
5400,"Now, I know who you are. And... and I know your business... Just, please... These are good folk we got here. Mostly..."
5401,Hear that?
5404,"A small test, if you will."
5405,Go away.
5406,"Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?"
5407,Time to end your foolish charade!
5409,"Yes, mother."
5411,Do I know you?
5414,"Now, let's just pretend this never happened."
5416,"The Bunkhouse is for the working man, not some sort of a luxury inn for tourists."
5423,That was amazing!
5426,Has the Empire forsaken us? How could Whiterun fall into the hands of these stinking half-wit Nords?
5427,Let me show you where they are. Maybe they welcome you. Maybe they put an arrow in your face. Who knows?
5432,Are you trying? 'Cause I'm not.
5440,"Damn Forsworn. Only a matter of time before they hit here, too."
5442,"He's a fool, if you haven't met him already. Thinks Ulfric Stormcloak is invincible and spits dragon fire."
5445,That was just lying around? Good find.
5447,"Old Delvin certainly takes care of his own, doesn't he."
5448,But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.
5449,Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.
5452,"I am an apprentice wizard, not a pack mule! Oh very well, but make it quick."
5454,"I said no! No adventures, no theatrics, no thief-chasing!"
5456,All you need to do is ask and we can both come out of this smellin' like a rose.
5458,"They live in seclusion near the top of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim."
5464,"Treat my people fairly, and I will do the same to you."
5467,"Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send the poor fool to the Void.  I'll give you the key to this shack, and you'll be on your way.  "
5468,No doubt those Greybeards up at High Hrothgar will talk your ear off about it.
5469,Another poor soul lost.
5470,"I was wondering, father. Maybe you should take a day off and head into town. I could watch the inn while you're away."
5474,Most of the guards in Dawnstar carry swords forged from his very smithy.
5475,"Your arms and legs are fit for catching strong, agile prey. I could use your help."
5476,"I don't know what you're talking about. But if I were you, I'd hold my tongue."
5477,"Keep your eyes open, I don't like the looks of this place."
5480,Even just one should be enough for me to complete my research.
5481,Would you look at that!
5482,"Is the line for my next performance starting already? Come on, don't be shy. Plenty of room for everyone."
5484,"My only worry is her ""Keeper."" I'm not sure what Cicero expects to gain by bringing the Night Mother here, but he'll soon learn this is my Sanctuary."
5487,For the Emperor!
5488,I am one of the Afflicted. I'd have been dead from this plague a year ago if not for Peryite's protection.
5489,"You'll want the Bannered Mare. See Olfina, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead."
5497,"Yes, of course you are right. Still, I would give much for even a few grains of moonsugar."
5499,"Purchase more supplies, then. That's your job as Steward, isn't it? Why do you trouble me with these details?"
5503,"I can't talk about it. Rest assured, the Jarl hears everyone's concerns. You will be able to visit the dead again soon."
5505,"I try and take comfort in knowing that when all is lost, there is much to be gained."
5507,He was once a student here at the College. Now he is... something different.
5511,Can't. Got at least two rounds to go.
5513,"It's you! Please, don't hurt me!"
5514,There are more books to be recovered and secured here in the Arcanaeum.
5516,"Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a plot by the other side..."
5517,I fear this truce will not last. You gave the Empire too much. Ulfric will not let that stand for long.
5518,I can't keep helping you with everything. 
5521,"Secondly, we plan on liberating a settlement from Imperial hands."
5524,Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is as it should be. This is because of you.
5526,Of course.
5532,Get to the nearest way out!
5539,"The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it and to the people... but I've kept a little something to offer you in appreciation."
5544,It will be so.
5546,Were the Greybeards any help? Did they know this anything about the Shout used against Alduin?
5548,"This is enough to make your head spin, eh?"
5549,You've finally become one of us. Come with me. I think it's time I announced my plans to you and your new brothers.
5552,"You are weak. Sooner you realize it, the sooner we can see the back of you."
5553,"If we don't do something, the enchantment will eventually fade, and the Star will slip back into Oblivion. Azura will have the last laugh."
5554,You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.
5556,Hmm hmm.
5558,The Blades are wise not to trust me. Onikaan ni ov. I would not trust another dovah.
5564,"At the time, it was difficult to keep food on the table, let alone have enough left over to sell at the market."
5565,"And it looks undamaged. They'll be pleased, I'm sure. And we're pleased with their money."
5571,"Oh yes! Dragonborn! Indeed, yes."
5574,"We need to find out if the Thalmor are behind the dragons coming back. We need to get into the Thalmor Embassy, somehow..."
5578,What's this about Riverwood being in danger?
5580,She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate.
5582,I think I've taught you everything I know. You might even be as good as me now.
5583,My boy Leontius lives in Old Hroldan. Damn drunk.
5584,"It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly."
5585,Magic? Got no good use for that here. Mages keep to their College in Winterhold. Go bother them.
5586,You're right. Tullius isn't in any position to ask for Riften.
5595,A crown doesn't make a king. 
5596,"The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since."
5597,What would the Empire want in return?
5598,You're going to rot in the Dragonsreach Dungeon.
5601,That is enough.
5606,"They aren't invading, milord... it's simply a response to Ulfric and his Stormcloaks. I assure you everything will be fine."
5607,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
5610,I'm in a bit of trouble here.
5612,Just bring it back to me.
5614,"Are you now? You were at Helgen, one of the prisoners. Although no one seems to know how you got mixed up in that affair."
5615,Simple... I'm going to cause a distraction and you're going to steal Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand.
5616,"Ah, no mere brute mercenary, but a thinker - perhaps even a scholar?"
5618,Thank you. Please hurry!
5619,"Ah, good. Markarth is just ahead. I'm glad to make it through the Reach one more time."
5621,"He's off fighting the war, dear. For the Stormcloaks."
5622,"At last, the treasure is mine! All mine!"
5627,"Yes. Perhaps one day I'll be able to make the journey, but for now I need to tend the dead."
5628,Thinking of settling in? There's a house for sale - Breezehome. You should talk to the steward up in the keep if you're interested.
5630,"Look, I... I..."
5633,"Ah, everybody around here's so serious."
5635,I just hope the war doesn't come to Riverwood. There's enough trouble in the world without those Stormcloaks stirring up more.
5641,"Of course. I should've known. This was all Avulstein's idea, wasn't it? Where is he?"
5643,Go!
5644,You're asking me? She promised that she was sending someone who knew what they were doing...
5645,Down with Ulfric the killer of kings. On the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing.
5646,"Yet if only a single part of our imperfect machine fails, life fails. It makes one realize how fragile... how flawed we are."
5647,"Thank you, friend. It's good to know I can count on you."
5648,"I do. Sadly, I'm one of the few traditional Saxhleel Jewelers that remains in Tamriel; it's becoming a lost art."
5649,"A day goes by without someone trying to gut me in the street, I get disappointed."
5651,Not half as sorry as I am.
5657,"Not without us, you aren't! I'm sure there's enough for everyone, after all."
5665,"We've been trying to catch Ulfric since the war started, but he always seemed to slip through our fingers... like he knew we were coming."
5666,Let's talk for moment.
5668,Only when you're around. The rest of these fools I could do without.
5669,The other noble houses discovered her betrayal and she fled. They want her brought back alive. 
5674,"Now he's in the Emperor's pocket like the rest of 'em, with no regard for honor an' tradition."
5675,That is rich. What did she do?
5676,"You needed to do this clean and quiet, and you failed. Now we need to use your payment to cover your mistake."
5683,"Yeaaaah! Come on, we can take them!"
5691,"Wow, sure is nice of ya'. Here, hang on to the key and don't let anyone in!"
5696,This is... lovely. Calcelmo wrote this... about me? I never knew he had such feeling in him.
5699,Is it dead?
5700,"Either I'm drunk, or you're naked. Possibly both."
5702,"Are you serious? The war is tearing the land apart, the dragons have returned seeking who knows what... Skyrim is going nowhere fast."
5704,"Greetings outsider. If you have some business here, speak it."
5706,Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.
5708,Elder Scrolls. Indeed.
5710,That tablet is your priority now. Bring that back from Bleak Falls Barrow and I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.
5714,Foreigners. What a nuisance!
5716,Wow! Look at all the colors!
5717,That was well done. Come on. I've been wanting a closer look at one of these buggers.
5719,"Seems to me they're a bunch of narrow-minded bigots, just like you."
5720,"There's probably something I could find for you to do, but best to check with him."
5727,"Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious."
5728,"We respect the old ways, the Nord ways, an' a Gray-Mane has worked the Skyforge since before the time of my grandfather's father."
5730,"They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps."
5731,"I came here from the Imperial Province, to work with my brother Lucan."
5732,"I'm searching for my Fenrig. He was marching with Gjukar's men, who they say were wiped out here."
5735,"Gorm thinks I'm mad. He doesn't say it, but I know he thinks it. Is he right?"
5736,You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory?
5738,I'll meet you at the shrine.
5740,Hey! Good to see you again.
5741,"My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar."
5750,I'm not here to hold your hand. Figure this one out for yourself.
5751,You. What do you want?
5752,I'm afraid not.
5755,I'm proud to call a woman like you friend.
5758,Walking around like that is why magic gets a bad name. Shame on you.
5759,"As forge-wife, I'm also in charge of our mine."
5760,"Well met, kinsman."
5761,I don't know where to start. You know I was assigned to General Tullius's guard.
5762,The Windpeak Inn features the finest bard in all of Dawnstar. Me.
5763,"If they choose to fear me in their ignorance, that is their choice. But it will not change what is true."
5767,"What about you, Elisif? Are these terms to your liking? Speak up. I'm sure General Tullius is waiting to do your bidding."
5768,Old dwarven ruin. Look at that metalwork. Such a waste.
5769,The Jarl has things under control. Don't you worry.
5771,What are you looking at?
5772,You're going to Riften.
5780,"Okay, now can you let me out? Please? I won't tell anyone it was you."
5782,Nobody here anymore.
5785,"I won't complain about Korir being gone, but I don't expect things to really be any different."
5788,Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.
5793,If fought more than my share of bandits in places like this.
5796,Don't know what I would have done without Pavo. Man's braver than he admits.
5798,Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall.
5803,Good to hear.
5805,Don't like the looks of this.
5806,"A truly remarkable place, isn't it?"
5812,"Not until introductions are complete. Zin. Heyv. Test your Thu'um against mine, Dovahkiin!"
5813,Not really. Varnius Junius is a fool. I'm sure nothing will come of it.
5820,"Maybe you need a partner? Hmm? Just picture it. Two women, the dusty road, strapping men at every tavern, a fortune in gold to be claimed..."
5821,That's definitely going in my part of the Edda.
5823,Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be bringing me nothing but trouble anyway.
5824,"Just between us, I've got more important things to do than attend these meaningless parties."
5826,Look at those ruins. Think there's gold inside?
5830,"What do you want, cat?"
5839,Malacath teaches us to honor all words with action. To demand blood from your enemies and strength from your allies.
5841,You know I don't mean that. We need to find a way out of this. Perhaps talk to Laila...
5847,But you have indulged my weakness for speech long enough. Krosis. Now I will answer your question.
5852,"I own Hollyfrost Farm outside the city. It's honest work, if a bit dull."
5853,"If I had my way, I'd spend all my time at parties like this, and none of it dealing with the common rabble."
5854,I think this might be the end...
5856,The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.
5858,It is a shame though.
5861,"Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle."
5866,"The question is, what isn't wrong with Riften."
5870,You'll come of age soon. Time to be married to another chief.
5871,Always. Let's go see if we can find this Sky Haven Temple.
5874,"My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I'm afraid to go in by myself."
5876,"Ah, hello my Khajiit friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
5878,We haven't met.
5882,"Meet me back in Riverwood. If I'm not back when you get there, wait for me. I shouldn't be long."
5884,"The Empire may have been good for Skyrim once upon a time, but those days are long past."
5885,I'm glad to assist you in any way I can.
5886,Haven't seen him around before.
5894,Do whatever Yamarz asks of you. It cannot make things worse.
5895,Come back as soon as you have the helm.
5896,Oof!
5899,Serving in the Legion taught me to respect leadership. The stronghold needs Burguk.
5900,Hhhmmm...maybe I put it over here.
5903,I've still got some fight in me!
5909,What about my father? Was he a good hunter?
5911,Can't trust these things.
5913,That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.
5916,"The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on."
5918,I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there.
5919,"Thorald's disappearance has been hard on all of us, but Avulstein has taken it badly."
5920,"You stand in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain."
5924,Rrrraaaaaaggghhhh!
5930,"All right, calm down, no need to for that. I'll let you in right away, just need to get the gate unlocked."
5935,"Why are you still here? You're supposed to be at Korvanjund, proving Galmar right, or proving him wrong."
5936,How goes the hunt?
5938,Wish I could say the same for us.
5943,Entire years spent in libraries. Seeking out tiny villages with local legends that contain but a whisper of a hint of the Phial.
5944,Just... Do whatever it takes to get him to stop lording this over me.
5946,Trying to stay ahead of the Thalmor assassins. I'm not a hero like you. I don't stand a chance.
5954,Do you think that ghost is coming back? It seems to have vanished.
5958,"Gods bless you, healer."
5961,Sibbi Black-Briar is furious that his ex-lover tried to murder him. He's leaving no stone unturned searching for her.
5963,I'll meet you there.
5965,You are not welcome here!
5971,Faida's teaching me the innkeeper's trade. She runs the Four Shields.
5976,I fear that will be the way of it.
5979,"Perhaps, but necessary. My cousin, Fura, is somewhere out there in Skyrim right now, fighting Ulfric Stormcloak and his damned insurrectionists."
5984,"I paid Sibbi half the cost of Frost up front, but before he could deliver, Maven had him locked up. Sibbi believes this exempts him from our deal."
5985,"Hey, you. Get over here, I want to talk to you."
5986,"You know, you remind me of myself at a young age. All I cared about was riding narwhales and sleeping in honeycombs and drinking babies' tears..."
5989,You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.
5990,I've heard that shadowy figures are being seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Gods help us.
5995,Oof!
5998,"No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up."
6002,"Now, I have a soul in Oblivion to claim. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!"
6003,"Welcome to Eldergleam Sanctuary, my friend. If you have any questions, speak to Asta."
6004,"I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, this place has gone mad."
6006,"He's just waiting for the shipments, Lisbet. He'll be back as soon as they come in."
6008,"Know your place, mortal. Or Molag Bal may just send another champion to claim his mace from your broken corpse."
6012,Citizen.
6025,"Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we knew that some adjustments would have to be made."
6026,"Proventus, you're my steward. Your job is to offer me counsel. This? This is not counsel."
6027,"That's right. Welcome to Markarth, traveler. Thank the Divines you can choose to live somewhere else."
6031,"I have a good thing going here. The Jarl benefits from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible for her to admit that."
6036,He knew what he was getting into. I don't... I don't blame anyone.
6038,Your feeble attempt to hide is insulting!
6039,"Eh, let her get upset. She'll be angry no matter what I say, might as well enjoy myself."
6044,I'm afraid so. There's a problem with one of the Jarls here in Skyrim.
6045,"You get around, right? If you come across any Stormcloaks... gut one for me. They did the same to my brother in Whiterun."
6048,"Yes, you brought honor to him, even after his death. A worthy outcome for a worthy warrior."
6052,"I never knew much about Weylin, except he lives in the Warrens, like all the other workers."
6053,Rise up and live again!
6054,Looking for work?
6056,"Countless dead haunt countless sleepless nights... when Skyrim becomes whole again, perhaps so will I."
6057,"Long have you slept the dreamless sleep of death, Potema. No longer. Hear us Wolf Queen! We Summon You!"
6059,Look at the sky. Be a terrible day tomorrow. I know it.
6064,"He says that he needs me to stay here and work the farm, and even if he did let me be an adventurer, we couldn't afford to buy armor."
6066,"Hmm. I'm not sure how you managed it, but these are exactly what I need to start my next set of experiments. Wonderful!"
6067,"First, I need to know what the Imperials are planning. Need to slip into their headquarters, grab plans, maps, something useful like that."
6073,Remain vigilant and don't trust anyone.
6075,My father never thought I was smart enough to be a stablemaster. I just wish he was around to see me now.
6079,Auxiliary.
6082,"Try Olfina, the new innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market."
6086,"Oh! Well... I... I'm sorry. Yes, we have been working on something together."
6096,We cannot carry on this way! You know we are doomed if we do not do something!
6102,"I had to leave them behind, had to sacrifice them so I could make it out alive."
6103,Travel safe.
6105,"Indeed. Speak with me when the box has been opened, and all shall be revealed."
6107,I'll bury you!
6108,"But don't underestimate the Stormcloaks. Many are Legion veterans. They may be traitors, but they know how to fight."
6109,Go. Your very presence sickens me.
6110,"All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'd be much good to you, anyway. The little fop cut me pretty deep."
6113,I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the lake so he could avoid the roads.
6115,I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
6119,"Have you returned, Aren? My old friend?"
6120,"Yes, I just thought perhaps you'd have, err, come across something like this before."
6124,"It has. Here, this is your half, love."
6126,You must be mad to think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.
6127,And how about you?
6128,"Hmph. Now there's an excellent question. An excellent question, indeed. Truth is, as soon as the Emperor sets sail,  I'm resigning my position."
6129,"The battle below goes ill. If Alduin does not rise to our challenge, I fear all may be lost."
6131,I didn't touch it!
6132,Yes... one of his allies could tell us. Motmahus... But it will not be so easy to... convince one of them to betray him.
6133,You will? Thank you! Ten pinches of fire salts should give me all I need to bring this forge back to life.
6134,"You're here to blacken the Empire's name, and I won't be party to it."
6136,"I swear, I left another bottle right here..."
6138,Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.
6139,What kind of a mentor would I be if I denied a potential student a glimpse at his master's ingenuity!
6155,"Ah, yes. True. Well, thank you."
6157,My brother Vilkas is a better talker than me. He should be around someplace.
6159,"Come back when you've got the gold, then."
6160,"Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind."
6163,"Well, if you had learned to swing it correctly. A sword is an extension of the arm, not a meat cleaver."
6165,"The kind that curse you, haunt you in the dead of night. There is nothing you can do, nothing anyone can do."
6166,You got nothin' better to do than bother an old man?
6168,Hiding only prolongs your demise.
6169,"I'm sure it's hard to believe, but I was once a bold adventurer like you, ready to face any danger."
6178,"My axe is yours, outlander. Just say the word."
6180,We tunneled into an old crypt. We're warning strangers to keep out.
6182,I must be on my way now.
6183,"Yes, fellow Nightingale?"
6187,Alduin mah nol thur.
6189,"Yes, my lord."
6190,"Kodlak is right, though. We've given a piece of our souls for this power. I know my mythic histories. Bargains like that lead to ruin."
6192,"Ah, now that's a good idea. Head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think."
6193,"Markarth will be handed over to Ulfric's forces. Jarl Igmund will step down, and Thongvor Silver-Blood will become the Jarl of Markarth."
6194,"The undercroft is ahead... ugh, Necromancers. Be careful."
6195,Don't make me to defend the honor of my mead! It's been my friend a lot longer than you have!
6201,"I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do."
6203,Burn all the hives and she'd have to import honey for Black-Briar Meadery which would cut into her profits.
6204,"Well, not yet, anyway."
6205,So ends the lesson.
6207,Oh... well. Never mind then.
6208,Of course. Ulfric's cause is just. It's time for Skyrim to rid itself of the Empire.
6209,Sigh... I'm not proud of it. I'm terrified of that place and Aunt Agna knows it.
6211,"Something to tell the grandkids, eh?"
6214,"That, and a true Nord never misses a chance to test her worth."
6216,"Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?"
6222,"All eyes are on you, lass. Don't disappoint us."
6223,"Um, thank you. Sir. Was there anything else I can do for you?"
6224,"The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but by in large, the people here desire peace."
6225,"It's an old Nord Tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher."
6227,You wear the garb of a true Nord. I salute you.
6229,You don't seem to have the gold on you. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding?
6232,"Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of yours, old man."
6233,"You've done what you've had to for yourself, not for mother."
6234,Take this symbol of Mara. She will guide you to the wandering souls of two whose love was so great that their entwinement binds them to this world.
6235,Shadows consume you.
6237,"Gods, not again...."
6242,"I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere."
6243,"Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milord. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know."
6246,"Ha. Good luck to you, friend. She's not one who likes to be found."
6247,"By the gods, a dragon's been sighted just south of the city, flying around Lost Tongue Overlook."
6248,"And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life."
6252,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
6254,"The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right."
6255,"Not really my usual read, but I'll give it a try."
6259,They say that something happened in the Hall of the Dead. Brother Verulus has the whole place closed.
6261,"What is it, Redguard?"
6263,"Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt..."
6265,What do you want?
6269,"All right, you delivered on your end, so I'll deliver on mine. Here's the gem Arniel was after."
6272,I trust you've come to see the error handing the hold over to the rebels?
6273,Hello friend. Make yourself at home.
6278,I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.
6280,"In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons - beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality. Though, a rather wet, messy formality..."
6281,"If you want to get into Riften, use the North Gate. This one's closed."
6284,I was done talkin' anyway.
6288,Just visiting. I had some business here. That's all.
6289,Yay!
6291,"Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin."
6295,Blasted dark elves. I don't suppose you could tell them that I presently have larger concerns? Such as all of Skyrim?
6296,"If you come across anything in your travels that might provide me with the answers I'm looking for, I'd be grateful."
6297,"I ain't going to lie, it's still pretty bad."
6298,"I'd go down there myself, but that would leave Jarl Laila unprotected."
6306,Are you ready to for Serpentstone Island?
6307,"I... I'm so sorry, Torbjorn. You must be suffering terribly. I wish there was some way I could help."
6308,Uh... yeah.
6310,"But then came the Tongues on that terrible day. Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray."
6317,Good afternoon.
6320,Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.
6321,"Vignar and I have our hands full. It's no small task, running an entire hold."
6322,She's agreed to be your forebear.
6326,"The people still doubt me, don't they."
6327,I'm not impressed.
6330,Hard to believe I ever complained about Riften being cold...
6331,"They are indeed. Nothing like your mother, though!"
6332,You really thought you could get away with it?
6333,"Bits and baubles for sale, all crafted by the best blacksmith in Skyrim."
6335,Did you find all of the vessels?
6337,"Yes, I have. Adara made the rings herself. She is learning to bend the metal well."
6338,"Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap."
6339,"Brynjolf, something stinks around here and it's more than just the Ratway. We all know it. The question is, what's Mercer going to do about it?"
6342,Do you think muscling me is going to work? I'm a wizard. An old. Elven. Wizard. Think about it.
6343,"Here, take my satchel and give it to my father, Verner. He'll likely have something for you to bring back."
6345,Look along the east coast. The boat will be there.
6346,"This was the last great bastion of the Dragon Cult, and their leader's mask was reported to be quite powerful."
6347,"You Imperials are efficient, I'll give you that. "
6350,"We've been here as long as either of us can remember, though. So try to show some respect."
6352,"Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us."
6359,"Grandson. He's a strong lad. His parents were at Helgen when, well you know."
6361,Oh it's you. The one from the market. 
6363,"I'm sure my brother Vignar is, since they made him Jarl after throwing Balgruuf out."
6364,"Ha! Well, when you put it like that, it certainly puts things into perspective. But enough wallowing. And thank you, Danica."
6365,A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense.
6366,We'll be waiting to take her into custody.
6368,"Thanks, Grelka!"
6371,A fight!
6373,"Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my kitchen."
6374,Do that and I'll make sure you get a cut.
6375,"That's what caused all the trouble. Soul gems are used in enchanting, but they break afterwards. Except one."
6381,"Take what you need, my friend. Within reason, of course."
6384,"Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did."
6386,"You've saved my business and warmed an old smith's heart. For that, I thank you."
6389,Pray to Stendarr while you can!
6390,Mathies is a kind and wise man. The Nords could use more like him. So could the Imperials.
6392,"Leaving? Take the world by storm, dearest."
6395,The guard has the key.
6400,So congratulations! You're free to go!
6403,There's only one chief!
6406,"Are you excited to see what's in there? This is important to you Nords, isn't it?"
6407,"If you wish to trade, wait for the sun to rise."
6409,"I'm not a scholar, Esbern. How many times do I have to tell you?"
6410,"We fought them off, but... "
6413,You have quite a house. I'm thinking of setting up a small store here. Sell odds and ends.
6420,Very good. Let's continue with our practice.
6422,"All right, mother."
6424,"It's not my fault they turned their backs on the Empire, or their mule of a son raised arms against it."
6425,Dead? How did this happen?
6426,"In fact, I once took a seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn... which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle."
6428,That's done it! Let's get in there.
6435,Make it hurt. But not too much. No killing. And don't let the guards catch you.
6438,You'll need to do better than that.
6439,Of course not. My mistake.
6441,Just tell me who needs bludgeoning.
6445,"Shadows creep, and... and phantoms leap! A man got... he got scared. And the demons dared! To um... visit upon him all which they feared!"
6449,You came to visit! It's so much better here with Grelod gone. Thanks to you.
6455,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
6459,Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity you've chosen the wrong side...
6461,"You know what? I want you to keep it. My great hunts are behind me, but yours are yet to come."
6462,"It was little more than a chaotic uprising, but the Reach was removed from Imperial authority for two years before we reclaimed it."
6463,This was their city once. They won't stop until we're all dead.
6465,"Hmph. Help them drink up our mead, you mean."
6467,Don't you go pulling my leg. Give it here.
6468,"Now, what's this nonsense about trapping a dragon in my palace?"
6469,You... you did? He has?
6480,"Sky above, Voice within."
6487,"And far to the west lies a ruin. Volskygge. Inside, there is said to be a wall, black as night. And it speaks! In the ancient Dragon tongue!"
6494,"Forsworn attacked a while back. Jarl had no men to spare, so the Silver-Bloods generously offered to send us to clean things up."
6495,"We meet again, mortal!"
6496,"It was you convinced the Jarl to trap that dragon in the keep. And by Ysmir, it actually worked."
6501,"Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her."
6502,"As I've said, a donation of 250 should help take care of that."
6503,"Stab you, stab you, stab you!"
6506,I said move!
6508,"Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and you're going to leave me alone. Deal?"
6509,I suggest you listen to what Mercer has to say... if you want in.
6512,"She was always so close to being Empress, but despite her machinations, it was never to be hers."
6515,"I can help with purchases, but if you came to talk, see my sister. She's the one who gets on with people. It's her one virtue, really."
6516,He's always used the ban on the worship of Talos to stir people up against the Empire.
6517,Is it true? Are there really dragons in Skyrim?
6518,"So you think you can make it on your own, then? We'll just see about that."
6520,"You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition."
6521,"If you want to ask her about them, good luck. But I'm not going near her."
6522,The afterlife will bring you darkness.
6524,What do you suppose this is all about?
6525,"I cannot stay. Not here, not in Whiterun. It likely won't be safe for Avulstein, either."
6526,I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely.
6530,What can I get you? Mead? Wine?
6531,We should keep moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
6533,"Dragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay!"
6539,"Carlotta put you up to this, didn't she? I'm sorry, but that fiery widow is mine. She just doesn't know it yet."
6541,Because getting rid of the Empire was only half the problem. 
6542,"Mikael, son. How about something with a bit o' kick?"
6543,I'm sure that the owner of that place is relieved. They certainly came through with the coin.
6546,"You are an Orc, but do not know of Malacath, our master and yours?"
6547,"But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and is doing some kind of dark ritual. He's trying to summon some killers to come get old Grelod."
6549,"I never agreed. And if you are right, I will not need it."
6550,Oh... I've heard of this. These walls are supposed to show the history of the ancients who built this place.
6554,"Thank you for telling me the truth. Could you talk to Faendal, as well?  I'm sure he'll want to thank you for standing up for him."
6558,"Geh, Sahloknir, kaali mir."
6562,"Madesi, have you heard the Imperials might be headed this way? What would we do?"
6567,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
6572,"My specialty is pickpocketing. All I need is a rich mark, a moon-lit sky and I'm in my element."
6574,"Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim. It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years."
6576,"Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get."
6583,Come see me in Windhelm when this is all done. There's always work for those willing to fight for Skyrim.
6585,Not going to weigh in either way?
6587,"Skyrim needs people like you, if we ever hope to regain our freedom from the damned Empire. Good luck."
6590,Just shut up and keep out of sight.
6592,"We're pleased to have her in Riften. She brings stability, opportunities for employment and strategic value to our city."
6596,"Another uncounted causality of this war. Here you are, you poor man."
6605,No fighting just yet. Not till Skjor says so. We train now.
6608,This better be important.
6609,"Even still, I make a point of announcing myself when I enter her room now. I spooked her so bad last time she almost threw the chamber pot at me!"
6610,"Oh, how reassuring! Most likely you're with the Thalmor and this is just a trick to get me to open the door!"
6612,"You're the one with the staff, my boy."
6613,Oh. Is it your... first time?
6614,Resisting arrest will mean your death.
6618,"However, I must insist that my laboratory remains strictly off limits."
6620,"I don't need this. My family wasted 8 generations keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far as I care, it can stay locked in my house."
6621,"Just another minute, please."
6628,Fine. Don't tell me. But I know that look in your eyes. Someone who's faced death at the hands of the law.
6630,Have anything you wish to sell? I pay fair prices for all sorts of goods.
6631,Now everyone get back to work.
6636,"From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil Sanctum, my path changed its course."
6638,"I know your family's honor is important to you, but we can't afford it!"
6639,Still no word from your family?
6640,"Look at me ramble... Well, I guess I'll go about my business sulking in here. You can stand over there in the corner watching for assassins."
6642,I hope Alva is not what you think.
6643,"Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person."
6644,"What weapon do you like, Harbinger?"
6645,These two aren't a problem anymore.
6646,Is it safe now?
6648,"His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together."
6650,"Fine. If you can't pay with coin, you'll pay with your life!"
6652,"There is skill in magic, there is charm, and there is a strong will. J'zargo will be successful, of this there is no doubt."
6655,Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to the Blue Palace.
6657,So what - Ulfric gets this crown and then suddenly he's High King?
6660,We have nothing to say to each other. Paarthurnax's murder is beyond my powers of forgiveness.
6662,That's the way I like it. Short and bloody. They never knew what hit them.
6667,"If you're thinking of setting up to farm, you picked the right place. "
6668,"I suspect Brurid planned this, there's been bad blood between us since the king's death."
6669,Where did you learn of that? Who have you been talking to?
6674,"Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial near there. If we can get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it."
6679,It's too late. There isn't enough of him left to go back in after.
6681,Is he... dead?
6686,"I should have expected as much. Fine, I shall give you 200 gold, and you shall leave me in peace."
6689,"We're expected to fight there tomorrow. Gjukar elected to camp here for the night. I don't like it, though."
6698,We're playing Hunt the Elf. You're the Elf.
6699,"Wait, let me guess. You'll get to it later."
6704,"Difficult? I am a Jarl. I eat the most succulent meat, drink the finest ale and hunt with the best hounds in the hold."
6705,"I personally trained a whole litter for the Jarl. That reminds me, I was going to deliver some dog food to the Keep. Spiced beef. Their favorite."
6706,"Looks like something one of the dark elves would wear. Ask Revyn Sadri, he probably sold whatever it used to be."
6710,I grant you a new life!
6712,"The thought of paying a dowry to that, that... Stormcloak turns my stomach."
6715,By the gods. You... you're alive! But I had heard... your Sanctuary...
6718,By the Eight?! What... what's in this?
6724,"No. They ain't. And they aren't gonna. If you weren't payin' for your room, I'd have thrown you out a long time ago."
6727,"Now please, go. Collect your money, and let us never look upon one another again. Our business, thank the gods, is concluded."
6729,Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the right direction.
6732,Esbern. What are you getting at?
6734,Being a Jarl could hardly be simpler. You should try it sometime.
6735,"I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls."
6736,"Sky Haven Temple it is, then. I knew you'd have something for us, Esbern."
6739,Excellent. I think you'll be glad that you made this decision.
6740,"Oh, all things in time, my boy. All things in time. "
6742,"Can't say I'm looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for their new armies."
6751,I'm off work at the Black-Briar Meadery. I'll be back there in the morning.
6753,"And it is for these reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of ""High King."" "
6754,"Yes, sir."
6760,"Stop yammering and keep your eyes peeled. They could be here at any moment. If I were them I'd come straight here, sword swingin'!"
6764,"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Bear pelts."
6769,Keep to the shadows and you'll do fine.
6770,"Who are you? You... you're with the Dark Brotherhood, ain'tcha? I knew it. I knew you'd come for me!"
6771,"Try not to disturb me in the future, I'm in the midst of groundbreaking research!"
6772,Are you in some kind of trouble?
6776,I'm going with you whether you like it or not. 
6779,"If the damn Blades are no match for the Thalmor, what chance do I have?"
6780,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
6785,"Come on now, we discussed that. I wouldn't be traveling all of Skyrim. It'd just to Whiterun and back, that's it."
6787,Good luck. You're on your own now.
6796,"By Ysmir, this will not end well..."
6806,"Get to the College, before it's too late!"
6811,"Got to thinking, maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet."
6817,"Oh splendid, another Nord."
6823,"Your shield... Dwarf-make, is it not? But yet it seems so much... more."
6825,Quaestor.
6826,I need you to create some chaos in the hold so I can maneuver men into position without drawing too much attention.
6828,Heyargh!
6829,"Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine."
6832,"Eh, fine. I can tell you aren't worth the trouble. Just get out of here before I change my mind."
6833,Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now don't let the name worry you - we got plenty o' steel for fightin' men.
6835,You must be one of those wizards. From the College in Winterhold.
6838,"J'zargo will go wherever he can to learn more. Oblivion itself, if need be."
6839,You need advice? Talk to Brynjolf... I got better things to do.
6840,I haven't heard a true shout in generations!
6842,"You'll need to talk to Jorleif, though. We can't just let anyone go around claiming to be on official business."
6843,I work for Eydis. She runs the inn.
6849,"The only people I offend are cheats who don't pay me enough gold coin, or idiots who don't know good meat when I throw it at their faces."
6853,"If you're looking to get a drink, Candlehearth Hall's got warm fires and strong ale."
6857,There's no chance anyone in authority approved this.
6859,"Umm... you're not planning on using that weapon, are you? At least not on me... right?"
6863,Nothing you need to concern yourself with. I shall be quite capable of observing everything that goes on here.
6865,"I, well, no of course not. I would be glad to help."
6866,The Emperor is going to love it. How can he not?
6868,I think I have some more of these padding my mattress.
6878,"You must also pledge unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her people."
6879,You have business with Clavicus Vile?
6880,So am I. I hope she's happy at the temple.
6881,"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
6883,Call... that... a... swing?
6884,"Begging your pardon my lady, but I strongly recommend against it."
6885,"Oh, and if you meet Maven Black-Briar, stay on her good side. This is her city, and nobody else's."
6887,I'm sorry about my housekeeper. She's a little protective of me.
6889,"I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters."
6890,Good. Honor to you.
6891,"Well, perhaps that is why you're merely an Apprentice here."
6894,"If you're looking for opportunities to make some coin, well... I'm your man."
6895,My blade thirsts for your blood!
6900,"The court wizard of Markarth, Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal translated."
6901,"I'm... Well, who I am isn't important. Let's leave it at that, hmm?"
6903,"However, if we lose the war, the guardsmen of Solitude will make little difference in the end."
6910,The Legion is here! Defend the entrance!
6912,Azura. Who led her children away from the disaster of Vvardenfell. You are the prophet that reveals our true future.
6914,"Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy."
6915,"Thieves used to hole up in Fort Snowhawk there, but they were run out. Wizards, they say. Suits me fine, so long as they mind their own by."
6917,Why! Why?!
6918,"In those days, dragons could still be found among the remote mountain peaks."
6922,I'd like to pay you to hurt somebody else. For me.
6933,"People say I'm making gold off of other people's misery, but what else would I do? Smithing is all I know."
6935,"Whiterun belongs to the true sons of Skyrim now, just as it should."
6938,UUggghhhh.....
6941,"Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?"
6942,"The Empire showed its true colors today, eh? Don't worry. I was once loyal to the Empire, too, before my eyes were opened."
6945,All aboard!
6947,You're not one of my workers. What are you doing here?
6948,Steady. I don't know what's happening. Let's watch and wait.
6949,The Argonians can't even live inside the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks.
6951,Go now! The orcs could breach the inner sanctum at any moment!
6952,"Yes. I've heard stories that Old Hroldan was haunted, but no ones seen a ghost here since the Great War."
6955,"Alftand. The point of puncture, of first entry, of the tapping. "
6958,Fresh fish! Fresh fish!
6965,"Usually it's to free someone the client cares about... and sometimes to... well, to kill someone on their behalf."
6966,"But, I bow before your certainty. In a way I envy you. The curse of much knowledge is often indecision."
6967,"Good, good. Just point me in the right direction and I'll do the rest."
6968,"That's it! Come on, let's get out of here before the dragon brings the whole tower down on our heads."
6971,"Folk been hearing some strange stuff coming from the Aretino place. Chanting. Talk is, little Aventus is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood..."
6974,I envy you travelers. Dreams aren't affecting anyone not from here.
6975,(Sobbing)
6978,"When it was clear we were going to have to fall back, she stayed behind and made sure the rest of us were all right."
6983,"After what happened to those other women, I'm worried about my own safety."
6984,Done? Let's get moving.
6985,"If you'll check the shelves around the balcony, I'll check around the lower level."
6986,"Not your concern, anyway."
6987,Are you joking?
6988,Crazy n'wah - you're trying to get someone killed?
6989,"Taken alone, the draugr aren't so fearsome. They're far more deadly in greater numbers."
6990,"So, have you gotten Nettlebane back from those filthy Hagravens yet? "
6991,"Don't cross me, Elf."
6993,It is from her love of us that we first learned to love one another. It is from this love that we learn that a life lived alone is no life at all.
6996,"If you're looking for handouts, look somewhere else."
7002,"Bolli, I was looking at the finances and I noticed you've been donating gold to the Temple of Mara. Are you out of your mind?"
7004,And we have come this far because our cause is true. Because we fight as one. And because our hearts are bursting with anger!
7006,"Help, someone!"
7007,Good work. Take this.
7010,Malacath demands much of us now. We will not fail him again.
7011,"Something about placing it back in Yngol's chamber, I don't know."
7015,Touchy. Maybe some Dunmer lives in you yet. 
7016,"Well, I did see something interesting not long ago."
7017,One of the quickest ways to make some coin in Skyrim is to clear out some of the wealthier homes of their valuables.
7019,So serious! (Laughter)
7020,"Well, I just did what had to be done. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'm just glad I lived to tell the tale."
7021,"You dare strut around here, wearing that filthy Stormcloak hide?"
7025,Why's someone like you want to hang around a place like this?
7026,"Here? Right here? Very well, J'zargo shall wait."
7027,Good. I'll do the same. We've still got plenty of shafts from that Riverwood shipment.
7028,"Thank you for coming, sister."
7029,"Riften's under my protection. You watch yourself, now."
7031,Always glad to talk to a bard.
7032,Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation to visit Skyrim.
7037,We've no need for wizards in our midst!
7038,"Yeah, I was lucky though. After Vex tore the guy to pieces, she gave me a potion. If she hadn't of been there..."
7040,"Ah. Well, then. Let me know if you need anything."
7042,I fear this truce will not last. General Tullius will be looking for any opportunity to regain the advantage.
7047,"Even if these carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to find a way through this door."
7052,"Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin."
7054,Ooof!
7060,One of the Jarls has asked for our help.
7064,True... we could simply make sure she never reaches Narzulbur.
7066,Redbelly Mine gets its name from the red mist filling the place.
7070,I'll never surrender Skyrim into the hands of a corrupt and dying Empire.
7072,You are a very brave woman. But I already knew that.
7074,Sure thing. It's yours for a day.
7077,"We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry."
7079,"Oh, what a clever thief you are."
7080,Back to making weapons.
7082,I need dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
7083,Blessings of Mara upon you!
7084,"There's always some sort of trouble in The Reach, but a local warlord has raised the stakes. We have to handle the situation."
7086,"The Divines saved me from the streets, and they can save you from your trials, as well."
7091,"Your power over others shall be great, like mine."
7093,"If nobody wants that, I'll take it."
7094,"We must maintain order and put the rebellious Jarls in their place, before we have a full scale war on our hands."
7095,"I've heard that a priest of Mara has come, saying that the Divines will lift this curse somehow, but that remains to be seen."
7102,You're no liar. Best fight I've had in years. There you are.
7103,Good. Now get going.
7107,"Interesting, to say the least. What with all that's been going on."
7109,First you... then all of the Reach!
7111,"Keeping busy, Sergius?"
7118,I remember you. You're the stranger. Father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
7119,"I really do need you to stay in place, please. I don't want to risk hurting any of the other Apprentices."
7120,"Yes. This was ages ago, you understand. There were more of us then. Before the bruniikke - the Akaviri - came and killed all my zeymah."
7121,It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.
7123,Sides quickly formed behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.
7125,Did you call me?
7129,Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your superior.
7134,"I have a lot to do around the farm, so make it quick please. What is it you wanted?"
7135,Do you need anything else?
7137,When are you going to take me away from here Bolli?
7141,Was there something specific you needed?
7143,What did you expect? That no one was going to notice you butting into business that wasn't yours?
7147,"You've done this city a mighty service, friend."
7152,"Bold words, Battle-Born. While you're meting out justice to traitors, are you going to deal with the Emperor, as well?"
7154,"We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth."
7155,We want compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
7159,I knew I could count on you.
7163,I've been thinking we need to be more... discreet.
7164,"I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago."
7165,"Not so sure? Oh, then perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh?"
7166,No. I will have no part of any such Empire. And I will gladly gut anyone who says otherwise.
7168,"Now, thanks to my mother's generosity, this city is making its mark."
7182,Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.
7183,Many of my countrymen joined the rebels. They can't see the big picture. Skyrim needs the Empire as much as it needs us.
7185,"If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric."
7186,The ears of the wind?
7193,All the time.
7197,There's an old saying that only a Nord can work the soil in Skyrim. I don't think anyone else would have the patience for it.
7200,"The Lord of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Devourer of Trinimac. The Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, He-Who-Destroys and She-Who-Erases..."
7205,"So, have you thought about what I said?"
7206,"The sooner we can get out of this filth-pit, the better."
7210,"Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your status to the same, Karliah."
7213,You go on ahead.
7216,"Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip."
7218,"Why the Elven blade, hmm? Nord steel not good enough for you?"
7221,Shouldn't you be out ruining someone's special day?
7224,Have you seen one in your travels?
7225,Nobody else would even know which end to hold. 
7227,"Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus."
7230,"Sithis' whisper be upon you, sister."
7232,"Oh, he was young, and handsome. I had half a mind to go after him, myself, before I met my husband."
7233,How have things been with you?
7234,"You're not planning on using that weapon in here, I hope."
7236,Let's go.
7241,"Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?"
7246,"All right, hand over your valuables, or I'll gut you like a fish."
7248,"Ah, so they've finally sent someone to deal with that lunatic."
7253,"This is getting ridiculous. If we can't get this open soon, the boss will have our heads."
7255,...dreaming... Defilers! Kill the defilers!
7258,Brother? Is... Is that you?
7259,"He treats me like a slave... I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery."
7261,"If you can sneak into their camp and steal his plans, we'll have the advantage."
7263,"Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient and have been able to avoid identification for years."
7264,"I've never seen anyone with skills like yours. I just wanted to let you know that if you need anything, you can talk to me."
7266,I believe the Legate gave you an order. I expect you to follow it. Dismissed.
7267,"I was hoping to head into Riften for supplies, but I can do that after I'm done with the elms."
7268,Hey! I didn't ask you to magic me.
7270,"Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure."
7271,Maybe we should just admit that this is a horrible place for a mill.
7273,Listen you impudent cur. According to my scrying something happened at Wolfskull Cave that returned Potema to this world.
7277,Can you... can you possibly help J'zargo?
7278,Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that some day and make him proud of me.
7287,"I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge."
7291,I'll see to it that Sorli is safe now that she's running Morthal.
7295,You looking for anything in particular this time?
7299,Alduin? The World-Eater himself? But... how can we fight him? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
7300,"Shor's Crown, that woman never gives up. I guess that's why I married her."
7301,Go away! This is my wreck! Mine!
7302,"Not yet. You know you're asking for some pretty strange stuff, don't you? It's not easy to find."
7304,You should buy some produce from Carlotta's stall. Most of it comes from my farm.
7306,I am honored to be chosen.
7307,Argonian.
7314,It's about Ranmir.
7320,"If you wish to gain Boethiah's attention, you must slay a thrall upon her shrine."
7322,Strangers are nothing but trouble.
7323,"Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key."
7331,"Oh, I see. Yes, yes of course I'll take a look. Just bring them by whenever it's convenient for you."
7333,"He he. Don't forget that I am Shadowscale. I was, quite literally, born to kill."
7335,"Now, do me the honor I deserve as your father and drink up!"
7336,Hjalti? Is that you? I've been waiting.
7338,"I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks."
7341,"Actually, I want you to bring him something. You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances."
7348,Haal...Viik!
7352,"I enjoy this work well enough, but I'm ready to retire. I've been thinking of selling the inn to Ysolda. Anyway, what do you need?"
7354,Lead the way!
7356,"I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!"
7358,That's a shame. What's causing them all the trouble?
7360,"Stupid Lars Battle-Born. I fight him almost every day, but it's not much of a fight, 'cause he don't fight back."
7362,Damn place is filled with this reddish mist. Can't see more than ten feet in front of your face.
7363,"Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired."
7366,Might want to put it away that weapon... unless you plan on using it.
7367,"Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much."
7369,"Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little sickly."
7370,There's too much of an obsession these days with knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well-placed spell.
7373,I can't wait to get my hands around that bastard's neck.
7374,Rexus. The items.
7379,What decision is there to be made? I allowed him to live here. I stand by that.
7383,Do you ever get a weird feeling about those sisters?
7390,"Ah, but it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it? I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it..."
7392,"Hey, I still have a contact in Valenwood that may have some work for us. You're welcome to join me."
7394,Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he came back from Atmora.
7397,I'm not going to warn you again.
7398,"She's our only child, Boti. Am I to throw her to the wolves?"
7399,I'll do you ten gold at three to one on the white one.
7400,"Curses aren't enough, now must I suffer you too? What is it?"
7401,So be it. Tell Ulfric and General Tullius that the Greybeards wish to speak to them.
7403,I don't really know anyone at the College. I guess everyone just assumes I do because I'm a Dunmer.
7405,"Another day, another opportunity to learn!"
7406,"I see everything, hear everything and know everything."
7407,I was starting to think you might never come back.
7408,"We couldn't have taken this city without you, ma'am."
7410,Ah. I see.
7411,"What troubles you, husband?"
7412,And... what did she say?
7417,Support Ulfric or die trying. There's nothing in between.
7418,Better to stick together down here.
7419,You should know. You got the map for me from Bleak Falls Barrow.
7420,"A powerful force, not to be crossed. As I learned too late."
7421,"We're a small meadery, but growing quickly. Sabjorn's only been running this place for a short time now and look at it."
7424,"No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about."
7437,Most scholars believe that the Nords of old used these implements to prepare their dead for burial.
7438,"Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother."
7440,Only reason Jarl keeps Anton on is because he cooks up a storm.
7443,Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?
7445,"Farewell, stranger."
7451,"Grab what you can, and let's go."
7458,"But now that I've got Rocksplinter here, I can cut through stone like a hot knife through butter."
7462,Thanks for warning me. I'll see to it this is taken care of.
7464,"I... I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done nothing to you."
7469,"I swear, you people are an odd bunch. Please, just step aside, that I may return to my duties!"
7471,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
7474,You've already purchased every available improvement. I'm afraid I have nothing else to offer you.
7476, 
7477,"But first, tell me. Why's a Redguard want to fight for Skyrim?"
7478,The others'll have to find another way out.
7480,I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me.
7481,"Ainethach's dead, but that doesn't mean we can stop working."
7482,"It's a sword. I made it for the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. It's a surprise, and I don't even know if he'll accept it. But..."
7487,"I'm not going to warn you again. Get out, or I'll call the guards!"
7488,It is time he is replaced - in the traditional fashion.
7492,"Right, which we had already established. And you managed to hide the body as well? Good."
7494,That's the North Gate in case you forget.
7497,"Not sure. I know that it starts with Moon Sugar, but all sorts of other ingredients are added to increase its potency."
7498,"You've come to Dawnstar at a strange time, friend. Seems everyone in the town is having nightmares..."
7500,"I don't know about you, tekla, but all my prayers are silent and who I pray to is still my own to decide."
7501,It was a pleasure.
7504,"Been married many times, but the gods keep taking them from me."
7511,The mine is closed. Get lost.
7512,"If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn."
7514,Bah! You're just as bad as the rest of them.
7518,You have no idea.
7519,Ha ha! I've suffered worse!
7520,"Well, let's just say that I know some people who are experts at helping others disappear when they need to."
7523,"Here, for your trouble."
7526,"No, I'm not. Looks like we've got something in common, then."
7528,"Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me."
7533,I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be.
7536,Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood.
7543,"When my aunt got married, they had a cake that was three feet tall. I got really sick that day."
7545,I don't want to believe it. Wuunferth has been a trusted friend to Ulfric for many years.
7546,Breath and focus.
7550,My brother in crime... what'd you need?
7552,"Here, take this. Assuming they even honor it, you should be able to get your prisoner out."
7554,"Hello? You! Over here! Please, I need help!"
7556,It's time to leave.
7560,And what about Jarl Elisif?
7562,"This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I first discovered my, shall we call it ""aptitude,"" for elimination."
7569,What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?
7572,Lead me into battle.
7577,"By the gods, stop toying with me and do it!"
7583,Now move.
7587,"And I have already received word that the client is satisfied. You have done well for yourself, and for the Companions."
7588,Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. What can I do for you?
7591,They don't have to be perfect. Just send them over when they're ready.
7592,"Careful, there's a pressure plate around here. I've triggered it before and got pelted with darts."
7594,"I wish I could say that it was, but it's not that simple."
7597,"She uses a very secret blend of spices, fresh honey from Goldenglow Estate and specially constructed aging casks to ensure the best flavor."
7600,This is more delicate work than you're used to.
7603,"So, what is it? What have you done?"
7604,"The logistics of such an endeavor will be staggering, I know. There will be several minor assassinations necessary. Leading up to the... main target."
7608,"That's fine. We needed his help. Now we don't, and it's long past time for him to pay for his crimes."
7611,I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time if you ask me.
7613,"Morthal doesn't need any trouble. You keep your nose clean, understand?"
7617,"Unless, of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment."
7622, 
7623,"I haven't signed any deals yet, but I'm sure my cousin will want a cut if I do. What better way to soothe his wounded pride? "
7627,Very well. I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fun.
7628,It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn. One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim himself.
7633,We want compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
7636,"Yes, Mulush."
7638,"Did you see those guards? Get out of line, and you'll have them to deal with."
7641,Lead on. Skjor's already scouting ahead. 
7647,Fine. The hilt is in a chest inside my house.  Here are the keys. Take that damn thing and go.
7648,"You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to Arn, there'll be hell to pay."
7651,"Please, anything you can do to help find my Thorald..."
7654,There's a cave here. Bears if we're lucky. Trolls if we're not.
7661,Can I help with it? Maybe just the cuirass?
7662,"Jarl Olaf One-Eye it was, who later became High King."
7664,"As in death there is new life, in Oblivion there is a beginning for that which has ended."
7665,Glad the antidote is taking effect.
7667,Everyone else though.... They're horrible. Imagine dying over and over again in your dreams night after night.
7668,Can't you just tell me if the grip is bad?
7671,Hey! I know. The Jarl's wizard could teach ya. He's lots closer.
7673,Here we go.
7680,"We are special envoys of the Aldmeri Dominion, the rightful rulers of Tamriel. If you'd like I can show you why. "
7681,What should we have tonight?
7687,"To hear Farkas tell it, our father raised us here as happy pups, running around biting knees."
7688,But someone still has quite a bit to do. Hmmm?
7689,"You are going to brew a new batch of ale, right? Like we talked about? What we have's been sitting in that barrel for over a month."
7692,So now we're rich and now I'm chief. 
7695,"Oh! Well in that case, lead on. I'm right behind you."
7698,"There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods."
7700,"Now, as for your wish... Power, was it?"
7702,Come closer. Bask in my presence.
7704,"Well come back when you do, my friend. Come back when you do."
7705,"Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that."
7707,"Hey! There you are, you drunken bastard. I did it, so pay up."
7711,"Alms. Give me some meat, you fat Nord!"
7713,Thoring runs the inn. Speak to him.
7716,Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
7719,Here's the name and location of the client.
7720,I'm not getting any younger. Let's get this ceremony done with.
7721,"Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something."
7723,That's some good armor you've put together.
7729,Huh... what was that? What'd you do?
7731,"Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this."
7734,Let's go. I'd rather not stay out here alone any longer than I have to.
7737,As am I. 
7746,Prisoners smuggle the stuff in. Only currency we have down here.
7748,Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.
7750,"It's unfortunate that we live in such violent times, but there you have it."
7753,"Firstly, I've never even seen Morrowind. Secondly, in volcanic soil the plants practically grow themselves."
7754,With a Voice wielding power of the ancient Nord art.
7755,"If you provoke me, I will be forced to unsheathe my claws."
7760,I didn't say I wouldn't fight the giant. I just said you're going to help me get to it.
7763,"You must speak with Astrid. Here, in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary."
7764,"Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an ""...unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures."""
7765,Did you really?
7767,"Never. Not until we turn this mine around, drive Beitild out of business, and force her to apologize to me for everything she's done!"
7771,Hmm. Feel a bit better now. Thanks.
7773,Ready to get going?
7774,Someone get that thing out of here and burn it.
7775,"I think you're all right. In fact, I'm kind of impressed how well you're doing around here. Just keep it between us, okay?"
7777,Be careful. They're faster than you'd think.
7781,You gave Ulfric more than he deserved. This will certainly prolong the war.
7782,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
7783,They picked on the wrong old man.
7785,"I hardly noticed you were gone. Got your share of the spoils right here, boss."
7787,He's a rogue mage who defected at the beginning of the war.  I turned him in but apparently he escaped and now this.
7792,"I wonder what we could've done with the Eye, had it been put to better use?"
7795,"You want to know more? Ask Calcelmo. He's usually in front of the ruins, just down the tunnel."
7797,"If you would, please also contain your summons to the College grounds. The locals do not need to be agitated further by Atronachs roaming their town."
7798,"Oh, I know who you are. Don't be so surprised. You ain't the first assassin sent to kill me. Won't be the last. Now let's get this over with."
7804,"It's not as bad as before, but I still can't get a good night's sleep."
7809,Why don't you just kill me already.
7810,"When you get to be my age, you don't remember why you did much of anything. "
7811,Didn't think you had the coin for it anyway.
7815,The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?
7817,"As a matter of fact, there is something you can do for me."
7822,You escaped Cidhna Mine? With Madanach? Everyone in the Warrens has been praising your name.
7824,"Sure, what can I do for you?"
7827,"So you have the Voice, then? I would be quite impressed to see that."
7828,We want compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
7835,We've got another dozen ripening on the vine. They should be ready in a few days.
7836,"If you die, then I'll have no further use for your corpse."
7838,Spare a coin for a fellow Nord who's down on his luck?
7839,"""I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you."""
7843,"Oh, just a matter of finding the right suppliers."
7848,"Yes, Nightingale, what is it?"
7851,Fair enough.
7854,"You smell like a pig's pen, too. What a stink! Have you been rolling in the dirt all day?"
7859,Our Guild Master graces me with a visit. What can I do for you?
7860,Damn shame.
7861,Hmm?
7862,Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You have your work cut out for you.
7865,Hun...
7868,You just sit tight. I'll get around to it eventually.
7871,My only aim is to keep the peace.
7874,All right. It's time to deliver the final blow to the Stormcloak rebellion.
7875,No... not when we're so close...
7877,"I just wanted to get a better look at you. I like what I see, my dear."
7878,Then suffer the Emperor's wrath.
7880,"The who? I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about."
7881,Next Imperial I see is dead.
7883,"If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip."
7887,Ahh!
7889,"Our actions were shameful. Surely, the Night Mother weeps this day."
7890,"Trust you saw the house that burned down. Peculiar bit of business, that was."
7894,Our tree here in the city was grown from a cutting of that tree. You can still feel the glory of the mother tree through it.
7896,"It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade."
7897,Good. I can use someone I can trust.
7906,"If it were up to you, the Dragonborn would sit dreaming on this mountain doing nothing!"
7909,Falling in with either would threaten to draw much unwanted attention to our College.
7910, 
7911,It lick the panes and smokes the glass... 
7913,"You need something you're not officially supposed to have, you come see me."
7914,Windhelm is absolutely freezing. How can these people tolerate it?
7918,Better to stick together down here.
7919,"When you work hard enough, really get into a rhythm, everything else just fades away."
7921,That is who we are. The Forsworn. Criminals in our own lands. And we will cut a bloody hole into the Reach until we are free.
7925,But... who exactly are you? And why are you in here? I think it best you leave Mzinchaleft. These ruins can be quite... dangerous.
7926,So thanks.
7929,"One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in their blood. "
7931,"Yes, and just like weeds, they're nothin' but trouble."
7934,"That is to say, it's been suggested that resources used for my study of Restoration could be put to better use. Any other use, in fact."
7937,Rumor has it they can get you anything for the right price.
7939,"I can promise you when he's ready, he'll find the cell door unlocked."
7940,I'll speak with Farkas about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
7942,These are no dainty college mages. Bashnag has the skill of a magister and the mind of a warlord. This is a dangerous bunch.
7943,"My Jarl, we need to discuss the Forsworn."
7945,"Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you will be High King. "
7950, 
7953,I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.
7955,"Riften seems like a better choice to me. Well-fortified, easily resupplied across Lake Honrich. Plus all the mead we can drink."
7956,"Finally, all the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor are in my hands. It's time I let you in on something."
7957,I saw you steal that!
7959,I want to be on the right side.
7960,I don't think it's safe mining a cave on top of that crypt.
7962,All I can tell you for now is that he's abused his authority as a Nightingale.
7965,"Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation."
7971,Don't let the door slam into your backside on the way out.
7977,You are correct.
7982,Klo!
7985,"Okay. I'll get this inside the Embassy for you. I've got to go. I'll find you at the party, don't worry."
7987,"Listen, lad. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective."
7989,He was after Margret. Why?
7990,"Of course, leave an old man with a ruined dream. Just like everyone else. Fool."
7993,"And what? You couldn't read it yourself? Fine, give it here a moment."
7994,Ah well. I'll keep looking for someone. Thanks anyway.
7996,Put your weapon away.
7997,Mind you don't put out that candle on the hearth upstairs!
7998,Fine by me.
8004,"Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to..."
8008,He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.
8014,"If that's what you want. I'll see you there, soon."
8016,"The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck."
8019,"Ah, yes. There was an incident, wasn't there?"
8020,What? Who are you? How did you get this far?
8022,"You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect... for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake."
8023,"First, I'll need to grab hold of your soul."
8024,"Don't mind the dogs, they get anxious when they haven't had dinner."
8025,The White-Gold Concordat. Our treaty with the Elves after the Great War forbids free worship of Talos.
8026,"We send you to plant some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself."
8028,You should talk to Ainethach if you have business with the mine. Not that there's much these days.
8029,"No, not right now. Maybe later, if I'm still upset."
8031,"Esbern, if the Empire could even acknowledge the Blades existence, we'd all have reason to celebrate."
8035, 
8038,Never seen the guy so angry. Better help him out any way you can.
8043,Well said.
8044,You there. What do you know about this?
8045,I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer.
8047,"Been about eight years now. I used to be a mercenary, but one trip to Ravenscar Hollow cured me of that."
8048,And he's not just any dragon. He was the right hand of Alduin.
8050,Ugh. Speak to my husband if you must.
8051,The rebels have agreed to cease hostilities until we hash out this treaty. Suffice it to say I'm not holding my breath.
8052,Uh... why don't we talk about this later?
8055,I'm afraid you'll have to come back later. I've been given strict instructions that no one be allowed to trouble Lady Elisif.
8058,"These old ruins... They don't want us here, the ancient ones. Better left alone."
8059,What are you talking about?
8061,"What...? Whoever did this, you're dead. You hear me? Dead!"
8064,"For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard."
8065,Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take precedence over our mission. My apologies.
8066,"Here, this is all can afford to give you as compensation. Hope it's enough."
8067,Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return.
8075,"Don't talk to me, defiler."
8078,"Reldith is the hardest-working farmer in Rorikstead, but I'm the one with a head for business."
8080,"I'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you. Good luck."
8081,I'll be amazed if we find anything useful here.
8082,"I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful."
8084,Ari gave me this dagger when we first started hunting together. Always said it brought her luck. You should be the one to carry it now.
8085,Of course. But why not let him go in first?
8089,Yes. Are you enjoying our little walk together? Or perhaps you'd like to come back when the Lady is taking visitors?
8091,Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll.
8092,What's happening? No! Leave me alone!
8095,"No, mother. The execution will proceed as planned."
8096,Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room.
8100,Hello Bolli. How's the fishing?
8102,Your outfit is something of an open wound... where attire is concerned.
8103,"Now go, leave me to my work."
8105,"Okay, now don't move at all."
8106,That's it! That's my bow!
8117,"You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions... you do what we say, when we say."
8120,"I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's move on."
8121,He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he's trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. I really hope he does.
8126,"Thank you, ma'am. Go right in."
8131,Oh no! I couldn't. Mother says they are a burden we must bear for our gift.
8132,Aww. I thought you were done with it.
8133,"Jarl Balgruuf? I don't mean to be disrespectful, as he's ruled Whiterun Hold well for years, but he seems in over his head now."
8135,Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
8143,Better to stick together down here.
8146,"All right, so Cicero attacked that harlot, Astrid! But what's a fool to do, when his mother is slandered and mocked? Surely the Listener understands!"
8147,"Now, we begin the ritual..."
8154,I'll... I'll go speak to Fastred. Post-haste!
8155,And a whole lot of good that's gotten us. 
8157,"About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard."
8161,"The problem is that it'll be a little difficult to acquire, seeing as how it's in the hands of someone who isn't exactly friendly."
8163,Live a life worth telling about.
8166,"Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks."
8167,"You go if you want to. I've never seen bones this large, and want to make sure I remember them so I can tell the story right."
8168,It's not that easy. She'd go to the Jarl if she knew I was even remotely involved. You have to get it to her some other way.
8173,"Come, taste darkness's embrace!"
8175,"Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes."
8180,"My uncle Dengeir was Jarl until a short time ago. His old age and failing health caught up with him, and he stepped down."
8183,There are ruined sewer tunnels beneath the city. The only way I know how to get in there is through a door off of the canal.
8185,Wagh!
8186,Take us!
8189,May you walk on warm sands.
8191,"Sir, we really must talk."
8196,I see.
8197,A Dreth never forgets a traitor. You'll pay for this!
8199,But it is all of you who are the true heroes!
8200,Use Dragonrend! It is the only chance to defeat him!
8202,But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar.
8204,"See, my grandfather was a wizard. My father wouldn't talk about him much. But I found some of his things in the attic. Including this staff."
8206,"""By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old."""
8207,The resulting disaster would reflect quite poorly on everyone involved. Are you following me?
8212,"Yes, Grelod."
8214,That door up ahead... looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.
8216,"So we grab it and we get out, right?"
8221,"The Empire is man's last bastion. If Ulfric wasn't blinded by lust for power, he'd see we are on the same side."
8223,Morrowind of course. Any Dunmer worth their weight in ash would tell you the same.
8224,"There's some trouble in Falkreath. There's always some sort of trouble down there, but now it's come to a head."
8229,Eh. I try not to trouble myself with stories of the outside world. 
8236,For some reason they just throw their lawbreakers out into the sea and think that ends the problem.
8239,"Our actions have always been one in the same; both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end."
8240,"Old lady Maiden-Loom owns the stables. But my father and me, we run things."
8243,I can't wait to see what the future brings.
8244,Damn Imperial arrogance!
8248,"First off, there's an Orc hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with."
8249,What? What is it?
8250,"Okay, look. If I'm caught saying anything bad about the meadery or the family, I'm a dead man."
8251,"Yes! Yes! You see, you know but you refuse to understand!"
8253,"In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it. I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase."
8256,I just wanted to know if you needed anything.
8257,Try putting your hands on the altar. Maybe Mehrunes Dagon will speak to you.
8258,"Without two keys, it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies."
8259,It's surprising the Council is allowing a Nord rule Riften under the Imperial flag. That can't be their first choice.
8264,Try not to get carried away.
8267,The ivory produced by those beasts is as hard as iron. But the giants have found ways to make it yield.
8269,"I studied there myself. Had to leave over a misunderstanding with a headmistress. Well, more a misunderstanding with her husband."
8270,"When that time comes, you shall take his place as my emissary. What say you?"
8274,Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.
8276,Alduin mahlaan
8277,I'll give you money. Treasure. I have some things hidden away. Take them all. They're yours. Just please... stop.
8279,I prefer a good roast duck. But your soup will do.
8282,"If you want to lead this pack when I'm gone, you have to see farther. Look closer."
8283,I think we can all profit from the situation in which we find ourselves.
8285,By the Eight... you actually got your hands on it! This alone is worth more than some thieves earn in a lifetime.
8287,You must be the one Falk spoke so highly of. Welcome.
8291,"You have seen the young, fickle love of youth, and helped a more seasoned love find its way. "
8293,Booooo.
8297,Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere. Never forget that...  I trust you gave them a thrashing? Now then...
8300,I feel better already.
8306,"""...Jarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim."""
8309,"All right, that's enough. Let's return to our business please."
8311,"I'm fine, Madena."
8312,"Well, I'm just surprised the Gourmet is a Redguard. I had you pegged for a Wood Elf, honestly. You know, because of your use of..."
8313,"Hello, friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
8314,"The streets are safer now, thanks to you."
8317,Over by the tree!
8318,"It's for Marise, but don't say a word to her!"
8319,I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that battlefield. I need you there.
8320,I don't think I like where this is going.
8321,Constance!
8322,Alduin cannot ignore this for long.
8324,"You will kill. You will kill, or you will die!"
8326,You keep saying that. What if she's gone forever? What if they've done something to her?
8328,"Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?"
8334,Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.
8337,I'm one of the last members of the Blades.
8346,"They are, but your mind has to be sharp, too."
8347,"Just between you and me, I wouldn't mind if the Empire just up and left for good."
8350,Come by the Winking Skeever any time you want to hear a tune.
8356,"Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment."
8358,"These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts."
8359,"Did I hear correctly, Thonar? Is your brother really asking you to settle another dispute between Mulush and Nepos?"
8364,"Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place."
8365,"Ha, found you!"
8366,You treat us fairly. Thank you.
8367,I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
8368,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
8372,"This is the last warning. You do it again, and you'll be sleeping in Beggar's Row with the rest of the riff-raff!"
8375,"Good, my experiments are at a critical stage and these are just what I need to finish. Here's some coin for all the trouble."
8377,"We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do."
8378,Now let us see how quickly you can master your new Thu'um.
8382,"When the fighting began over the White-Gold Concordat, she ran off to join the Stormcloaks. She had her father's fire, how could I say no?"
8387,The Empire I remember never surrendered.
8389,Uh-oh.
8390,"Strange. According to history Solitude attacked Winterhold, but Aesgeir seems to be saying Olaf reacted. What do we say happened?"
8391,You win! I submit!
8393,"Come on, this way. I've seen the guards use it to get rid of bodies. It must lead somewhere."
8396,"You were helpful before. I have need of your help again, if you're willing."
8397,Don't touch anything!
8401,"I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is."
8407,Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.
8411,"The city's changed, friend. The Thieves Guild is on the rise... and they've got a firm foothold here in Whiterun."
8412,Would you like to buy a lady a drink?
8413,It's kind of dark in here.
8416,What did I tell you about snooping around my wards?
8417,The what of what? No. No idea.
8424,We need to get back to Jorrvaskr.
8425,Of course he cares. You just have to understand that your father was a soldier and he'll always be a soldier.
8426,Is it over?
8427,Can you believe it? Another pile of logs ruined.
8429,So Alva did it to get Hroggar for herself? I should have suspected her.
8432,That's... great news. I'd... I'd better go. Right now. Before they find me again. This is my chance.
8433,With the lighting of the effigy...
8434,Is that... fur? Coming out of your ears?
8438,Got nothing to say to strange folk.
8440,I hope you enjoy touring the museum. Just don't touch anything.
8446,"You do that, and I'll see what I can do about recruiting some new additions to our Family..."
8447,Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
8448,It's not safe out here! Return to your homes immediately!
8449,"The world's gone mad with sorcerers now, is that it?"
8455,No. Of course not. Just - don't let me down Cipius. 
8456,Rumor holds that the Aretino boy brought an assassin here. Sounds like nonsense to me.
8469,"Oh, I am well. I will be well. Well to be within the will inside the walls. "
8470,"Yes, son. We should try to capture it."
8472,No killin' or no pay. Remember that.
8473,May wisdom forever light your path.
8474,What now...
8475,"Here, I was saving this for a rainy day. Maybe now I can afford a few more for my people. Take it."
8479,Get over to Winterhold. We're mounting our final attack!
8481,I... am Lucien Lachance.
8483,You're naked!
8484,Quit your bellyaching. We've all got our problems.
8486,"Now more than ever, the world needs tales of heroism."
8489,Take care.
8490,"We're ready, Dragonborn, our wrath to unleash."
8491,"Oh, wait... did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies."
8495,"Good. Here you are. He'll follow you to Oblivion and back, if it comes to that."
8496,"Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway."
8497,"We were supposed to be rich by now, you know. Thorgar insisted we'd be swimming in gold."
8501,"Don't worry, the Eight are watching over us. I hope."
8502,There was a great battle here in Whiterun. It was quite thrilling! I must compose a song about it someday.
8507,Before the Blades wiped them all out.
8511,"No, no... not at all. Mara believes that the spark of a union comes from inside us, not from our appearance."
8514,"Skyrim is now host to giant, flying lizards and two-legged cat-men... and you're surprised by me? Yes. I just talked. And am continuing to do so."
8515,"But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they?"
8516,Come on! Come on!
8520,"I am a part of you, little mortal. I am a shadow in your subconscious, a blemish on your fragile little psyche. You know me. You just don't know it. "
8523,"Some believed the mages were behind the whole thing, and others felt they could have at least prevented it."
8524,Thu'um wah Thu'um!
8526,"I visited the meaderies of Riften once, as a lad. Wish I had their skill."
8527,Nah...Kest!
8528,"I'm glad to know that, because I need your help. You see, I've lost something precious.  "
8532,I'll see you burn!
8534,"If this is about battle magic, forget it. I've told every Jarl I've served under that I won't...."
8538,"Trust me, we have nothing to say to one another."
8540,"Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milord?"
8541,The Poetic Edda is never truly complete. As a living history of Skyrim we Bards continually add parts to it.
8542,"If you don't mind, my patrons would appreciate it if you put the weapon away."
8543,You were just standing there when you were supposed to be serving drinks to our customers!
8544,The Thalmor happened. They've been hunting down every Blade they can find for the past thirty years.
8545,I have a letter here from Quintus Navale in Windhelm. He said it was urgent.
8548,Return my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.
8549,"Miss Stentor, watch your tongue in the Jarl's court!"
8550,Are you ready to go?
8552,Molag Bal. You think you can best Boethiah's faithful? I have won this contest before!
8553,I... see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more... specific explanation.
8554,"You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!"
8556,"Ah, you're back."
8557,"I'm telling you, it works. Let them ring their own ears on my shield, then scoop them up off the ground."
8560,"Aedra, what a day!"
8561,Is it that obvious? I should take pains to seem more happy. I wouldn't want to upset our host.
8563,But they don't say how he does this.
8567,No! Noooooooo!
8568,A traitor right up to the end.
8569,"It seems to be spreading from the southeast, down in the Jeralls near Riften. The one at Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds."
8572,"No, I don't think so. Respond to their request, and we'll leave it at that."
8573,We shouldn't have left her there to die!
8575,I need some things for the ship.
8581,"The situation here at your College is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed."
8582,We follow our hearts.
8588,"Let's just get inside, see what's in there."
8593,Would you happen to be headed towards Darkwater Crossing?
8594,"In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but given the circumstances I think he'd approve."
8595,Elisif...
8597,I thought it was strange that Aringoth stopped coming into town. I suppose he's having some difficulties out there.
8602, 
8603,Do you think me a fool? Do you think I'm too stupid to make the connection? You've ruined my work!
8604,Which brings me to my present concern.
8612,(panting)
8613,We are the rightful rulers of Markarth!
8616,"Woah there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed."
8620,"There's a chill in the air. Ysmir's beard, it gets colder in here every day."
8627,"Yes, Grelod."
8628,Wait until the boys hear about this.
8631,Lead the way.
8633,"Thank you for coming, brother."
8634,Where are you?
8635,"It's my wife, Fjola!  I think she's being held in this tower."
8636,Any of them! Just hurry up! No time for a debate when customers are thirsty!
8641,"Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth without a fight."
8642,"I will grant you my understanding of Clear Skies. This is your final gift from us, Dragonborn. Use it well."
8646,"I heard Lucan yelling the other day about a thief breaking into his store. It wasn't me, honest!"
8647,Hmph. Fine. Go on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach knows more than you think.
8648,"I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the woman we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn."
8649,"I'm thinking of composing a song about you, Jonna. Would you prefer that I proclaim your beauty, your strength, your..."
8652,We'll have our freedom. One day.
8657,"Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent scholar on Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always willing to pass on his knowledge."
8661,"At this time, there is no indication that either group is aware of the other's correspondence. "
8664,My problem with her? She's the one who has a problem with me!
8665,This giant... It's not the only thing in Fallowstone Cave. Getting to it isn't going to be easy.
8671,"I certainly hope so, otherwise I'm wasting my time."
8672,I will just... rest here a moment. Although it is damnably cold out here. I don't look forward to the trip back down...
8677,Of course it bothers me! I'm sure it's only a matter of time until they seize our mill in the name of their war effort.
8678,"Pfft. You'd think an emperor would fetch at least twice that. Damn that motherless cheapskate, Motierre."
8687,"Damn, just as I was getting warmed up."
8689,Hold on. This can get a bit tricky.
8690,That important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.
8697,Speak with Amaund Motierre at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He will know the true Emperor's location.
8700,A kill you must repay.
8701,"Fine. Take them and be gone. Never return here, or else you'll face my full wrath."
8702,Let's not waste any time.
8703,Looking for the best smith in Skyrim? You found it.
8705,"With all due respect, Listener, you broke what few rules we seem to have. Nazir insists you talk to him and work this issue out."
8706,"Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me."
8709,"Oh, and Legate. It's been an honor to have you at my side. As a token of my appreciation, I want you to keep my sword."
8713,"Oh, you wanted the attic room? Why didn't you say so the first time?"
8715,"I'm seeking a small list of items to complete my next creation: two flawless sapphires, a mammoth tusk and a chunk of gold ore."
8716,"...not dead? Kill them, kill them all!"
8717,"To be sure, my lord, I am not skilled in the arts of war or military tactics."
8719,"I'm going to make this short and sweet, because frankly I don't think you deserve another shot."
8723,"A bit melodramatic, even for you Laila."
8726,I thought adventurers were supposed to look tough?
8730,"I don't know. When I asked her where she was going she just muttered ""Where the end began."""
8731,Move along.
8734,Oh you poor thing! Come by the temple and my husband and I will keep you fed.
8735,"That we have forgotten them, this I fear the gods will remember."
8737,"If you wondering why they call me Vipir the Fleet, watch me outrun the town guard sometime."
8740,"But what you must understand about Falkreath is that our town is defined, for better or wrose, by the large and ancient cemetery here."
8743,Let's just say I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye and leave it at that.
8744,These days? Aye. Most of what I make is for folk like you.
8751,"I'm on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Azura, the Goddess of Twilight. If you'll excuse me."
8754,"Soon enough we will march on Solitude. And on that day the heroes of Sovngarde will march with us, and the Empire will fall to its knees in fear."
8756,And then there's a tiny problem with a giant that's been raiding our supply caravans... You heard me right. A giant. Need to put a stop to that.
8757,"Someone actually interested in what I'm doing? Amazing! Well, allow me to explain."
8763,"So... once again the Key has been stolen and a ""champion"" returns it to the Sepulcher."
8767,What's the matter with you? You want to start a blaze?
8768,The Dark Mistress? She sent you? Wait. Molag Bal's altar. Of course. 
8770,Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.
8771,Don't leave me here!
8778,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
8779,"Hmm... If you happen to recollect anything about the incident, you be sure to report to the captain of the guard."
8780,"The two of us, living together. I'll see you at home!"
8786,"By Sithis, what a mess. I guess this is the end."
8789,We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
8791,I told you to go away. I'm not opening this door for anybody!
8793,Agh!
8794,"Not much, to be honest. Their return was a shock to us all. Giraud Gemane has some tomes about them in the library, if you're interested."
8799,"My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your Grace."
8801,Ysgramor himself wouldn't have the patience to deal with all the rabble around here.
8802,"You have chosen wisely. Lead on, and I shall follow."
8804,Is there anything on the claw that might show how to open this door?
8805,Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!
8806,This really isn't turning out the way I'd hoped.
8809,No one can doubt that you truly are Dragonborn.
8811,"Drennen, you do understand that the Lexicon at the bottom of this place holds the accumulated memories of centuries of Dwemer."
8813,So he has been punished? And what of us? What fate shall we suffer?
8816,It feels good to finally have a chance to help these people. Helplessly watching them suffer's been difficult.
8818,Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me.
8820,"If we could make contact with them, they could provide an excellent way to inconspicuously transport goods for us."
8821,"I'll see you there, then."
8824,You gave us even more trouble than Farkas did at his first turning.
8828,We can trade when there's light outside.
8829,Whenever you are.
8833,"For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose."
8834,You saved us all. We will sing of you forever.
8837,I'm just one of the miners. I don't want any trouble.
8839,"After you, Dragonborn."
8840,"Oh yeah, and what would you rather do?"
8841,You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind.
8844,You're a dead man!
8846,No doubt he thought it was the only way to make his point. And also because he knew he could.
8854,Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! You already found it! You are cut from a different cloth than the usual brutes the Jarl foists on me.
8855,"Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?"
8856,You're going to pay!
8857,"That was better Ataf. Add a bit of emphasis on ""Ragnar"" and ""Red."""
8861,Enough. Let's go.
8869,"Sell-swords are common in Skyrim, but you'll find precious few as stout and as a strong as I am."
8870,"Well, I... "
8879,"Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster."
8880,It's good that Sorli has finally been given some real authority.
8888,You do Kyne proud. Only one challenge remains. Go and defeat the troll champion.
8890,Grragh!
8891,"You can use the North Gate to enter the city, or you can hit the road. Your choice."
8902,Make yourself at home.
8904,"Let's go our separate ways now, hmm?"
8916,Another quiet day.
8917,"There's only the pommel left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?"
8919,We're causing no trouble. All we ask is to look for her.
8924,It's time to decide.
8929,"You're passing through Solitude? Maybe you're looking to make some easy gold, yes?"
8930,"Please, excuse my ignorance.  Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival. You should proceed to the kitchens straight away."
8931,"Come on, think about it. She'd reward us!"
8933,There's been talk amongst the guards. That you are... Dragonborn. But such a thing... Surely that's not possible...
8935,"Know about them? Lad, you're looking at them."
8937,"Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know."
8941, 
8942,"Not many Nords would work for a Reachman, but Ainethach is a good man."
8946,Ah. I believe I can be of help here.
8947,Let's teach these bastards a lesson.
8955,"By the love of the Nine, what is it with you sycophants and hangers on? The jarl is busy! And so am I, for that matter."
8958,Nord beast! Both your life and lands are now forfeit!
8959,"Of course, my dear. It may prove to be quite the curiosity! One must always be alert."
8965,You've done well by restoring our Festival.
8972,Nothing but the best. Black-Briar Mead... fresh from the vat.
8973,"Oh, no. I hadn't heard from Gorm for a while, so I'd hoped he'd given up on his little scheme."
8975,"Ah yes, excellent samples. Thank you. This coin should compensate you for all the bother."
8976,Ainethach is dead. What will happen to Karthwasten now?
8977,"I don't recognize you, but I sense that you're one of us. Who are you?"
8979,"Although it would benefit the Guild more than you can imagine, in the end, it would do more harm than good."
8981,"At least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous marauders. And the third owner, Jorgen, I only know he lives in Morthal."
8984,Yaaaargh!
8985,You heard of Ravenscar Hollow? Cave on the island to the west. Place is a roost for those foul Hagravens.
8986,And don't think for a moment I've forgotten it was you that lost us the hold in the first place.
8995,I can see the battle-lust in your eyes. Doom will surely come to any who cross your path.
9001,Always a pleasure...
9006,"I know, master. Don't say such things -- there is always time."
9008,Hurry!
9009,I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....
9012,"Oh my, I very nearly got us both into a nasty predicament, didn't I?"
9014,Wow! Then I could dive into a river and swim so far away that Britte and father could never find me.
9015,You have the honor of addressing a member of the Thalmor. Bask in it.
9016,"Well, as it turns out, I had a pet skeever when I was a boy and he used to wink."
9019,"You're the one that got out of Helgen, aren't you? I could use anyone who's tangled with a dragon before."
9022,"I can't find my Alembic. I suppose I could use another one, but... well, it sounds silly, but mine has sentimental value."
9024,This bears closer inspection. I'd like to stay a while and examine this.
9025,I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn.
9028,You've no time to glory in your accomplishments.
9029,Need a dagger? No? How about a claymore?
9033,Don't kid yourself... stone runs in our blood.
9036,I'll see you in pieces!
9038,Oh... thank you. I don't understand what's happening. I can't stay here. What will I do now?
9043,"You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother."
9047,I want you to finish that job in Whiterun first. Then we'll talk about more work.
9048,You won't even live to regret this!
9049,A citizen of Skyrim has been kidnapped.
9050,Good luck.
9055,Wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my idiot sister.
9056,"Ooohhhh, ahhhrrrghhhh... uuuuggghhh."
9058,Of course.
9065,"We've decided this will be your Trial. Do well, and you'll be counted among the Companions."
9068,He did? That's... I'm surprised. 
9069,Rexus. The items.
9073,"No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the exact liquid the priests would drink."
9074,"Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry."
9078,Dovahkiin los ok dovahkriid
9080,"Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes."
9081,"Captain, captain!"
9085,"Sorry, Tythis. I'll get it to you somehow."
9086,"Hail, Ilfhild."
9087,"But first, tell me. Why's a foreigner want to fight for Skyrim?"
9092,"The College is a place where we can focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us."
9099,"I don't know exactly what's going on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some fluke, or what. But what we now have before us..."
9102,"Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life."
9109,Oh Listener. Can't you see that's impossible?
9111,Which is utterly useless at the moment. You need to fill it with a soul.
9115,"I can't, Valindor. It won't let me go. It's taking over my life."
9119,"Hey, Breton. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
9126,You're... dead!
9129,Skyrim's mountains were still infested with dragons. One of the early Nord kings caught a dragon and kept it in Dragonsreach.
9131,"The College would agree with you, but do you have any idea how many innocent lives were cut short, just so Azura could have revenge?"
9134,"Oh, good, more of those."
9135,"Oh, yes! Quite! So many important people from all across Skyrim."
9138,We should keep moving.
9139,Coward. Come out and fight me!
9143,I serve Jarl Baalgruuf as steward.
9144,Foul blood drinker!
9146,Do you hate the dark elves? Are you here to bully us and tell us to leave?
9150,"Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes."
9151,Not my problem.
9153,Nice touch about the High King.
9158,I can't believe my mother's gone. Now what'll I do?
9160,Follow me.
9161,"Good morning, wife."
9162,"What a fascinating time to be alive! Mark me, these days will be remembered long after we're gone."
9167,"Oh no. No, no, no. This can't be happening."
9169,"You're tougher than you look. You got me, fair and square."
9175,"Zu'u Odahviing. Call me when you have need, and I will come if I can."
9177,I'll be the one asking the questions.
9179,Keep turning down jobs like this and the Guild will begin to lose respect for you.
9180,Oh.
9181,Wow! I'm see through!
9186,So they don't like us either. 
9187,"What I do, I do for Skyrim and her people."
9191,I will wait.
9193,"For a century or more, the Thalmor had been picking away at the Empire. Valenwood was the first, then the province of Elsweyr."
9194,Yeeaahh! There.
9196,I wish your mother were still alive. She could answer you much better. Let me think on it and we'll talk later.
9199,I don't dare go back in now. I'll just have to hope that in the confusion he can slip out.
9204,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
9205,That damn fool! I should ring her neck!
9206,"I'm really afraid of Grelod. When Aventus escaped, she was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. "
9209,Mara will always accept into her arms should you seek return to her fold.
9210,"10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Prepared or not, I'm coming!"
9219,I... I don't know. What's wrong?
9220,I've got your back.
9222,They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.
9224,"But, I will honor your request. The gods know of your victories, and they themselves will glory in your deeds."
9228,Get away from me.
9229,"Once she's with child, I will not harm her."
9230,Your perseverance will only lead you to disappointment.
9231,"You try and set one foot in this yard, and I'll cut it off."
9236,What is it nephew? Can't you see I'm trying to think here?
9238,What brings you out to Shor's Stone?
9240,"Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name across his network of contacts."
9242,"Oh come now, what's a dragon or two compared to a day full of fishing!"
9244,"Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take Him in."
9248,"It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an amulet that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to Enthir."
9252,I hope to see you in Windhelm. Good luck.
9257,No!
9263,But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target.  
9266,Ulfric and General Tullius are both just waiting for me to make a wrong move.
9268,Would you be so kind as to deliver the frost salts for me? I'm sure Arcadia will provide some form of recompense...
9270,The bloodiest beef in the Reach.
9272,"When I was young, I favored huge swords, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good hammer."
9275,Vampires are utter abominations. We need to do everything in our power to destroy them.
9277,"Yes. You're right. If they needed to die so that Dawnstar could live, then it was worth the price."
9282,I moved here from Helgen after my family was killed.
9289,"Ah, indeed. Well there's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. I'm sure you'll manage, though."
9290,"We're the best damned fighters in Skyrim. At least, some of us are. "
9291,Didn't have a coin to spend between our entire family. Ate the same slop we fed our livestock.
9292,"Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you."
9293,Is she... dead?
9295,"But a single candle can banish the darkness of the entire Void. If not you, then someone else. "
9296,You won't leave Skyrim alive!
9298,You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate this treaty and I would be recalled.
9301,I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
9303,I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was gone.
9311,And... you'll take care of it?
9312,Damn addicts always stealing from me.
9313,"That may be, but what of the war? That is not so easy to escape from."
9314,How do you manage to hold your ground like that?
9315,And the Whispering Lady.
9318,"Ah, you see? That wasn't so hard, now was it? Let's the two of us just forget we ever met, hmm?"
9321,"Ah, but Skyrim! Skyrim is supreme among all nations! Our people, our native people, are unmatched in all Tamriel!"
9323,They're beautiful. I can see why he wanted to find them.
9326,"He'll be fine, I just hate worrying about his worrying."
9329,Not so sure of yourself after all? 
9330,"Nothing refreshes the soul like an honest day's labor in good, tilled earth."
9334,"Please, make it brief. We have much to do."
9335,Yeagh!
9337,Who among you can help me?
9341,Reyda! You saw Reyda? Did you tell her Narfi cries? Did you tell her Narfi never said goodbye like mother and father?
9342,So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!
9347,"If you ever think of throwing meat at me, I will have you dragged off to Cidhna Mine so fast the guards will yank those filthy arms of yours off."
9349,Don't go to Kolskeggr. It's not safe.
9353,That has to be the most brilliant and unexpected solution I've heard in a long time. It solves all of my problems and keeps the field stable!
9355,"Now the Elves dictate everything we do, and they don't want us acknowledging a ""mere human"" like Talos as the god he is."
9357,Hsss
9358,The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.
9366,Certainly a few of my colleagues aren't quite as talented as they'd like to believe.
9367,"If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at the Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate."
9369,Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.
9370,"Hello, Lady Mjoll."
9373,I'm not from here. I'm a sellsword. These are my men.
9374,I'm just another Forsworn sent to rot here in this mine.
9377,A new supplicant approaches.
9378,"Dragons, pah. They can be killed. The Blades killed many in their early days as dragon-slayers."
9384,"And he is no fool. Ni mey, rinik gut nol. Far from it. He began as the wisest and most far-seeing of us all."
9385,You have my gratitude. That spider had been interfering with my excavations for months.
9387,Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side. He wants to meet with you right away.
9391,We've got to find someplace to hide!
9393,Dir volaan!
9394,"Before we enter, I must warn you about the dangers that could be lurking within."
9396,Oh! Oh... no... No!
9398,"Svana, I heard that Sibbi was put in jail. What happened?"
9399,"Eight septims per day, plus lodging."
9401,The cloying air in this place is almost unbearable.
9404,"Shahvee would be in your debt, kind one."
9406,"I told her it was a bad idea, that she wasn't cut out for what'd be necessary, but she wouldn't hear it."
9408,You got Aldis to tell you something? I knew you would. What did he say?
9410,Oh no you don't!
9412,More settlements have sent riders to say dragons are being spotted throughout Skyrim.
9413,"I could also do some good for a change. Sure, I'd go with you. "
9417,"First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above."
9421,Some layabout named Sabjorn.
9423,Isn't this something? Elenwen really knows how to host a party!
9425,"Want me to prove it? I bet a hundred gold I can take you, bare-handed."
9433,That's really none of your business...
9437,"Innocent? So was I, for the first one. The other murders were all me, though."
9440,"By the gods, no!"
9441,It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College.
9442,"You're testing my patience, but very well. I'll give you another chance."
9443,We're supposedly at peace now. But I put in to be stationed here to keep an eye on the Thalmor. I've a feeling they're behind this unrest in Skyrim.
9447,"Correct. It's a private place where I can catalog my research. Occasionally, the Jarl will come in and have questions, but that's thankfully rare."
9448,"I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it."
9450,How appropriate they should live in the Ratway with the rest of the trash.
9452,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
9455,"If I had it, I'd pay! There's no need to do that!"
9462,"I think the dragons are here to test us, and make sure we're still true Nords."
9464,"Maybe I'll show you one day, Madesi. Have them delivered to the Bunkhouse, won't you?"
9465,"To cling to something past its usefulness is unseemly, how much more so when that thing is you?"
9469,I was wondering if you still had many associates in the shipping profession.
9479,"The dwarves were very clever, tapping into and drawing power from the Heart of Lorkhan itself."
9480,Passing through on your way to High Hrothgar? About to make a delivery up there myself.
9485,"Lucan at the Riverwood Trader had his store broken into the other night. Oddly enough, barely anything's been stolen."
9488,Can you believe those pathetic Gray-Manes still show their face in public?
9495,"My... my what, now?"
9497,"Back to Markarth with you! Virane must be silenced! He's a potential witness, you witless dagger jabber!"
9498,"Madesi, what's this bill for 300 septims!"
9500,My wife Kerah runs our jewelry stall in the market.
9503,"Revyn put the word out to his suppliers but with the war on, tools are scarce. Both sides have been snapping them up."
9504,"What troubles you, my daughter?"
9507,"Please, ask him what she likes. It's my only chance."
9509,"I've already told you everything I know, I swear."
9512,Are you all right? What happened in there?
9513,"I know what you're thinking: ""This Belethor, how could he part with such magnificent treasures?"""
9519,"Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius needs to know I won't be pushed around."
9520,"Ah, my friend from Cidhna Mine. Hello."
9526,"Trust me, marsh-friend, you do not want to live in this city."
9531,"You can bring weapons in, but you can't use 'em in here. Got it?"
9538,"Then... there is hope after all. For so long, all I could do was watch our doom approach, helplessly."
9543,You just let me know what you need. I am at your beck and call.
9546,"Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear it."
9550,"Thorgar says we'll find rocks soon, the kind worth gold."
9551,You ready?
9558,Oh of course. My mistake.
9563,Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam... the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow.
9568,"Not here. Let's speak at my home, where we can be alone, unwatched."
9574,Too few remember to honor the god of the dead. Do not be one of those.
9578,"Oh certainly, dear sister. We couldn't afford to have our customers look like the simple pigs they are, now could we?"
9581,"Brynjolf want's this mark's head on a pike, but we'll settle for what the bastard's carryin' instead. Can I count on you? "
9582,Can you make some new poultices for my...you know?
9585,"Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth."
9586,Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme.
9587,"Die, insect!"
9595,"Thank you. Here, my father had a favorite sword and shield technique. Let me teach it to you, in honor of his memory."
9596,I've just learned not to trust luck around here.
9600,"Of course there's a collapse in trade, Raerek. The Stormcloaks stalk every road and harass every one of our patrols."
9605,It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.
9607,"In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power."
9612,I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be.
9616,I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a dragon in my palace.
9617,"Halt! You have no business here, outsider. Leave at once."
9620,Rinik vazah. An apt phrase. Alduin bovul. One reason I came to your call was to test your Thu'um for myself.
9623,So I've let him run his little Forsworn rebellion from inside Cidhna Mine. Now he's out of control.
9625,"The changes in Morthal are of little consequence to me. So long as the laws are upheld, I do not care who does the upholding."
9627,(bark)
9631,But I slashed him good. Pretty sure I severed an artery. Don't know what you're going to find in there... but you can probably just follow the blood.
9635,It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences us.
9641,Let's get this party started.
9642,"Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise, Dragonborn."
9644,Not only that but they're givin' us thieves a bad name by murderin' their marks.
9645,"Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?"
9647,"Oh, master. It's your time to do with as you please, but what about those who depend on you so much?"
9648,Not a chance. Not for this. You're going to the Cidhna Mine for the rest of your days.
9651,"I do hate to admit it, but if nothing else, all the fighting lately has been a complete blessing to this business."
9654,"That is the Necromancer's Amulet, of legend. "
9655,Don't be a silly girl! Running a bar's no job for a young lady.
9657,And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you get her back from that Giant.
9661,There you are!
9663,"You're taking us somewhere warm, I trust?"
9666,"Stand next to me, and prepare your Whirlwind Sprint. Master Borri will give the signal."
9670,Ugh!
9671,"So is it Riften or Rifton? This place has changed its name so many times, I can't even remember."
9674,"The Jarl has put out a bounty on the dragon that's been terrorizing the countryside. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
9685,"It would seem that you have yet to reach a level of skill that the College would find valuable, so I'm afraid I can't allow you to join at this time."
9686,You could have just asked.
9688,"Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess."
9689,Wolf Queen. Hear our call and awaken. We summon Potema!
9692,"Now don't get cross with me, but the officials are demanding compensation for the mark you killed. Had to do it... had no choice, boss."
9699,You're just getting older.
9704,Of course I'm sure! She was asking about Esbern.
9705,"As you can see, Eldergleam's roots are large and stretch far, blocking any path to her trunk."
9706,"I'll prove it to you, all right? I'll get you the letter. Just... meet me at the statue of Talos, and don't tell anyone about this."
9707,Any luck finding the Butcher?
9711,"Sadly, the Oblivion Crisis took its toll on Winterhold, in more ways than one. Then, the Great Collapse swallowed most of our beloved city."
9712,"Got horses that need shoeing, so make it quick."
9717,"Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are."
9720,"My children, Sibbi and Ingun, are being groomed to run the family business one day as well."
9721,"If you locate her, find us in Rorikstead."
9722,"And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King once and for all. "
9724,"You're going to get it, Sissel!"
9728,How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard.
9729,"We surrender. The capital is yours. If you pledge no harm will come of my people, I turn over the seat of power to you."
9731,"Alright, let's move, men! We've got more..."
9732,"Since then, they've been working to weaken the Empire any way they can."
9736,"Looks like we weren't the first ones here, either."
9737,Of course! You can't make good mead without happy honey!
9743,Hey! Don't do that.
9744,Were you? The hubris of the Blades truly knows no bounds.
9745,"Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you."
9748,I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.
9749,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
9750,"Pickings may be a bit slim today, but if you see anything you like I'll make you a good deal."
9752,She always said composure was the key to a successful archer.
9753,You do not remember the Daedric Lord of the Orcs? The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse?
9754,"Oh! You behave, now!"
9757,"I just cook, and clean, and do whatever it is they ask of me."
9759,I'm cutting your pay for this job.
9761,"You'd better give me five septims right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose..."
9769,"This isn't the military, son. There are no ranks. "
9770,I knew we could count on you! Glad to have you back on our side.
9771,"Please be careful, I don't wish to be the reason for your death."
9772,Someone's going to get hurt.
9774,"You know, I was thinking of expanding the herb garden. Make room for some new plants I'm planning."
9775,Damn it! Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
9777,We want compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
9779,I'm not looking for conversation.
9781,"I do. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the Forsworn, back when that was possible."
9782,Dragons? You want to go out and fight dragons? Are you completely off your nut?
9787,I don't have them anymore. She took them... The Caller. She's the one who put me in here!
9790,Wuld...
9791,"Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got."
9792,Just get out of here.
9796,Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments or grow back that missing limb with my genuine Falmerblood Elixir!
9799,"Oh, hello there. I didn't expect to see you here."
9800,"You think I don't know that? If anyone learned of this meeting, my corpse would swing over Solitude for a decade!"
9801,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
9807,For the Emperor!
9812,"I'm impressed. Forsworn usually make short work of mercenaries, but you took care of them. Here is your reward. "
9814,"Small blade. Easy to hide. I mean, sure, you could just swing a pickaxe into someone's face, but people tend to see that coming."
9817,"In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly."
9821,You can't take that!
9822,I'm waiting.
9825,"We'll make it, Greta. We always have so far..."
9829,"That's what many here wanted. A quiet life in a quiet place, without the noise or the trouble of a city."
9832,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Hjaalmarch. Congratulations."
9833,Skyrim is filled with all manner of dangerous beasts.
9834,"The catch was, he had to head out there with our wood. So not only is Leifnarr gone, but a good bit of our supplies as well."
9837,"Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive."
9839,"I don't like being made a fool of, Brand-Shei. Not one bit."
9842,Welcome to the Midden.
9844,The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
9845,"This stronghold respects strength, and strength alone."
9846,I'm still pretty sore and can't really walk too far without having to rest for a while.
9850,The very thought breaks my heart.
9851,Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.
9852,Yol!
9853,It's our honor to have you there. 
9854,Do you not know the Daedric Lord of the Hunt? 
9857,"You're right, dear. I'm sorry to worry you."
9859,"Hello, Silana. Would you like an apple?"
9860,Solitude's famous for it's Bards College. Worth a visit if you've never been. Some of them can sing just as pretty as a lark.
9863,"What are you hiding, priest?"
9869,I hope I can count on you if I ever need a favor.
9871,My debt is repaid at last.
9873,I love a good fight!
9882,The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.
9889,"This marvelous object. It practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt before."
9890,"I spit on you, dead sister."
9891, 
9892,Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
9898,Onmund gave up the first time I said no. But not you... 
9899,"Their whole lives were consumed with hatred for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this Shout."
9906,"This land is riven by war, and her people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged."
9908,You ought to cover your... unmentionables.
9910,"Now, if you'll please follow me, I'll show you the living quarters."
9912,"Markarth is... different from the rest of Skyrim, there's no doubt about that. "
9915,You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!
9921,"Try to find out where their fortress is. The captain, Stig Salt-Plank, has to know something."
9925,"You were with us on the carts, weren't you? Not your lucky day, eh?"
9927,"Come on, this way."
9929,"Ha! You can't resist, can you?"
9933,I've never seen Mjoll this upset about anything. The city really gets to her.
9938,As usual. I've always got an eye on the rocks.
9940,"It's not much, but we get by."
9941,"I hate those damn things. Too many eyes, you know?"
9943,I knew I could trust you!
9945,I'll meet you at the shrine.
9947,Indeed. That would be best.
9948,"So, he wants to take my city, walls intact."
9950,"The College is always searching for more of Shalidor's writings in an attempt to understand both our knowledge of the man, and of magic in general."
9953,Something's wrong... Boss' been down there too long.
9954,"I signed on 'cause I couldn't watch the Stormcloaks tearing everything apart and not do something. But, most of my family disagrees with my choice."
9960,"I'm just trying to have a quiet drink here, all right?"
9961,Blackreach... why does that sound so familiar?
9962,You need to meet with him and give him whatever you think you can't live without while you're inside the embassy.
9963,"I'm sorry to wake you, my Brother. I have a request from Orchendor."
9964,I'm the commander of the guard here in Whiterun.
9965,Aha.
9969,Uglarz is a great huntress. Perhaps she can teach me something new.
9970,Hroggar's house fire? Aye. He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
9972,Incredible... imagine the manpower and ingenuity needed to carve the buildings of Markarth.
9974,A family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth.
9976,"But it was Ulfric. And he did kill the High King, in honorable combat. My brother refused to allow the the Imperials to take revenge for the deed."
9977,"I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me."
9978,"It doesn't matter what I believe. Nurelion does, and it might be the only thing keeping him alive right now."
9980,Get up to Winterhold. We're going to take it back.
9983,"Why, you don't think I could do it?"
9984,Would it be foolish to stop for a while and light a fire? I suppose it would.
9986,"As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts. Thane Erikur, you have a strong head for business. What do you suggest?"
9987,I don't know how those cozy lords manage to drag themselves out of bed every day. Why bother if you're not living?
9992,"And finally, there's the matter of the Patronage that Elisif wanted me to give you."
9993,The blue thing? But even the simplest harmonic field is composed of entirely...
9994,A Septim? As in... a gold coin? Really?
9996,You're the best! Can you be my mother?
9999,"Well, I was thinking sir, with the war going on and all. Maybe, I could enlist? Fight the Imperials?"
10002,The stone structure the Dwarves have left makes us invincible. Let the dragons singe a few carpets. They'll never topple Markarth.
10003,"At this rate, we won't last more than a few more seasons at best. Then I'll just have to sell the old place."
10004,We need to pass through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder.
10005,"If you see Reyda, tell her that Narfi misses her and to come home soon... very soon. Soon... soon, like the moon!"
10006,Then stop wasting my time.
10011,I can take you!
10016,You have been warned.
10017,I import books  whenever I can. Most Nord works are too bawdy and violent for my tastes.
10021,Lead the way.
10023,"Leave me be, Imperial. I haven't got anything to say to you."
10024,"I can't take it anymore, Tythis. Indaryn keeps pushing me around and I'm not even doing anything wrong."
10026,Have you ever seen what a bear does to the trees? They jump up on their hind legs and scratch them to bits... marking their territory or something.
10027,Hey!
10028,"How goes the begging today, Brenuin?"
10030,"I'm keeping Arnleif and Sons going, as best I can."
10031,I suggest you aim elsewhere.
10034,"I suppose I would, but you're the only one who gets that greeting."
10036,"Nothing to do now but sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip home."
10038,Good. I'm spread thin. I could use the help.
10040,"Ah well, it was a long shot."
10047,"The Greybeards have called a peace council, at High Hrothgar. And can you believe it - both Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius have agreed to go."
10048,"There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of."
10050,"Think hard about your loyalties, brother. I expected better from you."
10051,I'll give you a week before you end up dead in a ditch.
10053,We'd better stick together down here.
10055,"The Eye of Talos was a fine ship, once. Now it lies wrecked, off an island just north of here."
10057,"A healer named Jouane saved my life. He's been my closest friend ever since. I tell you, that man is a miracle worker."
10058,Not now.
10065,Feels good to be mining again.
10066,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
10069,That's what scares me. I'm afraid I'll travel to Darkwater Crossing and find it burned to the ground.
10073,You Bards don't cut each other any slack do you?
10074,"I will return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary immediately, Listener."
10075,"If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you, Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose."
10079,"Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor my end of the bargain."
10080,Nonsense. You and your friend are welcome to stay here as long as you need to.
10081,Scourge of nature!
10082,Empty your pockets or end up as skeever food.
10084,Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.
10085,I've never liked having the Imperials right on Windhelm's doorstep. Retaking Winterhold would help secure our supply lines...
10087,"We're nothing to the Daedra. Pawns to move around, praise, and punish as they see fit."
10090,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
10091,You really shouldn't be in here.
10095,"So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous."
10097,Any luck with Sapphire?
10101,Silus comes from one of the oldest families in Dawnstar. They have a complicated history.
10103,"Now that's good work. Everyone will be a lot safer with them gone, Dark Elf and Nord alike."
10105,"Of course... otherwise it wouldn't be much of a reward, now would it?"
10109,Are you still here?
10112,Not here. I told you to meet me in Riverwood.
10113,"Well, I'd better get to work. I have to fix another saw blade for Gerdur's mill."
10114,Good work. Get ready while I have a word with our favorite outsider.
10115,Thank you again for resolving my... problem.
10116,"Knowledge of truly powerful Illusion spells is here at the College, but it is hidden from those who might misuse it."
10120,We will see if you truly have the gift.
10124,Our son Leontius moved to Old Hroldan nearly 30 years ago. I still miss him.
10127,"Have you heard of the Blessing of Dibella? It can help you with the wooing of women, if that's your aim."
10128,"Five, four, three, two, one... go!"
10129,"If it's a fight you want, I'm ready this time."
10132,You are worthy. The knowledge is yours.
10133,Sounds like easy money to me. You're on.
10134,"These priests weren't threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated."
10135,"I assume everyone's gone ahead of us as planned. I just swept through the castle, no one's here. "
10137,"Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs of him being this, what, ""Dragonborn."""
10140,I have letters to read.
10143,Ulfric... what have you done my old friend?
10145,"Be brief Imperial, there's only so long I can stand being downwind of your stench."
10146,Hold your thoughts 'til after we untangle this mess.
10147,Lead on.
10151,"Are you complaining? Work. If you have strength to whine, you have strength to smelt."
10154,Thanks. I only wish Lucan was here to see this again.
10162,"By Shor, what do you want?"
10163,"I can't thank you enough. Here, take this. It's not much, but please accept it as a token of my thanks."
10166,"If you're looking for a room, try the Bee and Barb. This place is for the working man."
10167,"If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous locations."
10170,There's enough real troubles in the world without making new ones up.
10174,His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
10175,This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century.
10176,Burying the past is much harder than burying remains. I'm... I'm afraid of what you will think of me if I tell you about the things I've done.
10177,I think things are going to be a lot different around here from now on and I have you to thank for it.
10178,We will speak more.
10185,"It may be dead now, but... where did it come from?"
10190,"Keening, and its counterpart, Sunder. Used by the tonal architects of the Dwemer to tap into the Heart of Lorkhan."
10194,I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
10199,"Don't talk to me, you're supposed to be at the ceremony!"
10205,"We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence."
10207,"Once sailing gets in your blood, it don't get out."
10209,These ruins might be interesting if I wasn't already an expert on Nordic history.
10211,"Men who, I might add, we're precious short on."
10224,Ha! You're pathetic!
10225,"If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it."
10228,You've found the Bards College kitchen. Congratulations.
10232,Really? I mean... I still feel like I'm here.
10236,And a hefty cut for yourself too I'm sure. Just see to it the items are secured and the rest disposed of properly this time.
10238,"Oh, hi, I'm glad I ran into you. I was wondering if..."
10239,"Always! Perfection takes dedication, after all!"
10240,"Come on, everyone in town knows that you spend more time with Fastred than fishing in the river."
10243,"Papa may have wanted a son, but he got me. He's a lucky man."
10244,"The Way of the Voice is an ancient, spiritual form of magic in which you project your vital essence into a ""thu'um"" or Shout."
10247,"They're lording it over us all the time, though."
10248,My beacon is sure to attract a worthy soul.
10251,"Gods above, what are you waiting for?"
10253,"Hardly worth giving up Markarth for, but not a bad starting point."
10257,"I'm always happy to see a customer, but I won't deal in stolen goods. That's trouble I don't need."
10266,"I'd appreciate if you don't bother my wife, Tova. She's still in mourning."
10267,"Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night."
10273,"A new face! Such a welcome sight in dreary old Morthal. Welcome friend, welcome!"
10275,Do you know the College of Winterhold? They have a deep interest in such arcana.
10276,"Why, thank you Thonar. I'm flattered."
10278,Fair enough. You can have her. She's the one with the saddle.
10279,"Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return."
10281,"The Guild's at full strength and we have you to thank for it. We've had our share of dark times, and now they seem like a distant memory."
10282,"Now if you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going."
10285,Been a while since I've seen one of those. What you've got there is a Stone of Barenziah.
10290,You've breathed your last!
10292,"And if she decides to leave Ivarstead, what then? No, no... I can't bear the thought."
10294,"You're not really allowed in here, you know."
10295,"A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities."
10296,"As you say, my Jarl."
10298,Did you get that purchase agreement to Markarth yet?
10300,Waiting.
10301,Whatever I can to put my family here back to rest.
10302,Hey! My hangover is gone!
10303,Sssssh! That's not something we want everyone to be hearing.
10304,"All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you. Good luck!"
10305,"Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and speak to Mercer."
10306,How long until they arrive?
10316,"Fancy the leather armor, huh? Something to be said for going light."
10317,What's left of the Honningbrew has been dumped into the sewers. Good riddance.
10321,I am the shadow at your back.
10322,Mara will protect you.
10326,"The Empire would have us become their slaves as they have become slaves to the Thalmor. I will not live as a slave, nor will I die as one."
10328,You should come to Windhelm with me and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.
10329,It's good practice. Most people barely notice what I'm playing.
10330,You are exactly what I was looking for.
10331,"Ah, but there is a slight... problem."
10332,This thing from Saarthal. What does it do? J'zargo cannot say.
10333,"I want to make money just as much as you do, but we don't want to make the Nords angry."
10337,"We may be small, but what we lack in size we make up for in quality."
10338,"So the clues point to the Treasury House, then. That makes sense. Thonar is involved in every facet of the city."
10341,Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.
10346,How would you like a drink?
10347,Shhhhhh...
10349,"Xhuth! Black-Briar or not, say that again and so help me you're going to need more than your mother to protect you from me."
10350,"Father says I don't have the knack for reading, but mama says I won't need it to work the farm."
10351,Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born.
10355,"Come on, you outsiders always have plenty of gold on you. Spare a piece!"
10356,Ayarg garag gar!
10365,Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.
10366,"Our objective is the drawbridge. If we can find a way to drop it, the city will be ours!"
10367,"If you've come to Solitude to join the Legion, speak to Rikke. If not, just keep your nose clean while you're here... or you'll end up like Roggvir."
10372,The dov are children of Akatosh. Thus we are specially... attuned to the flow of Time. Perhaps also uniquely vulnerable.
10376,I don't think this day is ever going to end.
10378,"The Cruel-Seas have been sailors for generations. In truth, I regret not following in the footsteps of my ancestors."
10384,I hope you're enjoying yourself.
10385,Don't mind the yelling. My parents are always going at each other.
10388,How do you put up with that fop Fihada?
10391,Arkay watch over you.
10392,"Thank you again. If I require anything else, I shall be sure and let you know."
10395,You there! What are you doing?
10402,"When Linwe moved into the area, he contacted me and said if I didn't fence for them, he'd kill me."
10404,I used to be. There isn't much time for that in my life anymore I'm afraid.
10413,The graveyard has been lonely. Few pay homage to the dead.
10414,Kaal...Zoor!
10416,The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions.
10417,"You're closing the stall, and that's final."
10419,"Quintus, could you fetch me a copy of The Firmament? I need to compare the old star charts to today's."
10420,"You should see the grin on Horik's face now that we're in charge. I know he hides it, but I can tell."
10423,To Oblivion with you then!
10425,How about an axe? Malacath smiles on the axe-wielder.
10427,Did you think the Blades had been destroyed?
10431,"Now, then, boy. What's the big mystery? What are you doing here, looking like you lost an argument with a cave bear?"
10433,"It was supposed to be an honor, but very well."
10436,There you are!
10440,Toor!
10444,"But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this. "
10451,"Ysmir's beard! The man was always a bit odd, but I wouldn't have expected... "
10453,But I need your help. We need your help.
10459,"You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know."
10460,Praise Talos and all the Divines! Whiterun has been liberated by the true sons of Skyrim!
10461,I will not tolerate this offense against my kin.
10469,I thought we were all dead for sure!
10470,"Years later, Sinderion simply showed up at our doorstep asking to stay for a while... said he was going to do field research."
10472,"If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first."
10473,You're making me angry!
10475,"I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet."
10476,"I'm sorry. So very sorry. The Penitus Oculatus... Maro... He said that by giving you to them, he would leave the Dark Brotherhood alone. Forever."
10477,You're outmatched!
10478,I've got to get out of here.
10480,You afraid to fight me?
10485,So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?
10486,"Oh, hello hello!"
10489,I hope Fastred's doing well in Riften. I miss her.
10491,The thought of the dead rising... makes me sick to my stomach.
10492,"If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!"
10493,Rrrrraaaaa!
10494,I'm glad they didn't find my lucky dagger. It's time to gut these rotten birds. Lead the way!
10496,"I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's doing in there!"
10499,"Off to Bleak Falls Barrow with you. The Jarl is not a patient man. Neither am I, come to think of it."
10500,"Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions."
10503,"Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited."
10510,"Yeah, why?"
10511,"You've seen how we live -- cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name ""Gray Quarter"" is an insult."
10512,Maybe you're right. I guess the battles I won yesterday won't win today's wars.
10515,"Once again, I have found very insulting notes left in my personal effects. Simply barbaric."
10516,"It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects."
10517,Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?
10518,Stormcloaks!
10523,Jarl decided I was too much of a problem. Threw me in here with the Forsworn.
10525,"All your drinks are watered down, Kleppr. You aren't fooling me, and you know Lisbet can't afford to pay me enough for the finest drinks anyhow."
10528,I heard a traveler say that Helgen was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.
10530,This what you want?
10532,We want compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
10536,I think we're almost out. Come on!
10540,We can't march on Solitude. Not yet. One thing at a time.
10541,Of course he does. What sort of a question is that?
10544,"Keep moving, stay focused on your goal, and you will reach the summit."
10545,"My worthless husband is gone, so I run the inn now."
10546,"Great Malacath, we beseech you, aid us in our time of need..."
10547,Slip up and I'll gut you like a fish.
10550,Wait... the Listener is serious? Oh.
10552,"You know, I'm not sure. My husband's been tending to the vines, so I'll have to ask him."
10555,"See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought."
10556,"It's the prophecy, don't you see? Only a Dragonborn can stop Alduin and avert the end of the world!"
10557,"It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel is so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!"
10559,"If you want to try, go right ahead. I don't think anything will get through that thick skull of his, though."
10560,"Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened."
10561,I believe you owe the Guild something.
10562,"Look at these stones. The ancestors knew how to build, no doubt."
10564,"Drink for the thirsty, food for the hungry."
10566,Krosis. No. I know little of what has passed below in the long years I have lived here.
10568,"If you really are Ralof's friend, I'll be glad to help you. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?"
10570,"Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!"
10573,"Have I told you about Valen, my dear?"
10574,I've got a mark who just got an item from a relative outside of Skyrim. They probably should have been quieter about it. You in?
10575,I've been thinking... maybe Camilla needs a little help seeing Sven for what he is.
10576,"You shoe that gelding, boy?"
10577,"You ask if I'm worried? I'm terrified, if you want to truth of it. But I have to stay strong for my wife and children."
10578,Have you managed to make it out to Shor's Stone?
10579, 
10581,Come with me. Our feast is about to begin.
10582,"She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later."
10585,"Search out enemy soldiers in the wilderness, or guarding towns and settlements, and kill them."
10586,"It's just that, well I'm not even really sure it's going to amount to anything just yet. All theoretical right now, you understand."
10588,"Oh, how kind! Thank you."
10590,"A true professional would have kept his cool and dealt with it a different way, but I'll let it go."
10591,"Hey, maybe the reason these gray-skins don't help in the war is because they're Imperial spies!"
10595,We'd better push on. I'm sure the others will find another way out.
10596,You could if I had one. Sold my last available horse to someone that looked an awful lot like you.
10600,"We only trade during the day, outlander. At night, most rest in the longhouse."
10601,"Riches and fortune, within my grasp, and I have to give it all up because they're afraid of a few dead bodies..."
10603,"If you have business, please see Falk Firebeard, my steward."
10604,They found it! They actually found it!
10612,Remind me not to make you angry.
10614,"Hah! A girl running a bar? Don't be ridiculous, Minette!"
10615,Maybe you should look for work instead of begging for coin.
10616,Have you come to gawk at me or is this a social call?
10617,Looks like he's gone for good this time. But I don't think we should stick around to see if he comes back.
10620,What...hey! That felt good.
10628,I'm worried about my daughter. I'm keeping an eye on her for a little while before I pass on.
10630,"I trust the day's found you well, thane."
10634,You. You're coming with me.
10635,"Arngeir. Rek los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rek fen tinvaak Paarthurnax."
10636,"Gerdur? Owns the lumber mill, if I'm not mistaken. Pillar of the community. Not prone to flights of fancy..."
10637,"Forsworn had taken over Markarth, and Ulfric and his men drove them out. Empire promised they'd be free to worship Talos afterwards."
10641,That... wizard is still at the Inn. I can't believe Dagur allows him to stay there.
10643,"Now Sapphire wants her money back, and if I don't pay her, I think she's going to kill me."
10648,"First you murder my sister, then you massacre my men!"
10649,"In the meantime, we'll continue to root them out and put them to the sword. "
10654,Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.
10656,Excellent. I can move more soldiers through the area now that I know those scouts are dead.
10657,I'll pass it along.
10663,"Well, are there any questions before we begin?"
10664,Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.
10680,I'll find some coin for you. I always do.
10681,"She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others."
10684,I told you. I'm done with all that. There's enough blood on these hands. I'm interested in creating things now.
10685,"I need you to eliminate an old woman named Agnis, a servant in Fort Greymoor."
10687,You're lying. You're not quick enough to be a pickpocket. What's the real reason?
10688,This one suggests donning some apparel.
10692,That's right. Dawnstar. My Dawnstar is plagued with nightmares. I haven't slept properly in days.
10694,They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting. They live up on top of the Throat of the World.
10695,We grieve.
10702,"In life I felled foes unnumbered, fearless in battle; but no blade can defend against the terror of this gloom-stricken valley."
10703,Dock work is not good work. Better than Black Marsh though. Much better.
10711,"Wait, oh wait. I know you! Yes, yes. From the road! Cicero never forgets a face."
10714,"Ranmir beg a drink from you, yet? That's gold wasted, friend."
10715,"Of course they do, brother. You keep raising their rent."
10716,"I'm no happier about this than you are, but I don't want the see the Thalmor rounding up people in the streets and throwing them in prison."
10718,Dawnstar has a history of being the site of battles that have crippled the fate of the Empire. I hope this remains true.
10719,"Here's your payment. Well earned, as always."
10722,Does she exact payment when we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one knows.
10725,We better get moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
10728,"What? Of course I know who you are... I didn't mean to suggest, that is, I don't remember even saying that..."
10731,Rikke. Go.
10737,"Oh... well, I'll leave that to you. I trust you know your business."
10738,No one here does.
10739,There you are.
10744,First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.
10750,Move along.
10751,Did you ever want to return to your stronghold? Go back to your family?
10752,Still eager to please. This is good. Skjor may be right about you.
10753,"But my purpose was ultimately gained. My previous champion was erased, and a new one born."
10754,"The safety of the city and our settlements must be our only concern, Igmund. The rest of the Reach is on its own."
10755,Or else what? You don't scare me.
10761,"I'd give you a bow, but it looks like you've already taken it from the rack."
10765,No! You can't be here! You're all dead! I already killed you over and over!
10770,"A gift, Dovahkiin. Yol. Understand Fire as the dov do."
10772,"I'm not certain what business it is of yours, but I'm moth... I mean Jarl Maven's steward."
10773,Colette has already told you. You must be tested before knowledge can be imparted to you.
10776,"Perhaps not as often as he should. In time, I believe he will be more trusting."
10781,Not a day goes by that I don't think about finding a new ship. I guess it's easier just to stay put.
10789,Of course. I would have it no other way.
10791,"Oh, brother..."
10792,"Oh yes, mistress. You're the ""boss."" For now."
10794,Still... everyone assumes the Dark Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual.
10795,"I don't do charity. No gold, no ride."
10796,"Not for us, it isn't."
10802,"Oh, I tell the future, all right. When I feel up to the task, that is. But I'm afraid my energies haven't quite peaked yet today."
10813,You kept saying it would be a huge ceremony at Morvunskar. You said you even had some magic staff there that would handle all the guests.
10820,You don't want to talk to me. I'm just a stand in for a dead Thane.
10823,"Hammerfell? I'm not against the idea, but why?"
10825,Fall to the Thalmor!
10827,True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues.
10828,You can't be serious.
10830,You ever have to farm land while there was a battle going on? I have.
10831,They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide inside? Now go. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
10834,"Some other time, then."
10837,"And you. If you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've wasted your time."
10839,"Of course I am. What do I look like, a tavern wench?"
10840,"Now, on to the business at hand..."
10841,Never knew a place could be so ancient. I bet it's over a thousand years old.
10844,He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves. 
10845,"No visitors. No way. Now piss off, before ya' make me mad."
10849,"A pleasure as always, boss. Here's your payment."
10850,And what about the dogs? How are those precious little angels?
10853,"And the message, sir?"
10855,"And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child. "
10856,I paid extra for the biggest room in the Silver-Blood Inn. I need space to stretch these arms.
10860,"Old Arnleif would be proud of Lisbet. She's kept this place running, thick and thin."
10862,"Both Vittoria and her husband will be there for the duration, and everyone in Solitude is invited to attend. You'll have plenty of opportunity."
10864,"Not yet, no. Although it is true my husband Torygg was the High King, and I am his widow... now is not the time to lay claim to such a title."
10865,"Starting to get too old to work all day, but hopefully Master Hlaalu will let me slow down a bit."
10868,"While technically in charge of the College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied. Thus, I run the day-to-day operations."
10869,You made your decision. Now live with it.
10872,Good. Report back to me when your task is complete.
10876,"What's more, Ulfric's refusal to execute his slain enemy's wife will be portrayed as the ultimate act of compassion. Hmph. It's genius, really."
10881,"In fact, thieves have been known to kill, if there's a profit in it. This war's been hard on all of us."
10882,Really? I'd be happy to show you a bit about herbs if you find the book.
10888,"My men have their orders. But it's a big city, and there's a war on. Plus these murders."
10889,"Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave..."
10892,You don't have enough to earn my loyalty.
10894,"Can it be? You've brought me my amulet? Oh, thank Arkay. And thank you. Oh, dear friend, please, take this gold for your troubles."
10895,"Oh, it's you. Not here to rob me are you?"
10899,Be warned. You have been marked by the Thalmor.
10903,I wish more had the dedication and strength of character that you demonstrate. I'll be sure this gets put to good use.
10904,Perhaps. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
10905,Do you know my father? He's really important. He even talks to the Jarl sometimes.
10906,"Until you get back into the Guild's graces, we have nothing to speak about."
10907,"If I had any customers, I'd be worried about him annoying them. But, well... Look around."
10908,"Hadring got himself another customer, eh?"
10912,My cousin disappeared one night. Some say the Thalmor grabbed him. It wasn't long before I found myself under Ulfric's banner.
10913,Just head north - you can't miss it. It's the capital of Whiterun Hold.
10914,Winterhold would allow us to directly threaten the rebel supply lines out of Windhelm...
10915,"All that remains of the infamous cult, I've gathered in my museum."
10917,"If you two cannot handle this, we can find others to hire."
10918,"You're bloated with disease. The Vigilant of Stendarr can help you, as long as you promise to never assist the Daedra."
10923,The entrance must be past the Forsworn camp. Look for a canyon or cave entrance into the Karthspire.
10924,But... we could use the breathing space to regroup.
10926,"Maven, please. I didn't know it was your man. Had I known, I would have looked the other way, I swear."
10928,Do they? How delightful!
10929,The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
10930,"A heathen. Lovely. Oh, don't put on that angry look. I'm just teasing you."
10931,Well said.
10932,"A note from someone named Calcelmo, in Markarth."
10933,"You might be a guest in Dragonsreach, but you're starting to try my patience."
10934,"Orc poisons are to be feared, if you wish to trade."
10935,"Someone bring me a drink, quick!"
10936,"Cut me down, or you'll never get the claw!"
10937,"The Stormcloaks are gone, but Talos will never be forgotten. I don't care what the Thalmor say!"
10939,I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...
10941,Ha ha! Behold the final trick of the Fool of Hearts! You think me near death? Think again!
10944,"I'm sorry to break it to you, Giraud, but students are an unfortunate necessity of a college. Do try to persevere."
10947,You're making my patrons nervous. Put the weapon away.
10949,"The guardian spirits of Bear, Mammoth and Sabre Cat await you. Return when they are defeated."
10955,We're so grateful for your help.
10956,"Must still be here, somewhere..."
10961,"If he were to be crowned High King, I'm not so certain it would be the golden age his followers expect."
10962,You're as good as dead!
10968,We've got a new order in.
10971,These graves hold the sons and daughters of Falkreath.
10973,I hope so. Skyrim needs people like you to fight for her freedom.
10975,"You are on the right path, and you will prevail."
10978,Tilma will keep the place clean. She always has.
10979,You're finding it. That's bad enough.
10980,"I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic."
10982,I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history.
10983,There's got to be something in that house of theirs. I just know it.
10984,We're making sure your Emperor wasn't lying to his elven masters when he agreed the Empire would give up false gods and foolish beliefs. 
10993,I go where my brother goes. I think he wants to look around some more.
10997,You're going to Fort Dunstad.
10998,Then we have nothing more to say to one another.
11001,Get him! Rip his throat out!
11002,"Whatever happened when you killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it."
11004,Coming right up.
11007,"I work in the mine, just like everyone else."
11008,Thought you might be open to doing it again... for a tidy sum.
11009,Do you have the Eldergleam sap? 
11018,There is a burning city out there that needs a government.
11021,"To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus."
11028,I'd say things couldn't be any better.
11031,Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place?
11037,"The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality."
11039,"I'm sorry, Betrid. I thought I had cleaned the tables properly."
11040,"If this cold numbs my fingers any worse, I'll scarcely be able to hold a weapon."
11043,"It means signing on for the Nord ideas of how to live your life. Honor, battle, glory, all that."
11044,"It does indeed. You know, I hear you had something to do with Sybille Stentor's demise..."
11048,Markarth lives because my family makes sure it's fed on gold and silver.
11050,"The outside world means little to us, and we'd like it to stay that way."
11052,Now you just tell me if you need something.
11053,"And before you ask, no - I don't think it was you. Well, maybe I did, but you saving my sorry hide just now sort of erased any doubts."
11054,I envy you the chance to see this dragon up close!
11055,Let us walk in the steps of the Divines.
11056,"That's the only time when we get food, too. And if there's not enough ore mined up, we don't get any."
11061, 
11069,The road takes us past many cold rivers. We can fill our skins there.
11070,Got another personal score to settle and I'd consider it a favor if you'd take the job. Think you can help me out?
11071,"By Sithis, now I am truly impressed!"
11074,I'm so close to the answer...
11078,"Events in the last several hundred years resulted in a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid."
11079,"Is this about the stables? My husband, Geimund, handles the business."
11080,Leave me alone... I'm in no mood for talking.
11082,Here's the sword. Tell Harrald to stop slaying walls and perhaps his blade will stay in better condition!
11086,"Be careful. I miss my amulet, but a life cannot be replaced as easily."
11087,"Last I'd heard, he was crossing the border from Morrowind into The Rift."
11089,"When Ulfric was killed, justice was done. That might sound harsh, but it's how I feel."
11091,"There's a war on. We need every scrap of ore we can get, so we're going to keep digging. Understand?"
11095,Beyond that are two exterior gates. Find a way to open them and we can take this city!
11101,Hermir's become a decent smith. Like to think I had a hand in that.
11103,"The Mortar and Pestle makes potions, if you can't tell from the name. Just step up to the counter."
11104,"I... I submit. What is your bidding, master."
11107,We will see.
11108,You can't hide from the hidden.
11109,"Ah! You made it! Good to see you, my friend. I'll never forget how you saved my life from those Thalmor maniacs."
11110,Let those that watch from Sovngarde envy us this day!
11114,She's supposed to be on our side?
11116,I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun.
11117,"You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a stake in most anything of importance in Solitude."
11119,"I will see you dead, monster."
11120,But then the dragons returned. And I remembered that the Blades used to be dragonslayers.
11126,"Oh dearest, who cares? So your husband is a lout. The work you do here, with me, is invaluable. The people of Whiterun know your true worth."
11128,A little coin always greases the wheels.
11133,"Well dear, you know where to find me if it ever becomes too much for you."
11141,We got the mill up and running before we found out that the big stand of trees on the hill was sacred.
11142,"Yes, yes. Closer. I won't bite. Promise."
11143,"But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her, is that clear?"
11144,"I used to serve with Trilf and Steirod. Good guys, but don't get on their bad side, you know?"
11145,"I suspect that the power released by the Eye of Magnus was not fully contained, and has coalesced in this part of Skyrim."
11146,But who knows? I've been proven wrong before.
11147,These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.
11150,"Stay outta trouble, or there's gonna be trouble."
11151,"A couple of years? I wasn't a Forsworn when I came, but I joined up when I got in. Easier that way."
11152,Surely even down in Cyrodiil people have heard news of the war in Skyrim?
11154,(Deep breath)
11156,"And with no strings attached. Not bad. Here, got some coin for you."
11157,But we choose our own path now.
11159,"Have you talked to Brelas yet? I'm not a patient man, you know."
11160,Bone-Breaker.
11166,"I've busted heads for Maven Black-Briar when she wants to keep her name out of it. Pays good, so why not?"
11171,"Welcome. If I cannot serve you, I am sure that one of my other traders can do so."
11176,Maven sends her regards Letrush.
11177,"One of my monks, the elf Orchendor, was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bthardamz for me, but has since lost his way."
11178,"If the Tenets were still in place, you would be required to defeat the Wrath of Sithis. Now you just need to pay a fine to Nazir. Ah, the Old Ways..."
11179,"But I have nothing to hide. I'm in from the south, on business."
11180,"Grelod runs this orphanage because she's old, and set in her ways, and doesn't know any other life. These children need love, and comfort. I try..."
11184,"At least we don't have a dragon to worry about, for the moment."
11185,It's nothing. Carry on.
11188,Protect the Jarl with your lives!
11189,"All right, all right. I'll speak to her."
11190,"Yeah, I don't know how I feel about what goes on down there."
11191,My time at the Bards College was brief. A prodigy has little need for formal education.
11194,"The others... I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex... perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child..."
11197,"And now you'll walk away, if you know what's good for you. "
11199,"On behalf of the sons and daughters of Skyrim, on behalf of all that is righteous and true, take this token of our appreciation for your service."
11200,Oh my. Probably something about the men. We all wish we had her problems.
11202,I know. I just don't want you to leave; you're the only good thing that's happened to this city in a long time.
11204,"Light, medium, or heavy?"
11207,"And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos."
11208,That's right. Who's invisible? Me! 
11212,Is there... something else you need?
11213,I just think they've let my sister's death skew their outlook on Ulfric and what he really brings to the table with this war.
11214,"A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn."
11216,Don't bother me if you haven't found anything about the mask.
11219,This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.
11220,I bet Naris gets a kick out it. Nasty fella he is.
11222,I could have left it behind. I could have put it back where it came from.
11224,Really? That seems hard to believe. You're sure about that?
11225,My mother and father died years ago. Falion takes care of me now.
11228,"Yes. So now you don't have to go, do you?"
11230,"While we were off fighting the Elves in the Great War, Madanach was busy ruling over the Reach."
11231,"There's a... A problem, yes."
11232,"Hey, Orc. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
11234,"But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back."
11238,"I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that?"
11242,"They carried out a genocide of dragons when they first came to Tamriel, and now they will do it again, with your help."
11243,These fights are invite only. And you're not invited. Slag off.
11245,Disappointing.
11247,"I don't know who you think I am, and I don't care. Leave me alone!"
11248,"It's the most secure prison in Skyrim. Throw scum in, close the gates. No one gets out."
11250,They're hiding over by those stables!
11251,I found this. I thought you might like it.
11253,Dangerous-looking elves who didn't give their names. Draw your own conclusions.
11255,"Stay back, lord!"
11256,"Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all."
11260,"I know you and father Rorlund have many duties to attend to in the temple, but sometimes I feel that there are more important matters to attend to."
11266,"They were mighty, in their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...  sahrot hunne. The Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater."
11269,I still do. I just like to have food waiting for me when I come home.
11273,Is that so? I was right about you.
11274,"I guess we have our entire lives together, now. Where should we live? You could stay with me...."
11277,"Near Giants' Gap, in the gloom before dawn, we marched, unsuspecting into the Imperials' trap."
11281,My father died. Things won't be the same without him.
11283,"Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid."
11285,"Remember always this: As you will it, so it shall be."
11287,What? How... where did you get these?
11288,I'm proud of you for helping provide for us.
11289,Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.
11291,"The Empire might try an take the city back, or worse, we'll get a visit from a dragon. We've got to be ready for both."
11292,I wish I could head to one of the capital cities... maybe even back to Mournhold. Anywhere but here.
11300,Come on. Hurry. We might be too late.
11302,Sure you can handle that? Ha! Of course you can.
11304,Where's Elvali? She was right behind me.
11306,"There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again."
11307,"You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information."
11311,"No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I must get back to my duties."
11312,The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before jarls and moots.
11314,"I'll fight you again, but not until you have the gold to back up your bet."
11315,"I'm busy right now, lass. We can talk later."
11318,Praise Talos!
11323,So many things lost....
11326,The time for talk has passed. We must hurry.
11327,Time to show what you're really made of.
11329,"She had a book with her, ""Song of the Alchemists,"" that I used to read over and over. I miss having a copy."
11331,I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
11334,"Yes, I thought we'd gotten past that bit already."
11335,"Yes, my Jarl."
11338,I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire story.
11343,You haven't been able to take it back yet. Why should we give it up now?
11351,"As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade."
11356,My steward has such a home available to you for purchase. I think you'll find the accommodations to be most pleasing.
11362,Here we go.
11363,Hands off.
11364,"My family owns this inn, but I've put Kleppr in charge. Right rat for the right job, I say."
11366,"You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having?"
11367,"We've got strong swords and sturdy armor, if you're looking to buy."
11369,"You should unload some of that unwanted gear. Head over to Sadri's Used Wares, talk to the Elf."
11372,You cut these bindings this minute! You hear me? You cut these bindings right now! 
11373,I've been holding on to this for you. I hope you like it.
11378,"Stop, outlander. You must pay for your crimes in blood or gold."
11381,"Until next time, guardian."
11388,Finally.
11390,Karliah destroyed everything this Guild stood for. She murdered my predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild.
11392,...never enough gold... just need one good haul...
11393,Dwemer ruins. The people under the mountains. All gone now.
11396,I suppose thanks are in order.
11397,Woah!
11399,"They wanted a confession. To what didn't matter, they simply wanted me to admit to something."
11400,"Let them do the work, that's what you pay them for!"
11401,"Your typical Solitude wench is like the city itself. Stormy exterior, but ah the charms that lie within..."
11402,Indeed. You don't get to the position my mother's achieved by blind luck... her business sense and diplomatic skills are legendary.
11403,"Ulfric once tried to get me to fight for him, but marching bores me."
11406,"Don't you sweet talk me, Alvor. Not after last night. I'll bring you water when I'm done with my other chores."
11408,I have many important things on my mind. Your concerns are not among them.
11410,You tell J'zargo when you are ready.
11415,You going to be at the inn tonight?
11416,The what?
11418,"Is something wrong. ""Is something wrong?"" he asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!"
11420,Clearly you have no idea who I am you or you wouldn't dare approach me.
11424,That's a true Nord hero. A legend. So great that the Divines themselves lifted his soul into the heavens and made him a god.
11425,It's quite fetching actually. The craftsmanship is excellent.
11429,"So... carrying that weapon around like that makes you feel safe, does it?"
11431,Can I get you a drink?
11432,And I was so close to being rid of you.
11434,"Now that this is a Black-Briar Meadery, you can be sure that we'll be selling only the best mead in Skyrim."
11441,You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.
11442,You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less...
11443,"Here, the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War."
11446,"His name is Torsten Cruel-Sea. He's really rich, 'cause he owns a farm called Hollyfrost."
11449,There are many valuable artifacts all through the temple.
11450,"Nothing. I'm busy, and I don't like being bothered unless I'm expecting something from you."
11451,"Yes sir, I have."
11452,What? You stupid or something?
11454,Can you just imagine how ancient this place must be? Hundreds of years? Thousands?
11457,"Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's Captain of the Guard and we're going to poison the mead."
11460,"Few will admit it, but we know the truth about the Great Collapse."
11462,"It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!"
11465,"Oh, excuse me. With my uncle gone, things are a bit of a mess."
11468,What is it? Do you have one of the Razor fragments?
11471,Bad move.
11473,"Yes, suffer for you."
11475,"The Mortar and Pestle has cures for every illness, from Ataxia to Witbane."
11477,"Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you believe that sort of thing."
11479,"Yes, I know. That last job was my fault. I obviously thought Niruin was ready, but I was wrong."
11481,I've got some fresh cabbage. I'm thinking of making some apple cabbage stew.
11485,I bet you'll be glad to get to Whiterun and get out of this weather.
11487,Just a servant of Skald the Elder. Not worthy of time or consideration.
11495,"Good day, Lemkil. I saw some nice dresses for your little girls while I was in Whiterun. I'd be happy to purchase them, if you like."
11498,Now that guy was nuts.
11499,Exactly. Together we stand more of a chance of making this work.
11502,I haven't lived this long to be beaten by you!
11505,Of course. Skyrim has always been part of the Empire.
11509,You again. What are you doing here?
11514,Get him!
11516,"One day, I intend to be chief. I will fight my father and my brother for it, as is tradition."
11517,"Very funny. My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person."
11518,"I see. Well, should you change your mind, the contract will be available for a while."
11519,You're sweet. I'm just not ready for that sort of thing right now. I'm sorry.
11520,"It does not surprise me. They do not share in what I see, and I cannot explain it to them."
11522,"Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!"
11523,"Consider it just more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you need to clear them out."
11526,"I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?"
11527,"Oh, right, they said you were captured crossing the border."
11528,I'll see you dead and buried!
11529,There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean that you are ready to understand it.
11533,You did? Maybe that's why I'm so sleepy now.
11534,"Take care, and go with the blessings of the Nine."
11535,I know I heard something.
11536,And don't always just do what you're told. Nobody rules anybody in the Companions.
11537,I hope you're not planning on picking my pocket.
11538,A smart man came and told us about a blade piece. 
11539,"Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milady?"
11540,"Ah, yes, your pay. The Company thanks you for your services. Should we ever be able to help you, stop by."
11547,I might have to stop and get myself a pint of Black-Briar mead while I'm in Riften. Almost worth the trip all by itself.
11550,"I am an Orc and a warrior, but I have no desire to become chief."
11556,Hmph. Fine.
11558,My husband Thonar handles all our family's business. He's an important man.
11559,Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.
11560,Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy.
11566,"Drunk again, Embry? Don't let Alvor hear you talking to me that way. He'll stick your head in his forge."
11568,I had hoped your scholars would be on a level comparable with my own colleagues. They are not.
11569,Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and piece of mind... and some lessons with the blade.
11581,"Why would I agree to let a dragon into the heart of my city, after working so hard to keep them out?"
11583,Look. Nordic ruins. I hope there's gold inside.
11584,"And, as you told me once, the next world will have to take care of itself. Ful nii los. Even I cannot see past Time's ending."
11587,"If you're here to report any instances of corruption, be confident that we're handling these rumors accordingly."
11590,Thanks!
11593,"By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all."
11595,What matters is their heart.
11596,"Once I have the sigil stone, I shall inscribe the spells that you seek."
11598,Better in here than out there.
11599,"The Shadowscales are all but forgotten. An ancient tradition, from another time."
11600,He's dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into Dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared.
11603,"I've heard stanger things, are eaten over at the Temple of the Divines."
11605,Burn it! Burn the vampire!
11611,"I've been cracking rock ever since I was able to hold a pickaxe and I'm telling you, this mine is drying up."
11616,Long live the Empire.
11622,Better honey?
11624,My duty is to keep the Jarl safe. Not play nursemaid to you sycophants.
11627,"I've picked up a few tricks by reading the tomes scattered all over the shop, but I don't have the knack to pull half of the formulas off."
11631,Got keen eyes? Might see nasty old Hajvarr up on White River Watch. Piece of work. Jarl should just run him out and have done with it.
11632,"Rumor has it you couldn't follow the Guild's rules, so we can't do any business until it's been worked out."
11637,Yeah?
11638,Avulstein... you stupid boy...
11642,"If you're heading to Kynesgrove, stick to the road. Some pretty dangerous caves between here and there."
11645,Legend says that my forefather Lenne discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead.
11649,"If you're going after the claw, you'll need to know the way."
11657,"Please forgive my earlier rudeness. I am so often interrupted by visitors wandering in, I can occasionally become quite savage."
11659,We weep.
11661,"You would? Oh, that would be wonderful."
11662,"If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous too travel."
11664,"Just follow the road north. When you get to Honningbrew Meadery, turn left and the road will take you to the city gates."
11665,"Between the cliff and Snapleg Cave there, I hate this stretch of road. There's an evil air up here. Getalong, horse."
11668,"Father says I'm too young to train with a sword, so I practice with my fists!"
11669,You're not welcome here. Go.
11672,When do I get to go hunting?
11678,We need to bring it down!
11679,I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father.
11683,I couldn't. It would dishonor the place the chief has made for me.
11691,No. Not like this.
11699,"Of course you are! I prayed, and you came, and now you'll accept my contract!"
11703,I've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire.
11704,"Whose side are you on, Reburrus? I'm not worried about Skyrim, I'm worried about the Reach. Specifically, the part of the Reach we're standing on."
11705,"She wants the city this badly, she can fight me for it."
11706,"Profits continue to rise. The warehouse continues to bring in good revenues, and rent on your stores in the Well is acceptable."
11708,"My sister keeps telling me that the farm keeps us alive, but I don't really call this living."
11709,Nords' armor has lots of fur. This sometimes makes M'aiq nervous.
11710,We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.
11716,"He's tough, loyal to his men and a good leader, but if you're not a Nord, Ulfric will never trust you."
11718,"Please, make haste. The Emperor's ship won't stayed moored forever. We won't get a chance like this again."
11723,"I don't know what we're doing here, but orders are orders."
11725,First we'll kick the Thalmor and their bloody Imperial puppets out of the country. Then we'll rebuild Skyrim into the land she once was.
11727,"Even if it means her leaving Ivarstead, I want Fastred to be happy."
11732,"The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open."
11734,"If you've got the raw materials, you can use the forge to make something new."
11736,Nice to meet the person who went to King Olaf's Tomb.
11743,Come to me with questions. I know our history almost as well as Vignar by now. Except I can remember it.
11744,"Stonehills' warmth is a welcome change in this cold, bleak land."
11749,"Are you blind, or just stupid? You think the tribe has not seen you talking to me? You think they would not know?"
11750,"Do you realize when the orcs attacked, I was only concerned with myself? I fled... and left my brothers and sisters behind to die."
11755,"Next, I need dirt on the Jarl's Steward. Heard there's blackmail potential there."
11757,"Ha! The most important question of all, that one."
11761,"My papa says I'm greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him! He says it means ""smart,"" but my brother says he's wrong."
11766,"Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth."
11767,"The old man trusted you, so I'll trust you. "
11774,This is it! Gathrik awaits us!
11777,Infiltrating an occupied fort and making it out in one piece is nothing to joke about. Well done.
11778,Curse my good-for-nothing daughters! My wife was twice the woman they'll ever grow to be. She gave her life birthing them. What a waste.
11779,Some like taking friends on adventures. M'aiq thinks being alone is better. Less arguing about splitting treasure.
11780,This is it men! It's time to make this city ours!
11781,Winterhold itself died in the years between then and now. What's left out there is a husk. Only the College really remains.
11784,"Come on, what are trying to do? Insult me?"
11786,"Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in."
11787,Sinding. Came through as a laborer. Seemed like a decent man.
11794,"Besides, you're not scared of a few sleeping metal men. Are you, Drennen?"
11802,"You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you...   "
11806,"Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better."
11808,"Fastred, I have something to say to you."
11809,"Why do you pester me with battles we can't win? I need my steward to plan for our victory, not nag me with every ill account."
11810,Leifnarr said they'd pay double what you can usually get at the markets.
11813,A bunch of lazy rabble trying to make a living. Can't get better workers in because everyone's afraid of the tomb up above the mine.
11816,"If not for Talos, and a few modest bribes paid to the right jailors, why, I would not be standing before you today, resplendent in my faith!"
11819,The Flame Atronach is a vital companion for anyone relying on Conjuration. Summoning one here would certainly show your skill.
11821,"I'll have a magical tether to your soul while you're inside. Once you're done, it'll be as simple as pulling you back into your body."
11822,There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.
11823,He is gone.
11825,"By tradition, a mother always teaches her children how to smith. If a chief has a second wife, she is called the ""Forge-wife"" in honor of this."
11828,You did the job and you did it clean; that's all we ever ask. Enjoy the gold.
11829,Get him!
11831,Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.
11832,Your time runs short.
11842,The Emissary? What's this about?
11849,"You hope to gain in council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it?"
11851,"Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen."
11855,"Our actual position and policies are irrelevant. No matter the facts of the response, it will certainly be twisted to suit the whims of either group."
11858,"I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Brother."
11862,"It's just that papa promised I could make something at the forge. So maybe we could do something together, hmmm... next week? Is... that okay?"
11864,"I have done no such thing, nor do I intend to. I simply wish to live my life in peace."
11865,"Here you go, dear."
11866,"Come on, move it. We have Nords to kill."
11877,"I'm a Thane. In the future, you may want to gain that information before talking with someone. Risk of looking like an idiot, and all that."
11878,"The Thieves Guild used to run this city. Now they're nothing but braggarts and bullies, rotting to death down in their Ratway..."
11879,"Are you sure that's the real reason? It wouldn't have anything to do with others making an Argonian unwelcome, because if it is..."
11880, 
11881,My daughter Adara is going to be a fine silversmith when she's older.
11883,You can pretend not to hear me all you want... but you better stay out of the Black-Briars' business.
11884,"By the way, I don't know who you are, but unless you want me to blow your cover, I'd advise that you avoid me for the rest of the party."
11888,"""When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles"""
11890,From ship's captain to lowly crewman... I suppose I deserve it after wasting all my coin on gambling and women.
11892,Just what you see here.
11893,"With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately."
11894,"I've a little of everything for sale, come and see for yourself!"
11895,"From her citadel at the center, she reaches forth to collect our memories, leaving nothing in return apart from visions of horror and despair."
11896,Did Viola send you to bother me?
11897,"You've done it now, whelp. You broke the rules and now you're knee deep in it."
11898,You... you were talking to that murderous savage. And then he escaped. What are you hiding?
11903,"I'm sorry, the Temple of Dibella is closed. You can receive your blessing, if you wish, but the other sisters are in seclusion."
11905,"Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still..."
11906,I should make sure Svari is okay.
11907,"Well, I'd better get some sleep. Don't mind me, though. You two make yourselves at home."
11908,"The Emperor of Skyrim. Dead. These are dark times, my friend. Dark times, indeed..."
11909,Yatul and I do all the hunting. Mul and Gadba do all the mining. It seems like all you do is find more wives to get killed.
11911,"We have a chance to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, forever. It's all up to you."
11913,Not now. I'm too upset to talk.
11915,We hardly ever get new customers anymore.
11917,Just stay out of my way.
11920,"Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?"
11922,"Look, you've already been told you're not allowed here. Turn around and go back the way you came."
11924,"Grelka, do you fancy a walk tomorrow?"
11925,"Do colors seem brighter to you? Everything seems bigger, too. Strange..."
11926,You only face failure once more...
11927,"Remember, I'll give you the best deals, or die trying."
11928,Indeed. One should find his death while he can still call himself a proper man.
11930,"I said, next prisoner!"
11932,Welcome. There are many things here that cannot be found elsewhere.
11936,"Fine, but there's a whole crypt of draugr underneath the mine."
11939,"Until then, I've no ale for you."
11940,"My brother, Thorald. He was fighting for the Stormcloaks, and went missing. Everyone assumes he's dead."
11943,"Not today, we can't."
11946,"Your question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering."
11947,Could that be... the Voice?
11949,Here. Give Camilla this letter. It's full of venomous nonsense. Tell her it's from Faendal.
11955,"I've been enjoying this journey with you. Not for the wealth we've accumulated, but just being carry Mara's will to every corner of Skyrim."
11956,"And how may Ma'randru-jo assist you, hmm?"
11958,The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for hearings?
11962,Strun!
11964,"If you fancy a bit of music, let me know."
11966,He might find something good in there. One man's trash is another's treasure.
11967,Good to hear. You can be a difficult woman to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
11969,"Got someone I want you to hurt. Don't worry, I can pay."
11972,A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!
11977,"I'm on it, lass."
11978,"No, Karita. I don't think I could."
11982,You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.
11987,"Well, it just so happens I have the perfect mission for you."
11988,"Hmm. Well now. Yes, this might actually be something interesting. You'd better show that to Tolfdir right away."
11991,"Well, yes. Probably."
11992,Aggghh! Re...lease me!
11993,"A good many dark elves were driven from the city, and people became... uncomfortable with the presence of the College."
11994,"Well, he's quite obviously mad. Whether or not that makes him dangerous is another question entirely."
11995,I believe you'll find the guards to be a bit more cordial with you in the future.
11996,"Lass, I know what you've been up to."
11999,We destroyed those Stormcloak traitors!
12001,"Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?"
12004,"With Irileth, you either come back covered with glory or not at all."
12006,"I'm grateful for your efforts. Here, take this."
12008,"Then I say well met, friend. I could tell you were a sharp one the moment I laid eyes on you."
12010,The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War.
12014,May you carry the warmth of Mara to all corners of the frozen wastes.
12016,The Throne of Ysgramor! The throne of my father...  I only hope I can prove worthy of the honor.
12019,Not anymore. Thanks to you. Friend.
12020,I'm sorry. I don't know anymore. I'm just visiting here from Cyrodiil.
12024,"If I were you, I'd pack up and get out of here before you end up in one of those burial cairns."
12025,"Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven, if you have the strength."
12026,"You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about it."
12030,To what do I owe the honor?
12031,I'll just prepare the subject now...
12032,Traitor!
12034,"Here, take him this letter. I may not be as eloquent as he is, but I hope he understands."
12040,We must be near the entrance for that bear to make its den here.
12042,"He didn't say, but you'd better move fast."
12043,They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises!
12046,Die!
12047,"I like being stronger when I become the wolf. But Kodlak says it is bad for the soul, and I trust him."
12048,We grieve.
12053,"I thought she'd have realized it's hopeless by now. I tried to tell her, years ago..."
12057,What exactly are we talking about here?
12058,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
12059,"I've got what I came for, I better get back to Dragon Bridge."
12067,I hadn't asked you because I was afraid you'd say no. I appreciate your help.
12068,You may think this war is nearly won. You're wrong. I've been fighting you with a mere handful of troops.
12070,It's good to hear you say that. I wish my wife was as simple as you.
12076,That's Whiterun up on the hill there. We'll be at the main gate before you know it.
12080,"A masterstroke by General Tullius! He's only been in charge here for a few months, but he's turned things around for the Empire."
12085,Don't make me bring your father into this.
12087,What? No. Get away from me.
12089,Then you'll see some real magic.
12093,"So, when he was made Jarl again, he didn't wait a moment to name me his Steward. He said I was the only choice."
12099,The presence of the living is near...
12102,Kill the damn dragon! Unless you have a better idea?!
12109,Why you insolent little bastard...
12113,Only trouble is gathering materials has become hazardous. The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with bandits... and worse.
12114,"Maybe we could invite some of those nice guards over. You know, for some supper?"
12119,Pull up a seat and have a drink.
12122,"What was it like killing your first one, huh?"
12124,"She sold the city out to the Aldmeri Dominion. Were it not for her betrayal, Taneth could have held its ground in the war."
12125,"But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim, for our right to fight our own battles..."
12129,"I'm not proud, but I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor."
12137,The tapestries hung here and outside were found in hideouts where members of the Mythic Dawn would meet and plot.
12138,All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks.
12143,There is no greater madness than those who seek to become vampires. That's a dark bargain if there ever was one.
12144,"The ways of the mystic are known to me. I have remedies and cures, should you need them."
12146,"Oh, no. No, that won't do at all."
12148,I would be honored. Beyond honored to have such a thing here at the College.
12151,He proposed that the real reason Saarthal was fought over by the Elves and the Nords was because something was unearthed there.
12155,Look at those old stones. Ancient Nords sure could build.
12156,That was a good bit of work.
12157,If you were willing to wear one of Radiant Raiment's outfits and speak to the Jarl I would not only pay you but let you keep the outfit.
12158,Correct.
12159,"I've got all sorts of interesting things for you to buy, and I assure you they're of the finest quality."
12164,"Oh! Well if you change your mind, come back and see me."
12165,"Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble."
12166,"Out of my way, outsider."
12167,"Ah, my parlor. No finer place to boil eyes, no..."
12168,"So far, so good."
12169,A true Nord never fears death. It's the how and why of it that one needs consider.
12171,No one cares about us! No one! We could die and no one would ever even know! They'd just throw our corpses in the canal!
12172,"I don't care if you wrote it yourself -- if you want a book from here, you go through me."
12174,He is our creator and master. The Daedric Lord of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
12177,I die for my people.
12179,This group... this family... this band... this is the best thing I've ever been a part of.
12188,"Just like Talos himself at the Battle of Old Hroldan, reclaiming the Reach from those heathen natives."
12189,"Well, it's all over now. Lieutenant said you could see the smoke from Whiterun."
12190,How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe. 
12191,"Please, I know I'm asking you to do something difficult, maybe even dangerous. I just don't know who else I can trust."
12192,I thought it was painfully obvious that Gulum-Ei was important to the Guild.
12193,"Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys."
12194,"Have you heard the tale of Mathieu Bellamont, and the great treachery of Cheydinhal? Kill a boy's mother, and vengeance festers in the son... "
12195,"""Long has the Stormcrown languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon."""
12196,I'll have your head for a trophy!
12197,"If you're sympathetic to the Empire, you'll be wise to put Falkreath far behind you."
12198,To the east of here is a hidden grove where the Eldergleam resides. It's the oldest living thing in Skyrim. Maybe all of Tamriel.
12200,"Fine, I'll show you, you big bully."
12203,Blessings of Arkay be upon you.
12206,Make sure to recommend us to your associates.
12209,"Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?"
12211,You tell this sorry bunch of thieves that they need to put down their flagons and get to work if they want to keep their status!
12213,How long will it be sung? My feet were set upon the rock but it turned to mud and drew me down.
12214,It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura. Only black souls would be able to enter it once we finished.
12215,"All right, all right. Just bring it to me tomorrow and I'll fix it for you."
12217,Ugh. I'll need to bathe thoroughly to get this stench off of me. 
12219,"She's got friends in high places, and I don't just mean in Skyrim."
12220,"M'aiq knows much, and tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not. "
12223,Please... don't break my wares!
12224,"Bye now, miss."
12225,J'zargo has seen that Tolfdir likes you.
12229,"Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's rambling?"
12234,This isn't a command. Just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've got to get back to my work.
12236,It's just... 
12238,"Can't fault anyone for that! As long as you hate the Empire as much as I do, that I can work with."
12243,"There's a tranquility in magic, don't you think? It is simply energy, to be harnessed by those with the will and knowledge to do so."
12244,Something smells foul.
12245,Talos be with you!
12247,"Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history."
12248,I've scraped this collection together by whatever means I could.
12254,"Are you all right, dear? I thought I saw a tear in your eye a moment ago."
12257,We bring honor to the Companions.
12258,"Ah, yes... seems he sent back my satchel stuffed with letters. I look forward  to reading them."
12259,Sometimes I think your head is made of rocks.
12265,Now you'll pay!
12270,"Killing him secretly will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses, so be it."
12275, 
12276,"Every night, I walk around the Gray Quarter and let them gray-skins know what I think of 'em."
12281,Hello friend.
12282,The inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
12284,"And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power. There's a whole world just waiting for me!"
12286,"Well, you did something Vex couldn't do at Goldenglow, so you're looking pretty damn good."
12290,We used to think the pirates had an army of battlemages at their side.
12293,"Ahkari freed me from a prison in Cyrodiil, and now I must repay my debt to him."
12301,"Auxiliary, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open."
12305,Did you forget the Oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?
12312,They burned his body before I could raise him... it should have been returned to me...
12314,I can almost hear its heart.
12315,Hurt him. I mean her. Whichever. No killing though. And I ain't paying your fine if you get caught.
12317,Someone do something!
12318,I'm sorry. We're only interested in helping our patrons.
12320,"Well met, Brand-Shei. I've come by to browse your wares today."
12323,Let me stew. Alone.
12324,(whine)
12325,"This land's tough and unforgiving, but beautiful, too."
12330,"You there, hold! If you are a true friend to Skyrim, you will help me in my mission."
12332,"The blessings of the mine have been many, but I have no mate to share them."
12335,You won't get away with that!
12337,Aaaiiee!
12340,"I raised my Sven to be strong, and proud. A true Nord."
12342,"Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures."
12343,"""Dragonborn"" huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?"
12348,Do I know you? I didn't think so.
12350,Hmm hmm.
12355,"I don't know if you're capable, and I don't have time to find out. If Kodlak will vouch for you, I might have some work you could do."
12356,This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other? 
12357,"Well, no."
12359,"I was there. I fought in the Great War. I was on the field at Anvil. And when I was struck down, they left me."
12360,"Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure."
12363,"Maybe you can do something for me, first? Duach has a bottle of Skooma. Finest distilled Moon Sugar. I'm shaking just thinking about it."
12364,My sister and I once traveled the world to assemble our collection. Such adventures we had!
12366,"For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do."
12367,You aren't going to pass. You're going to give me everything you have. Whether you leave here in one piece is up to you.
12371,Eternal slumber awaits...
12374,"Mara's domain encompasses the emotions we strive the most to embrace; love, compassion and understanding. "
12375,I can only give you my word as a priest of Mara that my intentions are honorable.
12379,"As you can see, I have much that requires my attention. If you're inclined to gab, there are some nice prison guards you may like to meet..."
12380,Smithing's been in my blood for generations. I owe my success to my forefathers and their recipe for flame.
12385,Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear? 
12387,"Pavo and Gat are the only survivors. I'll be sending word to the Jarl about this, but I don't know when help will come."
12390,You're on! Loser buys the next round!
12393,Take heed! They've awakened!
12394,Whew. That was close.
12396,Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old bonewalkers.
12397,"They are counted upon every bit as much as Candlelight, or Invisibility."
12400,"Aela said you were hers, and I wasn't supposed to interfere. She scares me."
12401,"Good. The more time he pines for the dead wives, the less time he spends finding a new one."
12406,"Sorry, I don't have a single septim left after paying the town guard to keep quiet about the mark you killed."
12408,"Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there."
12413,"Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost."
12420,A citizen of Winterhold has asked for our help.
12421,What an amazing day this has been. I hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm... I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness... for me.
12424,I'm sure you two will get along famously.
12430,"If it's horses you want, you're talking to the right person."
12431,What news? Why isn't Fjola with you?
12433,Wish the Jarl's wizard would up and leave with ya.
12434,"Thank you. Here, this is for you."
12436,"I can always count on you, can't I?"
12450,"I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge."
12452,You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward.
12465,"You need anything, anything at all... don't hesitate to ask."
12471,Why don't you go... sell something.
12475,"I cannot leave Idgrod's side, so I must stay here. Could you see that it reaches Captain Aldis in Solitude?"
12476,"Oh, and to be with you!"
12478,"That they had arrived, asked for information which was provided to them, and went on their way with no suggestion of further interaction."
12480,What's on your mind?
12484,"Then I suggest you ""collect"" it. Until you pay the fine, you are effectively cut off from all Dark Brotherhood duties and contracts."
12487,I'm gonna wear that tail as a belt!
12495,We're ready when you are.
12498,Time's wasting and Mercer's still out there. Let's get this show on the road.
12500,I don't have to take that from you!
12504,Esbern's your man for that kind of thing. He may be able to at least point you in the right direction.
12508,"What? Who is this, Brother? Another of the smooth skins looking for food? But this one wasn't trapped with us..."
12513,I don't much like this truce. Feels like a betrayal to me.
12515,"In any event, our anonymous chef shares a passion for food with all of Tamriel. And that anonymity will prove the Emperor's undoing."
12518,You're a good friend. Here. Take this. You'll like it.
12523,"Your kind deed will not go unrewarded, my friend. Tell Erik I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor."
12532,"You, you there! Help me, I'm trapped."
12534,"In fact, there is. I need a soul gem filled, if you're up to it."
12541,They've got a mage hiding in that window up there!
12542,I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun.
12544,Zok morokei! More souls to feed my master's hunger.
12545,I'm with the Vigil of Stendarr. We believe this house might have been used for Daedra worship. Evil rites and so forth.
12547,"You'll have to make do with what we have, Proventus."
12549,A few septims for my supper is all I ask.
12553,I'll explain on the way.
12559,Have what? What in blazes are you talking about?
12561,"But Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising has divided us. Now seems we can scarce look at each other without comin' to blows. Petty and foolish, that."
12562,"Obsessed with it, really. Nobody paid much attention back then. I guess he wasn't as crazy as we all thought."
12564,What do you think you're doing? Knock it off with the flames already.
12567,"Oh yes, quite fine. My accommodations here continue to be just what I need."
12568,"My, my. What do we have here?"
12570,"Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you."
12577,We're safe here now. But what of Morthal?
12580,"He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out."
12583,Can't say I'm surprised with the way things have been going around here.
12589,"Very good. And you'll be returning to... Well, if you don't mind me asking, where exactly will you be going now, sir?"
12590,Thanks.
12595,Hyargh!
12599,Why didn't you tell me? What did he say?
12600,"Look, if you just want to sit around the Flagon all day getting drunk, that's your business. Just quit wasting my time."
12604,"Sure, no problem. We'll find someone else to do it."
12606,"Silence, traitor! Move. Slowly."
12609,I count my blessings every day.
12610,"No, I'm afraid I don't know anything of the sort."
12614,"Now, now, our duty is to record the great tales of history, not to pick sides in them. Best to stay out of the warfare, I feel."
12618,"Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lad?"
12620,"Iron sword, huh? What are you killing, butterflies?"
12624,Less coin in everyone's pocket means less coin in mine.
12625,I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with.
12626,I say you've earned an early pardon. Let's go.
12627,"Alvor? The smith, isn't he? Reliable, solid fellow. Not prone to flights of fancy..."
12628,How much?
12630,"Don't mock it, pup. Even the lowliest beasts can kill the weak and arrogant. We'll try more powerful enemies next, if you survive this."
12631,"And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary."
12636,"Some fear our new resident wizard. As they grow to know him, they will accept him."
12637,If that is your wish.
12646,"Look, that Vici woman had a bodyguard. I know it's terrible she got murdered at her own wedding, but the city guard is hardly to blame..."
12651,"Remember, nothing but genuine fire salts will do... the forge knows the difference."
12652,"The sooner this war ends, the sooner we can all get on with our lives."
12655,Those rebels better not try coming to Haafingar.
12658,No time to talk. Snitch or double-cross me and I'll kill you. I mean it!
12660,It seems warmer down here than it was outside.
12662,She's been with me ever since her parents were killed by bandits and she was dropped in my lap.
12670,"Hail, friend! It's good to see another merry soul enjoying this fine day."
12671,You? A servant of the King of Corruption? Has the beast's standards fallen so far? Tell me another one.
12673,"When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots of children, just like you."
12675,"I want a drink, not company. Now go."
12677,Being an apprentice is great. I get to swing a hammer at things.
12682,"Now, you'd better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation."
12683,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
12685,"Getting the shakes, huh? All right. Take it. Old gods keep you."
12689,"The ancient Nords were a savage people, but they built some remarkable crypts and temples."
12696,"Alduin's wings, they did darken the sky. His roar fury's fire, and his scales sharpened scythes."
12698,I hope Fjotra is happy in the temple. We're so honored to have given her.
12701,"Honestly, I can't keep up. But by all means, don't stop now."
12704,Nothing... Nothing...
12705,Why are we doing this again?
12708,"You're an idiot, Kleppr. Why did I ever marry you?"
12710,I've got a feeling about this one.
12713,Let me know if you find out anything about the fire.
12720,"...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the ""Gourmet""..."
12722,I've done what I needed to do keep mother happy. It doesn't matter what I really believe.
12723,"Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple..."
12725,Don't be sorry for me. I just - if I would have known it would come to this. Mother...
12730,"I can afford to buy meat now. I prefer working in the mines, anyway."
12732,That girl's determination won me over. I suppose it didn't hurt that she said she only wanted to learn from the best smith in Skyrim.
12733,"Humph. Used to be everyone in Markarth wore a necklace showing his home province, from Elsweyr to High Rock to Hammerfell and Cyrodiil..."
12734,Not to mention the rebels completely control Windhelm and all of Eastmarch hold.
12737,"Once you get to the tower, head north. Bleak Falls Barrow should be just around the corner further up."
12741,"Please, get that to Avulstein right away."
12742,"I ended up selling that ship to open this place. Seemed only fitting to name it after her. Well, changed it a bit I suppose."
12744,"Now, if I'm not mistaken. Legate Rikke has a special assignment for you."
12745,Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
12747,"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
12748,Oh! Are you going to teach me how to turn into a mud crab?
12750,That sound could bring mountains down!
12754,"All right, you want to go?"
12756,"We were forced to arrest all of them. Ulfric Stormcloak, their leader, used the whole thing as proof that the Empire had abandoned Skyrim."
12758,"However, as promised, I'll still be more than happy to take any stolen merchandise off your hands."
12762,"Hey, no fair! Get her, Stump!"
12763,"What're you lookin' at? I'm not afraid of you, ya know. Even if you are my elder."
12764,"Tell me, Ragnar, what do you think of the Orcs?"
12765,"Quicksilver Mine is the best mine in Dawnstar, and you can tell those Iron-Breaker miners I said so."
12767,"I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!"
12768,"Delphine? How do you ... ? This is just a trick to get me to open the door, eh? I told you to go away!"
12770,How about some armor?
12771,"Don't worry, I'll get Esbern there in one piece. We'll wait for you near Karthspire. Good luck."
12772,"We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals."
12773,Don't expect the local Nords to take kindly to you once they find out you're from the College.
12774,"Ni faas, Dovahkiin!"
12775,"Good, and take this little message back to your bosses."
12776,You know how children are. Her fancies change with the moon.
12778,It's like the ancient legends. Dragonborn...
12780,Can you help me? He's in the tomb doing Gods know what with my dead relatives.
12782,"Break the law in Markarth, and it's off to Cidhna Mine with you."
12787,"No, just check in the guests and manage the coin and keep a roof over your head. No, nothing important."
12788,"So, what do you think, my dear? Could a beautiful woman like you ever see yourself with an old codger like me?"
12792,I must focus now. This ritual is very important.
12798,"You ever met one of them cats? - kah-jeet, I think they call themselves. I hear there's whole countries full of them down south."
12802,"Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I might hurt. "
12803,Once you leave the party you can't just come back.
12804,Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.
12805,I'd rather see the Sea of Ghosts swallow Winterhold entirely than have it run by the Empire.
12806,"Damn fool parading around with your weapon out. You planning on hurting someone, huh?"
12807,Good people of Solitude.
12808,"Ah. Indeed, indeed. I do remember."
12809,Ooohh.... how decadent. I never would have guessed it.
12810,"Well, I guess you'll have to."
12811,May Talos shield you from all harm.
12818,I'll never submit!
12819,"Okay, okay, I'll tell you."
12820,Aerin tells me you might be dealing arms to the Thieves Guild. Is this true?
12823,"Now, you go about your business."
12824,My family has served Skald Felgeif's family for generations.
12826,"Secondly, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. I want to gain a fortified position here before we launch our final attack on the capital."
12827,One day I will shape a weapon fit for a chief. Maybe that chief will be me.
12830,"The blade can be as lethal as the spell, but deadlier still is the one who wields both!"
12831,"Somethin' just ain't right about that Sybille. You know, I've never seen her eat a thing? That can't be natural."
12836,May your time in Falkreath be pleasant.
12838,"All right, I'll go kill this giant."
12839,"All right. Got a simple one. Just get in, change the books and be back in time for last call. So how's about it?"
12840,This was worth coming back for.
12842,It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.
12843,"Mirabelle Ervine... Or Tolfdir. They're qualified to discuss him. Not me, definitely not."
12846,"Igmund is alive, and I'll keep it that way, Jarl or not."
12849,...might pay off my bounty this time... walk into the city a free man...
12852,Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and look for Mallus Maccius. He'll fill you in on all the details.
12854,You think living with Grogmar is easy? Did you see how he lives?
12856,You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.
12858,"Can't wait until we raise anchor. Anytime the boat's not moving, I start to get impatient."
12860,"Someday, I'll be a gallant heroine. You make it look so.. appealing."
12865,I don't think anyone here truly understands how useful my work will be.
12868,It has been long since I held tinvaak with a stranger. I gave in to the temptation to prolong our speech.
12871,"I will do my best to lead the tribe, but I don't know why Malacath chose me."
12873,Not him again.
12874,Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.
12879,Noo...
12881,Fine.
12883,"Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should come by our shop. Radiant Raiment."
12884,Perhaps you could spare a tomato for a priest of the Divines?
12896,"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my brother around. It's comforting."
12897,"For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout."
12898,"Out of the way, meat."
12902,No! Don't hurt me again!
12903,"You're all heart, Kodrir. I bet Lady Mara is weeping a special tear for you right now."
12919,This is where you'll be staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate of others.
12921,Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.
12922,Yes. It is.
12925,"I just can't be a part of this place any more! The things we do here - evil, evil things. No more!"
12927,"Typical. Well don't mind me, then."
12929,That's just insulting. Not even a proper bribe?
12930,"Old Embershard Mine's up there. Used to produce a lot of iron, but collapsed and taken over by criminals, I hear."
12931,I did. Those mead stains are always tricky.
12933,"I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of hands."
12938,"You'll know, You'll know the Dragonborn's come."
12939,There's a fourth piece. That scabbard in the display case. Built to house the Razor. And there's more.
12940,"Snilf, I told you begging isn't the answer. I expect to see you at the temple later."
12947,You're not getting that treasure.
12949,"Look, um... Thanks. And I'm sorry for my unneighborly reaction. If you talk to Cicero, you be sure and tell him I'll be down to help soon."
12952,"Mining's my life now, I wouldn't want to do anything else."
12956,"Oh, fine. Have my boon and be done with it. I've got more interesting deals to make, anyway."
12962,"Here, use my sword to do it. I made sure to sharpen it for the occasion."
12965,I'll make the preparations immediately!
12967,You have a problem with that?
12968,"This is lovely, as always, Eola."
12969,"Ah, you're from the College? I've been waiting for you."
12973,Looks like we're the only ones who made it.
12976,I came to Skyrim looking for a better life. So what did I get? Another war. 
12983,"We all get used, dear. It's living with it that makes you a woman."
12988,"The Imperials were weak. They created this Forsworn problem, but now that we're in charge we'll solve it."
12990,"Taking an easy job, eh? Well, go and do some damage. Just stick to the shadows and keep out of sight. Want to go for it?"
12992,You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.
12994,Maybe you're right. I guess I just didn't want anyone to think I couldn't handle one Nord lass.
12995,Be careful... we're certain to find more of the awakened within.
12997,"Name's Ennis. If you've got friends who do business in Whiterun, they might know me."
12999,"Go on, Hadvar. Let's hear the rest of it."
13002,I'm not paying you or Brynjolf a single coin! Now get out of my tavern!
13006,Hasn't been seen for a while. She just vanished without a trace.
13007,"How goes the hunting, sister?"
13008,It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.
13012,You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal.
13017,"So you as good as admit you're working for the Imperials. Yet you walk in here, and ask to join me. What are you playing at?"
13024,Now you're being ridiculous. This is our city. Not theirs.
13025,"How could you, Erandur..."
13028,You look troubled. Have you come seeking guidance?
13039,"Come now, where's your sense of propriety? Extorting an old man like this."
13040,Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what happened to him.
13042,Got word from Torsten Cruel-Sea in Windhelm that a rival Guild is tryin' to get itself started.
13043,"I'm sorry, I don't. Come see me again later."
13053,"Maybe we'll pay you a visit tonight, little spy. We got ways of finding out what you really are."
13054,"Well, you know the drill. You don't see it here, it's gonna cost you extra for me to get it."
13056,"Some day, brother. Some day."
13058,"When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters behind to die."
13067,Welcome. Let me know if you want anything... think I got a clean mug around here somewhere.
13072,"Well... there is guy like that. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you."
13074,"Oh, it's you."
13077,"I know your sights are set beyond this town, but for now, while you're under our roof, I need you to pitch in a little more."
13081,"Ulfric is a fool and a coward, who naively believes he can bring about peace through warfare. It's rather sad, really."
13082,"Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even keep the Stormcloaks in line. No way I trust them with the Emperor's life."
13084,"Waste of talent throwing me in here, right?"
13086,I've already provided you a key to the museum. You should consider it an honor. Few are allowed to browse my collection.
13093,"Then Ulfric Stormcloak came with his militia. That must have been a sight to see, him shouting folks to death."
13095,"Oh, no it hasn't. Let's be honest."
13097,"Ah, kill it. Kill it!"
13098,You're telling me. Playing nursemaid to a bunch of bees and drinking mead all day beats dying on some battlefield.
13106,You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.
13107,And it won't end here. I'd die before I went back.
13112,"Aia, this is a delicate matter. Why don't you review your lessons and be silent for a while."
13114,"You don't want to talk about it, or you don't know?"
13115,"All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge. Good luck!"
13116,"I'll take control of the family on my own time, Betrid. Until then, my brother remains in charge and you'll keep your mouth shut."
13117,That's it. One more time.
13118,"I'd sell her for that, but you ain't got it."
13120,Narri! This mead tastes like water and the meat has gone off.
13121,Indeed. The temple here in the city is my charge.
13123,"Traitors, civil wars, dragons. Bah. Those troubles don't cross my doorway. So sit, relax."
13127,"Come on, at least try to hurt me."
13131,"Help out an old man here with some coin, would you?"
13132,"Bring up some more mead, my boy. This cask's nearly tapped!"
13136,"I mean, yes. Certainly it is, but that doesn't matter now, because I know you're hoarding something even more important at your College."
13137,Come back when you have the coin.
13141,"Typically, love in Skyrim is as earnest as the people who live here. Life is hard, and short, so there is little room for long courtship."
13144,"Thalmor in the Ratway? What's next, Spriggans in the Bee and Barb?"
13146,Give it your best shot!
13149,"What are you doing here? You need to get that Staff, or else we don't stand a chance!"
13151,"Hey, you. Stop right there!"
13152,"Greetings, honored friend. Could I interest you in some fine jewelry?"
13156,I'm still not sure I understand what you're asking.
13157,"Okay, I think this door should lead to the main burial chamber where Vals is holed up. Let's get in there and put and end to this."
13161,"Thank you. He's not a bad man, just bad with his coins and his drink. My husband Dagur could tell you stories, there."
13163,"Mmm, sorry. I really can't risk it. I'm sure you can find someone else with a little less dignity."
13166,Suit yourself.
13172,"Now we're just fellow fugitives from the Thalmor. I didn't know she was still alive, but I'm not surprised. She was a survivor."
13174,'Course not. Dogs I could train. But a half-starved wolf? Not a chance.
13183,"But now Kematu's gone, and the rest of his snakes should slither back to their desert."
13185,How are the new breeds getting along with my dogs?
13190,You must have a death wish.
13191,Don't you... Don't you say that name to me.
13196,Those bastards.
13204,"Thank you. Umm, blessings upon you too."
13205,"You did the best you could, Dragonborn. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point."
13208,"You need a sword? Uh, how about a small sword? Nail-sized?"
13211,"Imperial forces will withdraw from The Pale, and Jarl Skald the Elder will be allowed to return to Dawnstar."
13212,"That completely takes care of all your basic problems, magicka burn, dimensional collapse and thermic drift!"
13213,Azura. Mother of Roses. Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Your chosen champion has returned your Star to you.
13215,"And to think, Mirabelle questioned my allowing you into the College. I can just imagine the look on her face now."
13216,"Who's this, then?"
13219,You can't defeat me!
13220,I'll be handling the horses with Cedran gone. Miss that old man.
13222,"Beggars roam the streets, crime runs rampant and the threat of war is driving away business."
13223,Prison's not so bad. Less complaints when I kill people.
13227,"Ah, but we can discuss that later, yeah? What does the Brotherhood need?"
13231,"Since he's apparently occupied, and I will need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin researching the subject."
13232,Give up while you still can!
13233,"Skald supports Ulfric's rebellion, and he doesn't like having a couple of old Legionnaires living in his town."
13234,"Um... okay. Well, the boots aren't here yet. Hopefully on the next Khajiit caravan."
13235,Aaaaaahhhhaaaaa!
13236,And I will make you the instrument of my cleansing light.
13237,"But I refuse to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance."
13241,You puny weakling!
13242,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
13243,"It's you and me, prisoner. Stay close!"
13245,I thank you all again for making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.
13252,At least something good came out of that trip to Saarthal. I didn't find anything but dust.
13255,I work in the forge and the mines. Mother says it pleases her and our people.
13260,"Hello, tidbit."
13262,What next?
13263,She did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
13266,Now was it two parts giant lichen or three? Hm...
13268,All right. I have everything you asked for all ready to go.
13271,Fjotra!
13273,We were an assassins guild that was sanctioned by the Empire to provide public as well as private executions.
13280,Just give up! You can't win!
13281,"You can see it from here, though. The mountain just over the buildings."
13283,You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left her?
13287,"But if you spare me, I can be a powerful ally to you. And I would promise to never return to civilized life."
13289,I hope you'll stay for a bit. We could certainly use the business.
13291,Rip the eyes from his head!
13292, 
13293,"I'm not stealing anything. Besides, some jail time isn't going to make me roll over and play dead."
13294,"After running from Nightcaller Temple, I wandered Skyrim for years until I was taken in by a priest of Mara who lived in Morthal."
13295,"Good, now maybe I can get back to work."
13298,"Mostly it is the Nords. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities."
13299,Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe he found what he was looking for in there.
13300,And you thought I was just a pretty face.
13301,"There's the stories about Helgen, bandits, skirmishes between the Stormcloaks and the Imperials... it almost seems endless."
13308,(Crying)
13309,"Well, well. You've slain my followers. I should destroy you for your impudence!"
13311,"New to Narzulbur? If you're smart, you'll keep moving. There is a wicked shadow over this place."
13316,"Here is the Book of Fate, discovered in a secret room in the Arcane University."
13317,"This won't be easy, but that's why I'm sending you. Think you can handle it?"
13319,Perhaps you begin to see the world as a dovah.
13320,Help! In here!
13322,Don't let it get me. Help!
13324,I'm Burguk's forge-wife. I shape all the steel for the stronghold.
13327,I'll keep that in mind.
13330,"The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads."
13332,"Thank you. Please, do not open it. It is... private."
13333,That your best? Huh?
13336,Reyda! You saw Reyda? Did you tell her Narfi cries? Did you tell her Narfi never said goodbye like mother and father?
13339,I'm diverting Gar and Haddring's men to join him.
13340,See what a warrior of true mettle is like.
13341,Good hunting. 
13343,Oh dear. I wish there was something we could do to help him.
13348,You have not answered my question. Why do you need to learn this Thu'um?
13349,We've got arms and armor of all kinds.
13350,Thank you for your trust. I am eager to return to my homeland.
13351,I could listen to him play all day.
13355,Damnit! Why can't Ulfric see he's tearing Skyrim to pieces?
13360,"I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed there, we should be able to locate a sample."
13364,"That's the real question, isn't it? No one can deny Elisif has a legitimate claim to become High Queen of Skyrim..."
13365,"If my ma could see me now, she'd scold me good. She'd tell me I should know better than to go poking around in abandoned forts."
13366,"Thank you. Now, since he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines."
13369,But... I... very well.
13372,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
13374,"Gods guide you, Hadvar."
13377,"All my auguring never predicted this. A woman for Mauhulakh, eh? We'll see how this goes."
13378,"Atub is wise beyond her years. I take her advice seriously, and you should as well."
13379,"You look like someone who knows how to wield a weapon. Well, you've come to the right place."
13380,"If that means breaking into their strongboxes and stealing something valuable from them, then so be it."
13381,"This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy."
13382,So the Stormcloaks took the Reach? Maybe Talos really is on their side.
13384,I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help.
13385,No way. I'm quick!
13389,I owe it all to my father who started me swinging the pickaxe when I was a barefoot little girl.
13395,Burn the King!
13399,Did you bring anything? The pain...
13401,Yeeaaaggh!
13402,"All right, keep your voice down... you want everyone to hear you? I'll let you in, just let me unlock the gate."
13403,What about your family? There must have been someone waiting for you back at the farm. Wondering if you were ever coming home?
13405,"Thank you, land-strider."
13406,Viarmo is too concerned with precision. What of instinct? Hmm? What of passion?
13407,Where are you going? Come back!
13412,And there is... no... Listener!
13414,Oooh. Time to kill?
13420,We'll need to set up water brigades to combat the flames.
13421,"Good, just remember the order: do job first, get drunk second. Now take this and go."
13424,Make sure the back fence is repaired. I swear I saw some skeevers in nibbling the leaves yesterday. 
13425,"Too bad, looks like I need to find someone else to take care of business."
13428,Now you let me know if you need a cure... or anything else.
13429,"But I've seen first hand what Ulfric is capable of, given the chance. Suffice it to say, he is no friend to Markarth, and no friend of mine."
13430,Fascinating! Original Akaviri bas-reliefs... almost entirely intact!
13431,That's Solitude just ahead. Only a few more minutes now.
13432,Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could throw at us.
13433,You don't impress me. So don't even try.
13434,"Without training, you have already taken the first steps towards projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a Shout."
13435,You can buy me whatever you want!
13436,"If you don't watch out, you might even earn Vex's respect. Now that'd be something, eh?"
13437,"Drafted into a war, how could my life get worse?"
13439,"Please, please... hold all your questions until after I've finished!"
13443,"You wish to be married? It's good to see love blossoming, even during these difficult times."
13445,Didn't take much to prove myself and knock them into shape. Now every free blade from here to Windhelm wants to sign on for a piece.
13448,It was lost years ago in a Dwemer ruin.
13449,"Hmmm, Olaf did become king and Numinex escaped later. It's entirely possible... and I'm sure the court will like that, I'm writing it in."
13453,Good. I'll have a sack of coin waiting for you when you get back.
13454,"Wo lost fron wah ney dov, ahrk fin reyliik do jul, voth aan suleyk wah ronit faal krein!"
13461,Well? What is the meaning of this?
13469,He'll never find me here.
13472,It shall be so.
13482,"I need to get back to Markarth. Here, take this. It's the least I can do for saving my life."
13483,(bark)
13485,"First, there are ancient references to dragon ""heartscales"". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need."
13489,"You're threatening me? Oh, that's rich!"
13490,Let me try again...
13493,Sorry if my father seems a bit distracted. A lot's happened.
13498,Good on you.
13504,"I can appreciate that this... thing, this Orb... It's very impressive. Very unique, and definitely worth studying."
13511,"Everything's under control, then? Right. Keep up the good work."
13512,You are a disgrace to the Altmer. I should kill you on general principle.
13514,They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.
13518,"Welcome, brother! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature."
13521,The Empire. They absconded with them. Or so they think. The ones they saw. The ones they thought they saw.
13523,"You're looking for something, yes? The... Staff of Magnus."
13524,Really. We aren't interested in seeing all that. Remove yourself until you are properly attired!
13525,I suppose I should return to my papers...
13526,I can. It might save your life.
13532,"You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me anyone I can rely on."
13533,Do you ever find that you regret making this journey?
13534,"I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Daedra to retrieve one for us."
13536,You think you're finished? I've got plenty more where that came from.
13542,"It's from that treaty that ended the Great War, remember, when the Emperor was forced by the Thalmor to outlaw Talos worship."
13549,Now this is going to be a good feast.
13564,"Alright. This here's enough to keep your insides from spilling out, except from the fiercest of blows, and shouldn't weigh you down too much."
13566,Good job. Please accept this in return.
13567,"Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint."
13572,Half the field? What could need half the field?
13573,Ah ha! So you're a student of theoretical applied harmonics!
13574,"So when they did find out, it was either we arrest Ulfric and the militia, or enter into yet another war with the Aldmeri Dominion."
13575,The mine will be running better than ever thanks to you.
13577,Don't be shy. You should be the one to carve.
13578,I'm running low on Lesser Soul Gems.
13583,"I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold."
13584,"Look, you must have me confused with someone else."
13587,You're a strapping young man. Don't be a stranger.
13590,Nyyarrggh!
13592,"Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard."
13593,"Once Kodlak began looking for his cure, I'd wager Skjor didn't bring it up again."
13594,Careful! I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
13595,Hm. I had not thought of it that way.
13596,Keep at it. We need to work twice as hard now that fat-headed Leigelf has declared war!
13600,"So long ""friend."" Ha ha ha!"
13601,Hmph. Everyone seems so insignificant now.
13602,An Amulet of Mara? You're not married? Surprising.
13605,I just don't understand what kind of a man does that.
13609,"Hmm... we've heard whispers of an enchanted pair of gauntlets, hidden and protected by dangerous men, beasts, or worse."
13610,"Oh, it doesn't matter now. Gavros is never coming back, and he was supposed to have the crystal. Without that, we're lost."
13612,I don't care... We're going all the way in. I want to know what Shalidor hid in here.
13615,Isn't it amazing?
13621,Safe travels to you.
13622,The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.
13623,"Yes sir, fine sir."
13625,"So whenever we came across more than one deer in a single location, it was imperative we kill as many as we could."
13627,"Bring all four to me, and I shall use them to inscribe the spells for you."
13629,"These energies, on occasion, become... polluted. Effort must be made to see that they are kept pure, clean."
13634,If it isn't the best brawler in Skyrim. Good to see you again!
13637,What do you hope to find? Sweets and my dolly? Or maybe some of my spare Nightshade?
13642,What have you got for me today? Nothing illegal I hope!
13646,"Ah, Yngvar, here to sing? You know an employee of the Silver-Blood family is always a guest of honor here."
13647,We'll stay here and see if we can find anything else that could be of use.
13649,"If you think you can steal my throne by winning the hearts of the people, that's where you're wrong. Keep that in mind."
13650,"It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love."
13655,We never should have brought that thing here...
13660,What do you make of it... the dragon? What does it mean?
13663,Only the most famous warrior band in all of Skyrim. Have you been living with the horkers?
13665,"Oh, thank the gods. Here, take this with my thanks."
13666,"Everything's for sale, my friend! You need visit no other shops today!"
13669,"I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear friends, and... in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered..."
13670,"The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... I some ways I still don't."
13672,"There may be a way out, down this way."
13676,"It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all."
13681,Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have been volumes written on the subject.
13682,What? And you call yourself a son of Skyrim?
13684,"I told you, I know everything about this castle."
13686,"Our hadrimme, our minds cannot even... comprehend its concepts."
13687,"Reyda would gather ingredients from the small island in the river east of here. Then one day, she just vanished."
13692,There are others who would gladly accept my favor. 
13695,It seems I will never take my rightful place as High Queen.
13696,Trust like that is not freely given.
13697,I'm certain you're aware of the loss I sustained a fortnight ago.
13699,"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as mortal, but as dovah!"
13701,You want to talk? Finish those jobs for Brynjolf first.
13704,"You mean the Dragon Bridge issue? I'll be honest with you, I was planning to let that go. Varnius is a bit jumpy at the best of times."
13708,"Don't know. Creepy fella, black robe. Couldn't see his face. Paid me a pretty sum to get that into your hands, though."
13711,Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath.
13713,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Haafingar. Congratulations."
13717,"Without it, I cannot finish my work. All these years, so much time, so much energy..."
13719,"Well then, I think  a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right?"
13720,We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it?
13726,How could you possibly know about...
13728, 
13731,Nothing there. Strange.
13733,Filth. Run to the horizon before I hunt you down.
13734,It's all on account of this blasted ring.
13736,Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.
13737,This situation with the sewers beneath the city. I hear people have entered this place and have gone missing. Do you know of this?
13739,"Oh yes. You're a fine fat one, aren't you!"
13741,Now this is real guard duty. Just throw them in the mine and be done with it.
13744,I ain't done nothin'.
13747,"If you stand before me to accuse me of sacrificing children, or eating the hearts of the dead, you may save your breath."
13748,"So polite! So nice! Cicero likes you. The Night Mother is sure to like you too. Oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends."
13750,I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor.
13752,"We made a pact that one day, we might reunite... but I believe that day is long in coming."
13754,"You lay one finger on Igmund, and I'll end you Stormcloak."
13758,"What's going on, Madanach? You wouldn't have old Grisvar killed unless you weren't planning on needing him."
13759,"Bear fat in the hearth fire, if you believe Hroggar."
13761,(Whistling)
13764,The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.
13765,Give me a reason to try.
13766,Vun!
13767,"Anuriel, would you please stop declaring that the city is safe for the Jarl to roam? You and I both know that isn't true."
13768,You must help us appease Malacath.
13769,"You mean Roggvir. Yes. I made an appeal to Captain Aldis. He allowed Roggvir to have a proper Nord burial, as is the custom in Solitude."
13771,"Sigh. Yes, as usual. I'll be there."
13773,"You speak to Burguk, chief of Dushnikh Yal."
13778,Aggghh!
13784,"If you want to get paid, keep your weapon sheathed."
13795,"When the smoke cleared, the White-Gold Concordat was signed... it was supposedly a treaty aimed at establishing peace within the Empire."
13796,Looks like you had no trouble.
13797,You hear anything?
13798,"We're looking for information about a woman -- a foreigner in these lands. She's a Redguard, like us."
13804,A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore.
13805,"By the Divines, the Forsworn are here in the city!"
13814,Enough with the training. I want to go fight something.
13817,Wait just one moment...
13820,You speak in riddles sometimes.
13823,"I know, I know. My head's in the clouds again. Just... forget I said anything."
13824,Quiet down.
13825,"I'm sorry about Roggvir. It's a shame, I liked him."
13828,"Take your books and go, before I change my mind."
13831,The air has the smell of beasts. The hunt is good today.
13833,"So that's it, then. ""Don't come back."""
13836,"You should not be here, outsider."
13839,"I pay a good wage for any iron ore you dig up, if you're looking for work."
13842,Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale! Straight from the fields and orchards of Whiterun to your table!
13843,"Aye, that I do. I ain't sayin' he was perfect, but he knew what it meant to be a Nord."
13846,I'm a sailor on the Northwind. We're laying over in Windhelm for awhile.
13849,So you're off to find some staff now? I don't see the point of that.
13851,You've shown yourself useful so far. All these lunks are too afraid of Haldyn to head in before the fog's cleared.
13855,"Alms. I said ""alms"" you backbiter. Give a crippled worker a helping hand."
13859,Plenty of chores to do...
13863,"I fear for you and your husband, should the Thamlor come here. But perhaps there's a way I can help. "
13864,"No, I suppose we haven't. Brelyna Maryon, of House Telvanni. First of my family to leave Morrowind in a long time."
13865,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
13866,"But unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to handle?"
13867,Fish? Again?
13868,"As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place."
13871,I don't want that coming back to haunt me.
13872,The way this war is going you'll soon have plenty of veterans like me to buy drinks.
13874,I don't think that could have gone any better.
13877,"Oh, I thought you were already on your way to Bleak Falls Barrow..."
13885,My father is more generous than he lets on. Gives me plenty of spending money.
13886,Come see me in the market if you're looking for the finest custom jewelry in all of Skyrim.
13887,"Now, by law and tradition, I can only grant the title to one who is known throughout Eastmarch, and who owns property in Windhelm."
13888,I'm not sure what just happened but I assure you I will get to the bottom of it.
13891,"That s'wit. One day, he'll regret pushing all of us around."
13892,"The dark elves and Argonians won't soon forget Ulfric's prejudice, but I'm doing what I can to repair that rift."
13894,"Yes. Were I to simply lay down and die, it would not please Malacath."
13897,Naggh!
13898,"I just wanted to take this time to thank you all for being here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with myself, and my new husband."
13901,"We should be inside, loading up on treasure. Worry-scales here thinks we should wait, though. Don't get any ideas, either. We were here first."
13904,"Okay. All right. Wonderful. You're welcome! I'll just be on my way, then..."
13905,The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of honey I need to make my mead.
13906,Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperial milk drinkers what true Nords look like!
13913,"The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world."
13915,Same thing we do with all the other natives who want to change things around here.
13918,Haven't you got some chores to do?
13922,"It's all about sizing up your mark, lad."
13924,"Well, that's just about the best news I've heard all week."
13927,Please give me a chance to try again.
13928,"Anyone suggesting that Restoration is better left to the priests of the Temples, I think, is forgetting a few things."
13931,"Sky Haven Temple. An ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach. That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall."
13935,My claws are sharp. My will to kill... unquenchable.
13936,"Jarl Black-Briar. I must admit, I do like the sound of that."
13939,"It's filthy in there! Dirt everywhere, and it looks like the dogs have the run of the place."
13940,There's news of rebellion against the Empire. Strange noises have been heard in the marshes at night.
13942,What is it?
13943,"Don't make me the fool and let me down, all right?"
13945,Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.
13947,I'm so glad Vittoria and Asgeir chose a public reception. That way the entire city can share in their holy bond.
13948,A parent should never outlive a child. Having my son's spirit here... it's as if he never died.
13950,"Sorry, I thought Skald the Elder sent you. We've got an order to fill, and he's not known for patience."
13953,"Good to see you, lass! How are things?"
13956,"Kharag, take a break and drink with me! Those trees aren't going anywhere!"
13958,Enough of this! Fight me!
13961,Glory to Nocturnal!
13963,Most of my kin are in the longhouse. Come back during the day if you wish to trade.
13966,They have catapults.
13969,Thanks for the help. Not many willing to take on the Forsworn these days.
13970,"Where am I? You! Out with it, then."
13971,On your knees!
13972,We've stopped. What is it?
13978,It's these nightmares. Me and every one of my workers can't catch a nod without having one.
13984,"To receive the touch of Mara, you must first act as her hands in the world."
13985,All hail the savior of the Dark Brotherhood! All Hail the Listener!
13987,Would you raise your shield in his defense?
13990,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
13993,Hard not to.
13996,"Mind yourself with that fire. Don't burn anything down, now."
13999,"Dark times, indeed. I fear the worst for Morthal and my people."
14000,"Whether you know it or not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues."
14004,"I don't know. If you see any big strong men around, let us know, will you?"
14012,My pa always warned me about these things!
14023,"Oh, if you're worried about me trying to meddle with you..."
14024,She's buried outside of town. That's where I'd look.
14029,We carry just about anything you could need...
14031,I'm here to ensure that General Tullius does not exceed his authority.
14033,"Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you thus."
14034,But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might think.
14035,It won't be a waste.
14038,"Where? I would never... ah, I see. You are a fellow enchanter."
14041,Humble Cicero lives to serve.
14043,"If you can get Braith to leave me alone, I'll be your best friend... forever! I'll pay you, too! My whole life's savings - two septims!"
14044,"So the Blades have survived yet another disaster of their own making, and continue to meddle in things they do not understand."
14046,That was three days. I'm thinking more like three weeks.
14047,(bark)
14054,"It's about your singing. Well, not your singing, your songs. But you know what I'm talking about."
14057,In these parts? Good luck. But don't come this way again.
14058,"At first they called us that to belittle our cause. But we gladly accept being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, the only true High King of Skyrim."
14059,You're not from around here. I'll bet you're here to help with the war!
14062,"Come on, hurry up."
14065,No... But I belong to her.
14066,"You dropped this. Good thing I found it and not someone else, otherwise you might have lost it for good."
14069,An intruder in the Sepulcher!
14073,"I know all there is to know about the drinking of it, and that suits me just fine."
14077,"Sometimes, when she goes to her room to work or sleep, I slip out for a bit. Noontime, every day - that's when I hit the streets."
14078,Gettin' to old for this.
14085,You looking for work? We could use an extra hand in the mine. Just bring me any Corundum you dig up.
14086,"What is it you seek, my child?"
14088,"Patience, Dorthe. You'll get some time at the forge, I promise you. But not right now. You need to keep watching me. That's how you'll learn."
14090,"Help yourself, by all means. Who cares if I starve?"
14091,As our voices summon you the blood of the innocent binds you Wolf Queen! 
14096,"Aye, to your husband. Divines bless his memory."
14097,"My mother taught me the millwork trade... you know, which trees to cut and which ones to pass up."
14098,"Lost my helmet in one of the old caves. My pretty, pretty helmet. Life just got worse after that. Kept losing things. So many things...."
14099,"Hmm? Oh, no. No, not really. I... Actually, I've forgotten what I was looking for."
14100,"Now, leave me. I don't want to arouse suspicion by talking to someone that clearly doesn't belong here."
14104,I surrender! I surrender!
14105,They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable.
14108,Looks like we're on our own now.
14109,"Oh, such colors!"
14111,"I don't know, Babette. Looks like he may have suffered a head wound. Best not let him out of our sight..."
14115,Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.
14125,"Aerin, you never cease to amaze me. You always see the good in everything."
14128,I've heard some rumors... about you and Skjor.
14129,I expected better from you.
14136,"Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years."
14137,Who left that here?
14144,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
14146,"The smoke woke me up. It was hot and I was scared, so I hid."
14150,"Yes, kind morsel. Let us go up, and mind Melka on the way."
14152,"I'm going to keep preparing the body, if you'll excuse me."
14161,Some say Alduin is Akatosh. Some say M'aiq is a Liar. Don't you believe either of those things.
14164,"...and if I spy a singing bird, I'll snap its neck before it's heard..."
14165,"Avulstein, put that down! She's here to help us find Thorald!"
14167,"Right. The leader of our fight against the Empire. I forget that most people don't know what he looks like, except for those Imperial wanted posters."
14170,Just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
14172,"Hello, my love. Back from some adventure I bet."
14174,Tolfdir as Master Wizard. Certainly didn't anticipate that.
14179,Be careful on the way to Solitude. Damn Stormcloaks could be anywhere.
14188,"If a pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said that they would become one with the shadows. What that means is anyone's guess."
14191,Is he... sifting through trash?
14192,Who are you to say what I should do? I'll pay her back when I'm ready.
14193,We're running out of bread. I hope the supplies get here soon.
14195,"No, no, no. I've got more blood than you know!"
14196,Your call.
14199,I feel... unbeatable.
14202,"We want Imperial forces to withdraw from Winterhold, and allow Jarl Kraldar to return from exile."
14206,"Aye, that I do. I've got to, if I hope to be as good as Eorlund Gray-Mane some day. In fact, I just finished my best piece of work."
14207,"Following me, huh? You're not very good at this are you?"
14208,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in the Rift.
14211,"Very well. I'll give you a chance. But if you can't do it, I will."
14212,Good. Wait. Dead? That's not what I asked for. I... uh... you should leave. I need a drink...
14213,You seem uncomfortable being here.
14217,"In Falkreath if I don't know it, it's not worth knowing."
14219,"Well... I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly. Be careful, and come right back!"
14220,"Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you."
14222,Shut up.
14224,Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!
14230,"Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either."
14235,I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
14236,Of course. Take what you need.
14241,Stop! That's priceless!
14245,Almost ever since he became leader of the tribe.
14246,"I'm the Jarl's personal blacksmith, but that doesn't mean I can't sell you a few pieces for a fair price."
14248,"It only takes but a moment to say a silent prayer to Mara. Please come by soon; not for me, but for yourself."
14249,Vampire! Burn it!
14251,"Either pour another drink or keep moving, Ambarys."
14252,My Thu'um is strong!
14253,"Next time you wish to accuse someone of a crime, I suggest you obtain proof!"
14255,It's too bad the Burning of King Olaf was called off this year. I think some of the younger bards would really have gotten a kick out of it.
14256,What the...?!
14258,I'm...I'm invisible!
14262,"I prefer finery. Like this. Here, for your trouble. And I suppose I should show you a little about Illusion magic for free, shouldn't I?"
14264,Every prisoner in the Reach is just another worker for our family.
14265,Can you? You have the power of the Voice? Now I'm interested.
14267,"I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about."
14268,Rest a spell! Can't work every minute of your life.
14276,"I'm not looking for special treatment, Aval. All I did was talk to Ulfric."
14277,The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...
14280,"Take it. Take the coat, have your fun. I'll see you at the festival."
14281,I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me.
14282,Be on the lookout. The Butcher could be around any corner!
14283,We can't do that. Every soldier we send to hunt dragons is one more man that can't defend the Reach.
14284,There is one... Yngvar. He's quite popular with the ladies.
14288,I'll be sure to tell her.
14289,Good. I was hoping you hadn't forgotten about it.
14291,"You've got no sense of humor, you know that? Why don't you pick up where you left off with ""The Real Barenziah."""
14292,"Please, I can't... Just... just go."
14293,"You think you can do what he can't, and I'll sell it to you. Then you're free to run off to him with it, if you like."
14295,The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.
14296,"I admit, I doubted you, but no more. You've made a dragon submit to your will. A feat to rival the legendary Olaf One-Eye! What glory!"
14297,Biggest damn spiders I've ever seen.
14298,We recently heard she'd been killed... I... I find it difficult to talk about. Perhaps you'd be better off speaking to my parents about it.
14299,Go on. Get lost.
14300,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
14304,"Old ruins. Nordic, I think."
14310,These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.
14311,I'll be sure to put in a good word for you if I get back to Solitude first.
14312,"That went pretty well, all things considered."
14319,"At long last, Windhelm is free. No longer must we suffer persecution at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak."
14323,"Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it."
14324,By the gods...
14329,"Start at the beginning, as usual."
14332,"There are no heroes in this war. Even with Ulfric here in Solitude, there are no winners to be had. No real conclusion."
14336,"With Lisbet gone, I'll be taking care of you."
14337,Eorlund Gray-Mane was a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor. Now he's dead.
14343,I find your presence... unnerving. Please depart.
14344,Hmph. Been awhile since I've actually cleaved someone in two. Forgot how hard it was to get the scimitar back out.
14346,Magic. Foul magic...
14349,I can't express how much easier you've made my job.
14350,"However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold."
14353,More souls are needed for the Star. The last one died before he could be harvested.
14356,"Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him."
14357,"When the Stormcloaks took control of Whiterun, it was a victory for all true Nords."
14359,By Sithis.
14360,"We are all up to something, my dear. All is as it should be."
14361,"It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long."
14365,A citizen of the Reach has been kidnapped.
14369,"The Companions let me fight for gold, and so I fight."
14370,"Have you, by chance, seen my research notes? I seem to have misplaced them."
14371,This is really quite a nice town when you get down to it. Just look at the view!
14373,Mathies is a kind and wise man. The Nords could use more like him. So could the Imperials.
14378,Whatever I don't already know. 
14383,You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.
14384,So who's winning now?
14387,"I've got nothing against it, but for me, the promise of coin is what feeds my blade."
14388,"Which means you need to look the part, and not be armed to the teeth. Here, put this on."
14390,Can't say I ever much liked the idea of the Empire telling us what to do an' how to do it.
14393,Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.
14394,Joric will be what Joric will be. Give it time.
14397,Sometimes I wonder if my aunts are right about my father -- he does seem weak.
14399,Right. Well?
14400,"Shadr, that's so sweet... I'd love to."
14402,What macabre mysteries would these tools reveal if they could but speak?
14404,May the strength and truth of your Voice serve you well. Breath and focus.
14405,"It is when my customers waste time chatting, and not buying."
14407,"Do... do you want something? Look, if you ain't gonna talk, or spare no coin, just go away... "
14412,"Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild."
14413,I must have broken five or six pickaxes in the last few months alone.
14418,"Returning to High Rock. Our shepherd lost his way, and I fear Peryite's wrath may consume those who remain with him."
14420,"It's a simple ceremony, but it'll do. You're here. That's enough."
14421,How I envy you. I can only imagine the excitement of seeing history through the eyes of another!
14424,"Why, thank you. You are most courteous."
14428,Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.
14429,"Oh, yes, right, of course!"
14431,"None of what he collected tasted as good as your Spiced Wine, Evette."
14433,I see that you have already begun to learn the Whirlwind Sprint Shout.
14436,"I trust them completely, because I understand them."
14441,You have an Elder Scroll? You?
14442,"No. I'll tell you, Wilhelm, if I could sweep her away from here tomorrow I'd do it, but Klimmek still has so much to learn."
14446,"What troubles you, darling?"
14447,Do you believe this old hag?
14449,"Names mean nothing to our Lord. She only cares for those who care for themselves, whose hearts are full of purpose, whose lives are full of deeds."
14452,Thanks. I only wish Camilla was here to see it.
14453,"I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore."
14454,Are you prepared for tonight's hunt?
14455,"If I see you sneaking off with even one speck of silver, I'll break your leg and throw you into the river."
14457,I hope the tower holds out until we get there.
14458,Filthy fetcher!
14460,Hiya! What's your name? Are you visiting? What do you do?
14461,I need to get into my traveling gear. Give me a minute and I'll be ready.
14462,"But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it importance beyond what we're certain of."
14464,I've had just about all I'm willing to take from you. What is it?
14466,Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all. 
14468,"You know what I mean. Tell your boss that rough is rough, but when someone pulls a dagger fun time is over."
14473,"I'll draft a letter to Rythe. If you could have it sent to Cheydinhal for me, that would make up for your blunder."
14475,May your will carve itself upon the world.
14479,The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose.
14485,Sky guard you.
14488,"Secondly, how can anyone forget wards? They have become essential to any mage working in dangerous situations."
14493,"I want you to talk to Sibbi for me. Then, I want you to bring me Frost and the Lineage Papers that prove the horse's worth."
14495,"In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly. How about the Reach? Gaining control of the silver mines would be invaluable."
14501,"I told you to weed the garden by sunset, and you didn't do it. Now you're in big trouble!"
14505,"Maven's disappointed that Ingun's heart isn't in the family business, but she says ""Ingun still has her uses."" Not sure what that means."
14507,Khajiit will follow.
14509,"Ha! I'm afraid the loot's already been moved. You've been useful to the Blackbloods, though. You've earned a quick death."
14510,I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.
14512,"Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead."
14513,Something I can help with or do you just want to talk?
14517,A citizen of Haafingar has asked for our help.
14518,"Good. Maybe he's realized he's beaten. The way things are going, we'll be knocking at the gates of Solitude itself before too long."
14525,Be careful with Sapphire. She's mixes with all sorts of nasty people.
14528,(growl)
14529,The attacks he makes on himself can be seen here fully. They are always carried out on the weakest part of his fragile self.
14531,I'm sorry. What would you like to talk about?
14532,Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...
14533,"I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give up and go home."
14535,Right. See you around.
14539,"Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the guards."
14540,"I'm sorry mother, I just want to know more about him. You never tell me anything!"
14541,"And I'm busy. You help me out, and I'll help you out. That's just how it is."
14542,Shoot the middle target.
14543,Please... mercy...
14544,Don't just walk away from me! Where do you think you're going?
14547,"Ooh, cocky."
14549,"It's been a while now. I miss him, but it's clear he's not coming back."
14553,Hmph. Pity. I had hoped to obtain even a modicum of justice.
14554,This godsforsaken war is dividing our people and destroying our land.
14558,She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...
14560,I am Master Arngeir. I speak for the Greybeards.
14561,"No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me."
14562,Last we have deathbell which only grows in marshy tundra terrain. Its inverted bluish-purple flower bunches are unmistakable.
14563,Tell me about the Great War. I hear you were in the battle of...
14567,"We both own the Pawned Prawn together, but he's singlehandedly kept the place running despite all our problems."
14568,"It's tough to keep track of Hrefna. If her father wasn't such a snowback, he'd be around to help out."
14572,"But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude?"
14573,Go where the challenge is greatest.
14574,You have done well.
14575,"Used to run with a bandit clan in The Pale. Turns out I didn't like them and they didn't like me, so we parted ways."
14576,Gulum-Ei started to get greedy and cut us out of the deal. Almost can't say I blame the scaly bastard.
14577,I can't imagine Skald ever being young.
14578,"Wuuthrad is a relic of Ysgramor. Through that weapon, we trace our line straight to the first harbinger of makind in this land."
14585, 
14587,Now you're talking.
14588,You're needed in Hjaalmarch. There's much to be done.
14593,Gods... the pain...
14598,"Why a little boy would want to contact a group of murderers is beyond me, but he is inviting evil into this city."
14599,Let those soldiers come here! You've never seen me throw incense. I could fell a giant.
14605,"You'd really risk your life for a stranger's honor? I don't even know what to say. Thank you, my friend. I'll wait here."
14606,There is a copse of elms to the east. We could really use that wood.
14608,"In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize his claim."
14614,"Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from the bodies."
14615,"Well, if he wants to stand outside the protection of the Empire, fine. Let Ulfric pillage his city."
14617,"His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in Imperial policy."
14618,So endeth the lesson.
14621,Please...
14622,We want compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
14624,"I'd... appreciate if you kept my opinion between us. The last thing I want to do is have my parents ""lose"" another child."
14633,Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!
14635,"The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn."
14642,"You going to lose horribly, and then say you let me win?"
14646,I apologize for the disruption to such a festive occasion.
14647,"The sealed letter explains everything else, in detail. It should be delivered to your superior. Whomever that may be."
14648,"Careful if you cross the river to the east. Old Hajvarr Iron-Hand and his brigands are holed up in that cave, White River Watch."
14649,"Yes, yes it is."
14651,I'm afraid your bargaining without the metal to back it up.
14653,Alduin mahlaan
14658,"What is it, my friend?"
14663,Nivenor! How can you say that? He gives you everything you ask for.
14664,"What of it? It's our Inn, and they cause him no harm."
14670,"You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we have not spoken."
14678,I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it.
14679,Toor...Shul!
14681,You were weak. Now you are dead. What signs have you left of your passing for us to remember you by?
14683, 
14684,You dare challenge me?
14685,What's going on out there? What happened?
14687,Here we go.
14688,I've spent a long time building up a list of contacts for goods from all over Tamriel.
14692,"Pardon me, milord. Would you care to hear me play my lute?"
14693,We hunt together.
14696,"I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him."
14700,"Alright, if it's a fight you want. You've got it."
14706,It's nice to receive good news for a change. Did you recover anything else from the warehouse worth mentioning?
14712,"Okay, I'll go now."
14713,Anavchnzel is waiting.
14714,"Look, I've got training to get to."
14715,"No, mother. It's no wonder our enemies fear the sight of an Orc warrior."
14716,Always good talking to you... friend.
14718,"The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the hold."
14720,"The Silver-Bloods pay me, let me crack a few skulls, and keep the guards off my back. That's all I need."
14722,The Eyes would go a long way in helping get the Guild back on its feet.
14723,"Why are you here, outsider?"
14724,You're the Dragonborn aren't you?
14729,You're going to Fort Neugrad.
14734,"Good, you're finally here."
14736,Hurry over to our military camp tucked away in the Reach. Ulfric's been enjoying those silver mines for far too long.
14738,Very good... Let's see what you have here.
14746,Not lately. Why?
14748,It's very important to Huki that all the battles are fair. What's more important to me is that my pay is fair.
14749,"Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again."
14750,"At first I don't know why he picked me. I never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!"
14758,"First, we need to limit Stormcloak capacity and send them a not so subtle message by sabotaging a resource they claim to control."
14759,"You're a real friend saving this mead from her. Here, let me show you how to block a punch that might be coming from some angry spouse, huh?"
14760,"Ha! And neither are you, eh? Good to see another Redguard. I like to think we bring a little heat to this frozen wasteland."
14764,But you'll understand that soon enough.
14769,"They laughed at me again, Dinya. They simply don't understand."
14771,And we've done as much as we can to prepare for that.
14772,But stopping Alduin is one thing. Helping you wipe out dragons again is quite another.
14773,General Tullius...
14775,"Yes, show yourself to us. Until that day, we will continue to devote our lives to you and suffer for you."
14777,"They call her ""the Skinner."""
14779,I want to know what I'm dealing with before I start tearing it out of the ground.
14786,"I was just getting used to that ghost being here, and poof, now he's gone."
14788,What about being loyal to his wife?
14791,"Yes, I've no doubt of its gravity. This, however, is a matter that cannot wait."
14792, 
14793,"Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish."
14795,I'll just be tending the museum if you need me.
14799,Thank you. Let me show you some tricks around the forge.
14803,No! That urn was priceless!
14804,I learned that a matron who had served for House Telvanni had escaped Morrowind during the Accession War.
14806,"So if you're willing to perform one more service for the Company, we could put this matter behind us for good."
14809,Bow and arrows for the mighty huntsman.
14812,"Strength and steel are well and good, but magic is the true power in this world."
14815,"Ah, well, if Hadvar vouches for you I guess it must be all right."
14817,"You know, maybe I was wrong about you after all. Anyone who's smart enough to shut up and listen can't be all bad."
14830,"Don't worry, I'll treat those shipments as if I owned them myself."
14831,How's business today?
14833,Now get going before Sabjorn grows a brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.
14834,Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively before dying. My duty in life and in death is to make sure he stays in this tomb for eternity.
14837,Calcelmo? Is he interested in Faleen? That sly old codger. I should have guessed.
14838,They seem to when you're around Silana.
14844,He is with me.
14845,They have always sought to turn the Dragonborn from the path of wisdom.
14847,I'd like to know why you're wasting time asking about it when you should already be on your way.
14852,"I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. But more importantly, I made this Sanctuary some much needed gold. In the end, that's all that matters."
14853,"If you see anything you like, just let me know and I'll glad offer you a discount."
14856,"At last, a worthy opponent!"
14857,Word is the College of Mages is back to normal. If there's such a thing for that lot.
14858,But wait. What about soul reversal? You must be aware of the consequences when using the apparatus near an open magic field.
14859,The entrance to a dwarven city. All manner of strange traps and machines will be inside.
14860,I hope you brought a little something for me.
14862,Murdered! In cold blood!
14863,"Here, this should suffice as your cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
14864,"Tell me, sister. Are the stories true?"
14865,You idiot! We have to cover your mess up and that costs us gold... which means you don't get any.
14867,Tiid...
14869,"Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in Dead Man's Respite."
14870,"Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then!"
14871,"Hopefully small things that fit inside pockets, and will not be noticed if they are missing."
14873,"Told you that, did he?"
14874,"May I just say, it's a pleasure to have you leading the College. Really."
14876,"Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and his drinking soaked up whatever coin we had."
14877,"I want you to know I don't trust you, Madena. And I'll be watching you."
14879,But do not make the mistake of underestimating the Legion. Plenty of them are Nords same as us.
14882,I was sent here because someone said I was a Forsworn.
14883,"My friend Maven and I - have you met Maven, in Riften? - we know our place in this world. Know the place of others, too."
14886,"The architecture of this temple is marvelous. Have you ever seen stonework like this, Delphine?"
14887,"Bottom line - respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into place."
14891,"""Saadia"", as you know her, is wanted by the noble houses of Taneth for treason. We were hired to see her returned to Hammerfell for her crimes."
14895,Meet me there. We will fight our way to Namira's embrace together. 
14898,"I fought in the Great War. I cut enough young lives short, I'm not going to do it again."
14900,Sift through the ashes that others are too fearful to touch. See what they tell you.
14903,"One day he simply ran out to me in the field, excited that he'd made some sort of a breakthrough and he was going to head out on another trip."
14905,"We Gray-Manes got just as much to be proud of as them Battle-Borns, but you won't see us with our noses in the air."
14911,Call yourself a warrior?
14913,"Guard! My fine's been paid, now set me free!"
14915,"Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an age long since passed. Astrid is my matron now."
14918,See if you can drop in on this dealer of poison and convince him to close down his operation permanently.
14919,"Hafrumph! Well then, if you're going to be like that... Perhaps it's best I take my leave. A good day to you sir. I said good day!"
14921,Looking for something?
14927,I'd give my eye teeth if it meant getting those damn spiders out of the mine!
14930,"That's it. That's it! I don't know who you are, but you may have just saved this little project..."
14931,Take my beacon to the mount above Kilkreath.
14933,Damn right. Just like all true sons of Skyrim should.
14934,See? She agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
14937,"People are having nightmares they swear are real. They go to bed, but they wake up more tired than yesterday."
14938,It's no wonder she fled in the middle of the night.
14939,"Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price."
14941,Ra'jirr was always dragging her into things.
14944,"A Jarl has many duties. Attending parties isn't the most important one, but neither is it unpleasant."
14945,J'zargo continues to struggle with wards. You have time to practice?
14947,Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes.
14955,Let's not talk about this over dinner.
14957,"Well, if it works in the one case, why not the other? Don't you want to at least give it a try?"
14959,"The Jarl has put out a bounty on some bandits. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
14960,I dream about those days still. Except I'm not me. I can see myself there and I try to stop what I know is going to happen but...
14963,"Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord."
14965,"Thank you. Please, take this for your efforts."
14968,"Now that it's upon us, I'm rather looking forward to the challenge. I'll be famouser than Olaf One-Eye!"
14969,"I may have lost a drop or two of blood. Truth is, I'm not going anywhere like this. Hurts to breathe."
14972,"""Sir""? How quaint."
14973,The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to claim Gallus's former position as Guild Master.
14974,Are you a stranger?
14975,Do yourself a favor and don't have children. They're good for nothing at all.
14976,I cannot protect you if you murder us. This is the only warning you will receive.
14978,"Have faith, mortal. I will be watching over you."
14979,The poor child is probably beggin' for us to string up her murderin' father.
14981,Then you leave me no choice!
14983,"Well, it's a... minor stain on the College's reputation. One of many, unfortunately."
14989,"The city hasn't changed that much, dear. Same old dwarven stones gathering the same old moss."
14990,"And I'm a porter with no shipments coming in. You're not getting any coin from me, Degaine."
14992,"Those Thalmor are elves, too. I bet they're working together."
14999,Careful. Riften's not the safest place for a nighttime stroll.
15002,Um...this place looks dangerous.
15012,"You see, right here. Sky Haven Temple, constructed around one of the main Akaviri military camps in the Reach, during their conquest of Skyrim."
15013,We did! Keep your eyes peeled. I don't think we're alone. You check the entrance. I'm going to look over here.
15016,"I shouldn't have taken them, I know! It was stupid. I was stupid. It won't happen again."
15018,I cannot be beaten!
15021,You mean Hildolf the Skull-Splitter? Remember when we rounded up the townspeople and dragged him out of that cave?
15025,Scholars from around the world will come here one day.
15028,And guess who gets to run the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.
15034,Perfect. This is just what I needed. Here's some gold for your time.
15036,"Well... yes. I mean, all of the gold didn't come from me. I have a silent partner that helped with the finances."
15037,"You're sure? When you see Giruad, ask for a tip. I'm sure he'll be in a good mood after reading this."
15039,Come. Face your end.
15042,"Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy."
15047,"You'd just spend your time here, bossing me around and yelling for more drinks. You're practically retired already..."
15053,Hurry up and tell Lucan you have the claw. He'll be so excited!
15054,Then that is my task.
15055,"You should take more care, leaving things lying about. Here."
15056,"Painting won't put food on the table, but our crops will. Be patient Aduri... it will happen someday, I promise."
15057,That put a spring in my step.
15061,Please! You mustn't think I had anything to do with that! I wanted the Emperor dead! The true Emperor! I still do! It was Maro! He...
15064,"It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our bleeding homeland. What do they want?"
15070,Look. Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?
15072,That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party without raising the alarm.
15078,"If there was someone else Ulfric could trust with all this planning nonsense, I'd be out there breaking heads with the rest of you."
15080,The impertinence! You never would have talked to me like that when I was Jarl.
15083,We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
15085,You damn well better.
15090,Seems like most of these are nine parts fiction.
15092,I want to see you when you're done working.
15093,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
15094,"Got a witchhunter in town, from the Priesthood of Stendarr. Keeps asking questions about that old abandoned house."
15095,"The rumors were true! You carry the one weapon Eldergleam fears - Nettlebane. I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it."
15096,"I wonder if we should finally leave Markarth. These dragon attacks, I think Skyrim is cursed."
15102,Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?
15103,"The Miasma? But, brother..."
15107,Can't a woman get a moment to herself? Leave me!
15112,And what about Jarl Erikur?
15113,There's two more of them ahead.
15114,A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have long believed you would prevail.
15115,"I can't believe this is happening, lass."
15118,Blessing of Arkay to you for your help.
15119,"This is the happiest day of my life. Where should we live? My home is your home now, of course."
15122,My cousin's stationed out at the watchtower. I hope he's all right.
15124,Is it safe now?
15126,"You know that I support the Empire, as we all do. However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks."
15128,Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have no more trouble from me.
15129,"First, if we can assassinate their commander, we'll be able to strike them while they're busy tucking their tails between their legs."
15134,"Ah, now I understand. This is about that my father's hidden cache, isn't it? The dowry for my wedding."
15140,Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.
15142,"So, Arniel. How's that little project of yours coming along? Any progress worth mentioning?"
15147,Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one of our largest clients.
15148,Sssh. It's all right. You don't need to say anymore. I had no idea you were so... nuanced.
15149,And me and Mila used to climb up on the roof of Dragonsreach and look for birds' eggs.
15151,Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.
15154,I'm taking you out of the game for now. No jobs will be offered and you won't be able to fence your goods.
15158,The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
15164,Where did you learn of a Shout used to defeat Alduin?
15166,Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?
15167,"Good morning, Assur. What do you want to do today?"
15168,I'm sure he will prove most useful.
15171,Real men prove their love. Words are as empty as the air they run through.
15172,"And, there's only one man who can give us what we need - Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften."
15180,I've spoken to Brynjolf and he assures me it'll be taken care of.
15181,"I respectfully disagree, sir. Stendarr and Zenithar may demand strength from them, but Mara and Dibella demand compassion from us."
15186,Who else gains from that but the Thalmor?
15188,"I have tasted the voices of Alduin's allies on the wind. Pogaan nahlaas, vokrii wah jun."
15189,Running won't save you.
15194,"I don't think that's needed, Horik. It's the same strategy we used for every major defense during the Great War. It'll serve just as well now."
15200,No.
15201,"Dibella's Heart, son, I hope not."
15204,"In the southwest reaches of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view."
15206,"To the Stormcloaks, this was viewed as the moment when the Empire became unworthy of the allegiance of any true Nord."
15207,"Here, this is for you."
15208,Untie me. Now.
15209,I suppose you think you're better than me because you can do that?
15211,The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons.
15213,"Always such a model for decency in these troubled times, Yngvar."
15216,I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.
15220,"When I was very young, I was sent to Skingrad in Cyrodiil to study with him."
15221,"No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of."
15222,"This was a mighty deed! The doom of Alduin encompassed at last, and cleansed is Sovngarde of his evil snare."
15223,"Good to see you, dear."
15226,"Ah, hello my Nord friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
15229,What just happened?
15234,"Oh, and I wasn't entirely truthful before. This is actually going to hurt a lot. You see, you have to be dead in order for the spell to take hold."
15240,Do you have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to cost me?
15243,The dwarves were masters at subterranean construction... these ruins show  only a fraction of their capabilities.
15245,You have a job to do.
15248,"This is your chance, Dovahkiin! Strike with all your force!"
15255,I'm trying to speak to the Jarl.
15257,"Take care, friend."
15258,"Now, stand aside, there's work to be done."
15261,"Don't worry, my parties are always well-stocked with the finest food and drink available in this country."
15264,"And take out resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, with a little sabotage."
15266,Best if... you didn't mention to anyone that you saw me here.
15269,"Luckily Windhelm is cold, so the dead don't rot as quickly. Sometimes the burial has to wait for the ground to thaw, though."
15270,I've really got to be going.
15272,"Aunt Haelga, why you... demean yourself with these people you barely know? They show no real love for you."
15273,"What? Were you hoping to claim this house for yourself? Well, the Aretinos always liked me, so I think I'm family enough to take up here."
15275,Did you know Vittoria's getting married? They say the Emperor might even come to Skyrim for the wedding!
15280,Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons but Inge... Dean Six Fingers... says I'm quite good with the flute.
15282,"Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to turn the rings so the door will open."
15284,Aren't you already running a job for Vilkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
15289,Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage? Things like that tend to get around.
15294,"Ah! I've heard of this Shouting, but never seen it. Fascinating..."
15295,You can give this house a once over. I hear they're fairly well-off and probably have lots of good stuff ripe for the picking. Sound good?
15296,Traveling in the Reach is dangerous. You need a good carriage.
15299,I just can't believe that Ulfric is gone. Skyrim will never be free now.
15300,But now it's too late for escape. The dragon is upon me - fire and darkness descending like a thunderbolt.
15301,"That hammer... Why that's Aegisbane, heirloom of Clan Shatter-Shield! Last I heard, it was stolen by a couple of swindlers. Alain and... Muiri. Yeah."
15303,Know any tales of nobility and courage? I'm keen to record them.
15304,I hope you come up with that gold soon.
15305,"Fine, here you go."
15308,The crucial nature is pure apparent. Mundane sight traded for another sort.
15309,"I hear your crops sold well at the market. Well done, Ennis."
15311,I hope one day to find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that.
15314,"Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength."
15316,Why don't you see if Arch-Mage Aren is interested in joining me for a meal?
15319,"I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to, you know... clean up the mess."
15320,"Ilas-tei was practicing Illusions spells. She was having trouble with the calm spells, I believe, but only ever worked with skeevers."
15322,"Speak with the Blasphemous Priest at the Temple of Kynareth, in Whiterun. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!"
15324,"I'm afraid not, little fairy. The fruit has about another day left before it spoils. We've got to sell as much as we can, as soon as we can."
15329,"Anything you say, Mother."
15331,I'm so sorry. I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future.
15333,Actually just a bottle for me today. I'm thinking of giving it to Vivienne.
15336,"The Twilight watches us all, guardian."
15339,"Damn it, I lost my page..."
15340,You seem like such a nice person. I'd love to hear more about you.
15342,"Yes, my Jarl."
15343,I spend every waking moment making sure the mine is put to good use.
15346,I feel better already.
15350,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
15351,"That is ""Feim."" Let that meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will find that your spirit will give you more strength."
15355,"Kynareth save us, here he comes again..."
15362,I am a traveler. A pilgrim. I follow the voice of Kynareth wherever it can be heard. 
15363,Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
15364, 
15365,"Come now, dear husband. You above all people should know what I'm capable of."
15367,"Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey. We don't know what's inside..."
15369,Is that so...?
15372,You assured me this place was clean! I'll see... see to it that you remain in irons for the rest of your days!
15373,"That is where I learned to cook, and where I belong. Not here, with all these dogs."
15377,This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.
15379,I'll show you a real fight!
15380,Damn you!
15386,Don't just stand there! Kill her!
15387,"Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you."
15394,"Don't get any ideas. We're here on official business, remember?"
15396,This isn't happening!
15398,"Two things I have for you. Two shapes. One edged, one round."
15401,The other chief!
15406,"What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns."
15409,"Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold."
15410,Are you working with the Battle-Borns? Speak now before I put you in the ground!
15412,I don't like this place. It feels like we're being... watched.
15414,We're off to a good start.
15416,We bring honor and glory to ourselves and each other.
15419,"It's a wonderful house, my love. If you don't mind, I'm going to start a small store. Something to do whenever you're on the road."
15421,"Be careful, there's no telling what lurks within these walls."
15425,Got to admire the chops it takes to walk around like that.
15427,Kematu is west of Whiterun. It's an unassuming little cave called Swindler's Den.
15430,"I admit, I've never felt entirely at ease in the Thalmor embassy."
15431,My money's on the big one.
15432,"Cold as the inside of an ice wraith. That and some Imperials are camped out around the entrance, staying nice and warm around their fires."
15433,"It should hurt. A lot. But I'm not paying for murder. Oh, if you're caught, it's not my problem."
15434,I help my husband Rustleif run the forge. He's a marvel with steel.
15435,"Keep up the effort, boy. Eyes on the horizon, always."
15437,I got a new order in for shields. I'm gonna need some hardwood planks. None of that soft pine this time.
15438,My uncle died. Things won't be the same without him.
15440,Already did. Part of the reason I'm living out here now. Thanks for offering though.
15441,You can use Nettlebane to retrieve some of its sap.
15442,Jarl Hrongar...
15443,"I'm too old to work, but that don't make me too old to drink."
15444,"And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing, I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun."
15445,"It worked, then? Let me see!"
15448,You? An outsider? I'd sooner slit my own throat than accept help from you.
15449,There it is!  On the table.
15452,"In fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments."
15453,I'll water the ground with your blood.
15457,"To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future."
15459,"They aren't my ""people."" I'm with the Empire because they pay me. And that means I'm out here, and you're in there. So shut up, scum!"
15465,"Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to go ask J'zargo."
15466,Hardly likely.
15468,I could run this ship better than that boy who calls himself a captain. Maybe one day I'll do something about it.
15469,Is that all you've got?
15475,"Need a blade? You should talk to Adrianne, at the forge."
15477,"If you see my father Octieve around, stay clear. He'll only ask you for money or mead."
15479,"It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why."
15483,You should be aware that many apply but we accept very few people.
15484,"There's little time for talk, what do you want?"
15488,What in the world...
15492,"Welcome to the Legion, auxiliary. Listen up."
15493,I think you play beautifully. It would be a shame if you stopped.
15494, 
15495,You leave him alone. I don't want to hear Skaggi telling me you've been bothering him again!
15500,My thanks!
15501,It was only 20 years back that the Reachmen rebelled. Even took control of Markarth itself for a time.
15502,And that's why I'm the best.
15504,"Next time you decide to pull a stunt like that again, just remember how much it hurt to give this away."
15507,"Mara forgives you, my child."
15508,By the nine!
15510,"Well, King... If you don't mind, we'll just take that crown of yours and be on our way."
15511,Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!
15512,"It's pretty simple. Ulfric founded the Stormcloaks years ago, as a sort of private army to advance his ambitions."
15513,"Welcome to the Winking Skeever, friend."
15514,It will be a good day. I can feel it in my gut.
15515,Was there something else?
15516,"A curious figure. Unrepentantly evil and nasty, of course, but also astonishingly brilliant, and obviously quite a necromancer at her end."
15517,"Hey, that's my lint! Ha, Cicero is just joking. You can have it."
15518,Need some sort of toxin for a special occasion? That's where I come in.
15519,"But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. So long since it's tasted blood. Until you came."
15520,"We stand out here in the cold, as brothers, warmed by the knowledge that we fight for the rights of every free citizen of the Empire."
15522,"Now then. Here's my invitation, I don't have a poisoned dagger strapped to my thigh, et cetera, et cetera."
15523,"Mom says the Empire is mean, but I don't think they're that bad."
15524,"Ralof... get away from there, fool!"
15526,Looking for a place to stay?
15527,"You'd think so, wouldn't you? I'm fine. Thank you for asking."
15528,I've had to be careful handling those blade shards you found. They're each sharp enough to sever a finger with no effort.
15531,"Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath."
15532,How could I forget? That old alpha male almost took off my leg.
15535,"Seems like a noble cause, I'll look it over."
15536,Guess it was nothing after all.
15537,I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.
15540,I... I feel terrible about what happened. About what I did. It would probably be best for everyone if I just went away.
15541,...retire some day... get myself an island...
15542,"Look, I'll make this simple for you."
15544,"Ah, well I guess it was unlikely. I'm sorry to waste your time."
15545,"Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away."
15546,"So Mikael, what'll it be tonight, hmm? Something upbeat? A Breton jig maybe?"
15547,"I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you."
15549,Let's wait until Brynjolf's here before we begin.
15550,Damn the Jarls.
15551,Wonderful. I hadn't really hoped to run in to someone who had been there.
15552,"I might not be as big as some of my fellow Nords, but in a fight they can barely lay a hand on me."
15553,"You... you know the Whispering Lady, don't you. I can tell."
15554,"But it's more than that. Nazeem is obsessed with this civil war, as is all of Skyrim. I swear, it will consume us all."
15555,Hmph. Plenty.
15556,What are you out here talking to me for? Party's inside.
15557,"Sure it is, Lod. Sure it is."
15558, 
15561,It's not safe around here. There's thieves out there looking to steal everything you own.
15563,The College is not the only place to learn about magic.
15564,I'm afraid you do.
15567,"Nice try, but my mother's already got me in jail. Maybe you should try that one on Letrush."
15569,"Where I belong is back aboard my ship, on the Abecean."
15570,But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
15571,"I obviously don't have anything here, but... there's a hidden stash in the Lodge. And I did manage to hold on to the key..."
15572,"When I saw the little girl, I was just... I could feel it coming on. I could taste the... I needed to hunt."
15574,What did you say? I ought to break off one of those tusks and use it as my drinking horn!
15576,"Sure - take advantage of the guy in jail. Okay, fine. I can make the deal sweeter."
15577,Best get rid of the ones we see. Just in case.
15578,Don't worry. We'll take good care of your city when you're gone.
15579,Ooohh... The things I could do now...
15580,Will do.
15582,Keep an eye out for Stormcloak spies.
15584,I miss the glory days of this place. We had more coin stacked in the vaults than we even knew what to do with.
15585,Arms and armor! Forged by a master craftsman!
15587,"About the same as everyone else. They're the cat-folk of Elsweyr. Great warriors, good traders."
15589, 
15591,Saffir!
15592,"If your allegiance lies with the Empire, we haven't much to discuss."
15593,"Done, then? This way!"
15594,Well what did you go dropping it for? Got my hopes up for nothin'...
15595,"Now go and make us some coin, lass!"
15597,I was hoping you would say that.
15599,"Years back, I had to ferret away some booty nearby. We'd sunk an Imperial Galleon off the coast. Good plunder, but we needed to travel light."
15601,Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
15603,"The struggle between Olaf and the dragon culminated in a mighty duel atop Mount Anthor, with Olaf the victor."
15604,"You're the one with the staff, my dear."
15606,"Of course, I've been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and feel free to share the fruits of my labor."
15607,"We have lived in Skyrim since before the Nords came. Our way is simple, all work to make the tribe strong."
15610,"Sir, they're on the move. They'll be at the gates at any moment!"
15611,"The prophecy which brought the Akaviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn."
15612,"You never were able to see the forest for the trees, were you?"
15614,I swear Elenwen holds these parties just to make the Empire look bad. Almost makes me want to join the Stormcloaks.
15615,The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed.
15616,Anything you can find would be of great help. Good luck.
15618,"Welcome. I don't believe we've met. I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim."
15619,Will do.
15620,Here's where you need to go.
15624,Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
15625,"I've seen my share of black magic, but that's all in the past now."
15628,Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.
15629,"Please, let me out of here!"
15630,You want this one to become a Blade? You're sure?
15631,J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins.
15632,I thought I was clear when I said I didn't know.
15634,Is that the murderer?
15636,Right... Helgen..
15638,"Violent one, huh? Best keep that to yourself, new blood. Others find out, they'll consider that a challenge."
15640,No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it.
15641,It probably took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build one of those things.
15646,"Your schedule is always clear, Arch-Mage. I see to that."
15647,This next song goes out to the Dragonborn. The savior of Skyrim.
15648,This is an ode to Skyrim's staunch protectors... the Imperials.
15649,This is an ode to Skyrim's truest sons and daughters... the Stormcloaks.
15650,"Honor me with a task, outlander. Bring the sword to my daughter, if you see her. It'll be all she needs to know."
15651,This is a local favorite and one of the first songs I ever learned. Ragnar the Red.
15654,"No, it can't be... oh my... and all this time, I was thinking he'd been unfaithful to me. I feel so stupid."
15655,"I've been talking to my sources around the holds, and think I may have heard where one of them lives."
15656,"Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today."
15661,But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
15665,I've dispatched a rider to Helgen. We'll know soon enough.
15666,"Make it quick, then. I don't want your stink driving my customers away."
15667,"Well, with the Falmer skulking around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to come with me."
15668,Peace and prosperity are all the good folk of Rorikstead want in life.
15669,"Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself."
15670,"I got the message. Consider it forgotten, boss."
15671,"I hid here in Solitude for a long time but war, war follows a man until it's done with him."
15673,Surely you wouldn't miss a few scales... or a small amount of blood...
15674,Should have figured Astrid would send you.
15675,You're right. We're not alone.
15676,It's a fundamental rule of magic and it would be ridiculous. You can't draw from harmonic energy without a soul siphon.
15677,Then there's a little matter of some recruiting. I have someone in mind I'd like to join our campaign.
15678,"Is it getting hot, or is it just me?"
15680,"No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure."
15681,Let's talk about it some other time.
15682,Let's do this. Summon this dragon of yours.
15683,"I owe you my life, friend."
15688,"That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle, your blood must be as ours."
15689,"That attitude would get you far, if you were some stuffy merchant or a Jarl's footstool."
15690,"It was one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain."
15691,"Your makin' a name for yourself, that's for sure. But more important, you're makin' a name for the Guild. Keep it up."
15692,Thank you.
15694,"My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad.  "
15696,My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated.
15699,"Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the hold's funds are at this time?"
15700,"By Imperial Law banning Talos, we have the right to do whatever we want.  "
15701,"I had my years of war and fighting. Senseless, all of it. All I want now is a rake and a patch of good soil. "
15702,"We're looking to recover an heirloom for a client. They claim ownership of it, and as long as they're paying we don't really care. You in?"
15704,"Please, let me offer you this key. It unlocks my strongbox under my stand in the marketplace. Help yourself to anything inside."
15705,"Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed."
15709,"Mine is not a popular position, but someone needs to keep things running smoothly around here."
15710,Let me see that!
15711,Talk to me again when you've cleaned up your mess.
15713,"He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time."
15715,Just calm down. I'll tell you everything.
15716,Don't think I'm being paid already? Get lost.
15717,But never mind all that. We've got a job to do.
15719,Bolar and I will tell you. 
15721,You just find that lying around? Must be your lucky day.
15724,"Hello, dear husband. Have you brought more silver jewelry for me to sell?"
15725,Save it for the battlefield.
15726,"If you were to bring me the deed to Goldenglow Estate, so I was the full owner, that would be a step in the right direction."
15727,"When you're ready, I'll keep the rest of your gear safe until you get back."
15729,Prepare yourself.
15730,"Shipment of silver this month is behind. Nepos is to blame, not me."
15734,"Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true."
15735,The townsfolk won't go near it. Superstitious lot.
15736,Bloody good timin'. Just got some more clients.
15737,I love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land.
15739,"Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords, would we?"
15741,Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.
15743,You're right. Sorry to bring it up.
15746,Ainethach needs to get rid of those Silver-Blood. Then maybe we can go back to work.
15748,Again?
15749,"When the weather permitted, Aerin and I would often walk the Rift's forests. The trees here are so beautiful. "
15752,"Mind you don't forget to sweep up, Julienne. The floor's looking a bit dusty."
15753,"Endon, we talked about this... Are you still disappointed in Cade's choice?"
15754,"Convince her that we'll be coming for her, and she needs to leave. Lead her to the stables outside Whiterun."
15757,"But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a hundred years."
15760,That can't be done.
15762,"What is it, Malborn?"
15765,"Nobody we know, by the smell. "
15766,They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons.
15770,"Ahhhh... No, no Elven spices. Just some salt, to preserve it. You're not afraid of salt, are you?"
15771,Thank you.
15772,"No, no no no. This can't be happening."
15773,Shut up.
15779,"I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves."
15780,I'd rather spend more time in the mine hauling up iron then doing woman's work keeping the house clean.
15783,"Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters."
15784,"That is ""Fus."" Let its meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will push the world harder than it pushes back."
15785,"Oh, you mean in that manor house? During the thunderstorm? Heh. What can I say? It happened, just like you heard."
15786,"You need anything, come see me. I'm as resourceful as I am discreet."
15788,Can I help you?
15789,Don't forget to check inside the shop if you need anything.
15790,I left his head on a pike at the wreckage of the caravan.
15791,"Imperial troops will withdraw from Winterhold, and Kraldar will return as Jarl."
15794,"Onmund is too afraid to deal with me himself, and so he's sent you."
15795,I'm going to track down that thief and murder him!
15797,"Then come for me, ""son of Skyrim."" Come for me!"
15802,Hmm? What're you doing?
15803,"There once was a stranger, with eyes full of danger, he spoke not a word, but his meaning was heard... Sing on, sweet Lurbuk, sing on!"
15805,"Alright, then."
15806,"Good thing you did for Nurelion, retrieving that phial for him before he died. Man was obsessed."
15810,"So congratulations, whoever you are, you've found the Synod. Just me, alone, surrounded by angry machines and angrier Falmer."
15812,"In your tongue, the Word simply means ""Fire."" It is change given form. Power at its most primal."
15815,It's time to act.
15817,"What do you need, my Thane?"
15818,All hail the Dragonborn!
15822,"Oh... I see. Well then, let me be just say that it's been an honor serving under you Commander Maro."
15826,Thanks!
15828,"At present, there is no confirmation of any of the various theories surrounding the nature of these stones."
15829,"I've already agreed to pay him quite handsomely for the... well, the item in question."
15831,"Come on, father, how hard can it be? They're just... big lizards. And those scales and teeth, they must be worth a fortune..."
15832,"Perhaps one day, I'll write a song about you!"
15833,I trust that this is just the begining of a long and mutually beneficial relationship.
15837,But enough talk. Come! Won't you share a drink with me and my companions?
15838,We're not quite ready to muster the final attack.
15840,Once more and I'm going to have to kill you.
15841,"I'll anoint you with the symbol of the Bear, the Sabrecat and the Mammoth. Tread carefully, these are mighty beasts."
15842,"Maybe you're not so soft, after all. Now you're ready for a real challenge."
15843,Oh! I didn't expect that!
15844,Don't just stand still to do your big wind-up blows. Which way you're moving changes what happens and can be a big advantage.
15845,That mace... get it away from me. Get it away...
15846,Why do you insist on defending that woman? All she does with her money is spend it on that Dark Elf garbage!
15850,"So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous."
15856,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
15857,You're dismissed.
15858,Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we get business.
15859,Iiz...
15860,"We've got all the miners we need, so I hope you're not here looking for work."
15861,Lo!
15862, 
15864,"Maybe, but they wouldn't taste as good as a loaf of fresh-baked pumpernickel."
15865,I promise to join you there as soon as I can.
15866,There's the man himself!
15867,"Keep your brother, and he'll keep you."
15869,Talos watch over you.
15870,Go with the gods.
15874,Shop at Belethor's for the best prices and selection. He pays me to say that.
15876,"Turn back, traveler! Terror waits within this mist."
15879,Word of advice if you ride a Narwhale. Mind the pointy end.
15881,Agh...
15884,"She is here, among us."
15885,Unnff!
15888,Alduin mahlaan
15890,Roggvir. You damn fool.
15893,Try not to?
15895,"Thank you, Madena. I appreciate your assistance."
15897,"Ah, kinsman. How my heart soars to look upon a brother Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?"
15899,I won't be married to some weak-willed Orc chieften. I'd sooner join the Legion.
15900,I offer you eternity!
15901,By the gods! What manner of power is that?
15902,Clean the rooms yourself Kleppr. It's not like you do anything important around here.
15903,"Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do."
15904,By all I hold sacred... that's a Shout! Like the Graybeards on their mountain!
15905,"Suit yourself, but you better decide what you want to do about this arrest. No one walks away for free."
15908,"All Shouts are made up of three Words of Power. As you master each Word, your Shout will become progressively stronger."
15909,Looking for shipping? We'll always offer better service than the East Empire Company.
15912,"Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?"
15915,Make love like a sabercat or crush your enemies to dust like a giant! Only a mere 20 gold coins and all this could be yours!
15917,You're going to Fort Greymoor.
15918,"Hush, Frodnar. This is no time for your games."
15920,"As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild."
15921,This is the Old Hroldan Inn. Clean beds and strong drink.
15922,Back off.
15923,Dragon!
15924,He didn't need to pick the lock.
15931,"You are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity."
15933,Let's hope we both live through this day.
15934,"Master, look. It's the Phial."
15936,"Elenwen puts a great deal of effort into these parties, and it shows."
15939,Can't say I was a great father the first time around. Now that he's here it's like a second chance. He's a good lad.
15940,Ha ha ha ha! No! Never find me!
15941,Inkpot. Stone. Bucket. Book. Knife.
15943,"Good. Wipe them out. So long as one of them is left alive, they will come for me!"
15944,Protect yourself right... buy armor from Grelka.
15945,"If not... Then call me Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. Charmed."
15948,Buy some armor and live to tell about it!
15949,"My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade. "
15951,Vegetables as crisp as a winter's morning!
15952,"Sure, I used to be a soldier... but that was child's play compared to cracking rock."
15955,"Hey, troll bait!"
15957,"The Dragonborn is different - you have an inborn ability to Shout, the same way dragons are said to."
15960,"Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?"
15961,"As I said, go speak with Gabriella. She's been assisting me with your next contract. This Emperor business, well... it does involve everyone."
15963,Cicero can talk for a moment. Just a moment. Then Mother must be... tended to.
15964,Yell all you want. It's not going to change my mind.
15965,"I want to be an adventurer like you, but my father says I can't."
15966,Fresh meats and produce! Get them before they're gone!
15967,"Find the three vessels within Valthume, then return to me. With these we can defeat him."
15968,Jewelry with legendary Argonian craftsmanship!
15969,I'm running low on Greater Soul Gems.
15975,"There's a sort of tavern down there, the Ragged Flagon. Where all the lowlifes in Riften get drunk and knife each other."
15979,"You should be more careful with the men you pick, dear."
15981,It's not that simple. Ulfric wants a Skyrim for the Nords. He doesn't trust what he calls outsiders.
15982,"I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind."
15984,"You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household."
15986,What...! Do you know who I am? I should have you taken up and flogged!
15987,"The Silver Hand. They finally had the nerve to attack Jorrvaskr. We got most of them, but I think a few stragglers made it out."
15988,I had quite the mentor. He taught me everything he know about the nirnroot and its strange properties.
15989,"It's good to see you in one piece, lad!"
15990,There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.
15995,"But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them."
15997,"This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it."
15998,Grrah!
15999,"If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on the subject. Should be on my table."
16000,"Yes, Thongvor."
16001,Go ahead and fill him in with all the details.
16004,"You're right. This is all my fault. Should we turn around, head back?"
16005,Ready to board the carriage to the embassy?
16006,"That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you."
16008,Here. Take a look for yourself. But give it back soon. It's almost time for milady's medicine.
16009,Sorry. We got nothin' to talk about. Vex will straighten you out.
16011,Change Arn's entry in the book to anything you want and they'll be forced to let him go after he serves a few weeks.
16012,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
16013,"Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones."
16016,"Throw in the Oblivion Crisis, which was caused by magic-users, and the troubles now with the Aldmeri Dominion, who are elves and magic users."
16019,"There must be a way to activate these doors deeper in the ruins. Here, take this key. It should open the doors on either side of this chamber."
16021,Delvin?
16022,I just can't fill an order that size on my own. 
16023,There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me.
16024,Speak to Falk when you have the funds. And thank you.
16025,You have more than earned the right to purchase property and take the next step to becoming a Thane.
16026,The stench in here... this place smells of death. Be on your guard.
16027,Was Jarl Ulfric with you?
16028,Falk said I could count on you.
16031,We could use someone with your skills.
16034,I'm not about to take on debts from some milk drinker I don't know.
16035,My hatred for the Empire is exceeded only by my hatred for their witch-elf puppet-masters.
16037,"Yes, when we buried my husband I wasn't able to make an offering to Talos."
16038,It was scary. It was like it was real!
16040,"Almost doesn't feel like Skyrim, being so far away from the rest of the world here."
16041,When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except Talos.
16046,Victory for Nocturnal!
16048,Falk told me what you did for us at Wolfskull cave. He says you're someone we can trust.
16049,"The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's onboard his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude Inlet. But you must hurry!"
16051,You can't hide from me!
16053,"No, I need a name that will put some fear in the hearts of my enemies. When I have some enemies, that is."
16054,All right. Keep up the good work.
16057,That's all right. Return to me if you change your mind though.
16061,By Ysmir's beard! I didn't know it was gonna be a party!
16062,"The simplest way to put it is ""knowledge,"" but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll."
16063,"Clever. To think, now I could... Well, never mind."
16065,"Of course, sir."
16067,Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.
16071,"Hey, don't you want to make this exchange?"
16072,How are you feeling?
16073,"She's not from Markarth. The air about her screamed ""outsider."""
16074,No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him?
16075,I'll meet you outside of town.
16076,Please don't leave. You must help me.
16077,Grrarrgh!
16078,I think I'll like living here.
16080,I've heard Riften's home to the worst Skyrim has to offer. I hope we don't run into any trouble while we're here.
16081,"I will, I will..."
16082,You're interrupting the performance.
16083,Looking for something?
16084,Are you ready to give me the Star?
16085,"By helping me, you're helping the good folk of Whiterun. How could I say no to that?"
16086,Stop the intruder!
16090,"I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment."
16091,"Lost, stranger?"
16092,You're making a mistake!
16094,"Look, there's a war going on, if you hadn't heard. We barely have enough soldiers to walk the streets, much less patrol every corner."
16095,I try not to think about how my uncle got all the Dwemer Centurion parts.
16101,Don't let it get me. Help!
16102,The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has.
16108,Clavicus gave him an axe.
16109,"Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it."
16110,"Thank you, Legate. In the future, I'll let you know when your opinion is needed."
16111,One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine.
16113,"Got some good pieces out here, if you're looking to buy. More inside."
16114,"I do some business with the trade caravans, and I've picked up a number of items from adventurers like yourself."
16115,Why should I pay for a repair on something I just bought?
16118,"All things are possible, my child. But I believe it is within you to succeed."
16119,I remember that axe.
16121,"If Ulfric gets his hand on that crown, it won't be a fairy tale. It'll be a problem."
16122,All this just to kill me Clavicus?
16124,"That's right. In the Second Era, Tiber Septim himself led the army that conquered Old Hroldan from the barbarians of the Reach."
16125,But at least we ended up with the damn crown. Now then...
16126,"Wait a second, there's another option here."
16129,Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.
16131,"I already told you. They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground."
16133,We should go get the axe.
16135,I wonder... what effect might your spells have?
16136,I would not complain if you returned with some Skooma. 
16139,You can't have the ring back! You made a commitment!
16140,"He speaks to us only rarely, and never to outsiders. Being allowed to see him is a great privilege."
16141,"Here you stand, talking to a still grieving widow. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind."
16142,So you don't know anything about this house?
16145,Roggi tell you about the scorcher we found under the scaffolding?
16146,"That'll be the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. He's an honorable enough man. Never done wrong by me or my kin."
16148,Ataf keeps making eyes at me. 
16149,"Something arcane. Very old, very powerful. Do you think...?"
16151,You should tell him to mind his own business.
16153,I wish you luck in finding the verse.
16154,I guess I shouldn't be surprised with the way things are going around here.
16155,Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!
16158,But there is always more to learn. I believe you are ready for the next step.
16161,"Nobody trusts those mages, way up north in their college. Gods only know what they do up there."
16165,A good story is nine parts truth and one part fiction.
16167,Who cares who worships what dead god? Give me something to make me draw my sword.
16171,Even while making parts up.
16174,It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months.
16176,Hold on. I want to hear what Irileth's saying.
16179,Then off with ya. I've got better things to do.
16182,Of course. Alduin wahlaan daanii. I would not have helped you if I thought otherwise.
16183,Welcome back to the Prawn. Let me know if you need anything.
16184,That's all for today. You're dismissed.
16185,"You get killed on account of this thing, it's not my fault. Got it?"
16186,"You see, all you need is a bit of spirit and any song can be made into a classic."
16188,"They wouldn't dare give Ulfric a fair trial. Treason, for fighting for your own people! All of Skyrim would have seen the truth then."
16189,Welcome to the Winking Skeever. Take a load off and enjoy the atmosphere.
16190,"And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it."
16192,"Welcome to the College of Winterhold. I am Faralda, one of the senior Wizards here."
16194,We never should have pulled that thing out of Saarthal.
16195,Your path has brought you to the finest fletcher in all the land.
16196,"Out of my way, kinsman."
16197,Did Harrald send you to taunt me?
16198,Come in and shut the door.
16201,"Are you scared of death? I am. I hear everything just stops... forever. It just all goes away, but you don't realize it. I don't want to die."
16202,"Wonderful. Just speak to various bards outside of the college, get there parts of the Poetic Edda and return them here to me. "
16203,"He opened the gate for Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric rides in, defeats the High King and Roggvir was the one that let him ride right back out."
16204,If only that were true.
16206,I'm going to need your help in the kitchen tomorrow.
16207,"Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways... simply are not our ways."
16208,Even the Dragonborn betrays Skyrim.
16210,Place the crystal in the center of the armillary. Then we can worry about attuning it.
16211,This is part of me. Guard it with your life. 
16214,I should think so! I'm well used to taking care of a house and the folk living in it.
16217,"A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself."
16218,"Use subtlety and suggestion to turn his thoughts to the war. You're his steward, he'll listen to you."
16221,That's it! You've collected every last verse. I can't thank you enough. This deserves a special bonus.
16222,Wonderful. Soon we'll have the latest section of the Edda complete. Keep up the good work.
16223,"I'll, uh, just take that as a compliment."
16225,But it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute. Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at Helgen.
16226,"You're not very good at this, are you."
16229,"Well, everyone's wrong. Now why don't you just shut up about it."
16236,"You know, the Winking Skeever's not just the best inn in Solitude. It's the also the only inn in Solitude."
16238,"In the meantime, I'll make myself at home in the Sanctuary. I'm sure Mother needs... tending. "
16240,I don't care! Just stay away from the soldiers and keep to your business. It's the only way we'll make it through this.
16241,Can't have a meal without meat. Come and get some here.
16243,"Right, then."
16244,Get some Spiced Wine. A Festival Favorite.
16245,"Ah, you're back."
16246,Spiced Wine here. First cup is paid for by the college.
16247,"It was you who fought your kin who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price of our freedom. "
16249,"Tasty, sugary treats!"
16250,Candy! Get your King Olaf's Festival candy!
16251,Don't let it get too close!
16253,Just one bottle per customer. Except for the man who saved the festival. Here's a couple bottles for you.
16255,Stay under cover. This is what we came for. We need to see what happens.
16261,"Come on, I won't bite."
16262,Is that... the best... you can do... 
16263,"We'll be waiting, then."
16264,"Yes, exactly. Well, I think so. It's certainly our best hope. The ancient Blades remembered much Akaviri dragonlore that has now been forgotten."
16267,Sorry... I usually have a nose for this kind of thing.
16268,You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons.
16269,That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Can't say I envy you that job.
16272,"I still need some help, if you can spare the time."
16273,"Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry."
16275,It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense. 
16280,"The other Blades? No. Best not to think what the Thalmor do to their victims, my dear."
16283,I've been writing some notes about all the Akaviri designs we've discovered. If only the Imperial Library could see my research.
16284,"Splendid! Please take a seat on the chair behind me, would you?"
16285,Go on without me. I think I need to be alone for a while.
16287,"Okay, lass. We've got these getups on... now what?"
16289,Hmph. Damn you for being right.
16290,Agh. Agh!
16294,"The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see. "
16295,Come now. You did more than just survive all those years. Your evasion of the Thalmor would be useful for future Blades to study.
16301,"So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years."
16302,You've got sixty seconds. Go.
16303,"Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?"
16304,Protect the Jarl!
16306,"You need to go inside, little cub."
16307,A new face. And a right ugly one at that. No offence.
16308,"Those flames get out of control, and you're gonna wish they hadn't."
16309,"If you know any true sons and daughters of Skyrim, tell them to head to Windhelm. Ulfric Stormcloak wants to see them."
16313,(coughing fit) Uuughhnnn...
16314,"Hemming, have you dispatched that letter I gave you yesterday?"
16315,"True, but I'm not going to be the one to try to oppose her..."
16317,Uuuuhhhnnnn... it hurts...
16318,I'm so glad Eola invited you to dinner.
16319,You lookin' for Falion? Why don't you go bother those mages at their College in Winterhold and leave my brother alone?
16321,There's a lot of history in a place like that. I'll bet these walls could tell some amazing stories.
16322,Sir...
16325,Over by that bridge!
16327,"I don't appreciate loiterers, if that's what you're here to do."
16329,"Arch-Mage, the Synod have contacted us again, asking if we've any word on their researchers. What shall I tell them?"
16331,The Lexicon had better be worth all this trouble.
16332,"On this day, our enemy will know the fullness of our determination, the true depth of our anger, and the exalted righteousness of our cause."
16333,There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I shall simply take my leave.
16335,We are the sons and daughters of Skyrim!
16336,And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.
16337,"But no! We are farmers! We are craftsmen! We are sons and daughters of shopkeepers, maid servants and soldiers! "
16338,Come now. You'll want to show up in Sovngarde refreshed. You got an eternity of merrimakin' ahead of you.
16340,Take a look.
16343,You're crazy! How dare you make such an accusation!
16344,The gods are watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And men under suns yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today.
16345,But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas.
16346,"And on that day, we will confiscate his city, and restore the rule of law to his lands."
16347,"That hasn't changed, has it? Then just tell them again."
16348,Any king who denies the Emperor will wake one morning to face the Legion staring down his gates.
16349,Come to gawk at the monster?
16350,That message is this.
16351,"I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful."
16354,The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded.
16355,"Once again, your suspension is lifted. Please try and control yourself."
16356,"Only thirty more and it'll be all yours. If I might ask, who is the lucky woman?"
16357,I do not know - but none have passed through.
16358,Go and tell Erik that I've changed my mind. I'll see about borrowing some money in Whiterun for his armor.
16360,"Don't applaud yourself too soon, worm!"
16362,I do.
16363,"Don't threaten me, boy. You're either a Nord who respects our traditions, or you're not."
16365,You appear ready for the Oath.
16367,Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?
16368,"We're a small village, but we work hard, and take care of our own."
16370,There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything. Just calm down.
16373,You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades.
16375,"It's quiet for now, Dragonborn. Perhaps later we'll find where one of those serpents is hiding."
16376,Do I trust him? Not in the slightest.
16377,"Only you can truly defeat these monsters, Dragonborn, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you."
16382,"I'd be honored, but I have work to do in the mines."
16388,"Die, you Orc filth!"
16389,Citizen?
16390,"Good luck, Dragonborn."
16391,"Let me know when you are, then."
16392,Alduin mahlaan
16394,Always a pleasure to meet a prospective bard.
16395,It feels like a whole mountain of rock is above  us.
16396,"When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power."
16399,You want a cut of venison or mutton? Of course you do.
16400,"Well, there's this boy, and..."
16402,And you'll be trampled to death!
16404,I never should have taken this job!
16406,And that you knew where to get more. Let's go find one!
16407,"Sorry, I'm not buying any goods until you straighten this out with Vex."
16410,I think I'm going to get another drink.
16413,Welcome to the cozy little family. I'm one of the lookouts for the Guild. I watch Delvin's back.
16414,"If you like mead so much, why not go live in Riften?"
16415,"These axes can chop a lot more than wood, you know."
16418,Opportunities for what?
16419,Make sure those forged documents get to the Legate in Morthal. They should give them the wrong idea... and us the advantage.
16420,"Give me a moment while I make a few, um, ""corrections"" to these reports... There we go."
16421,Wuld...
16423,"Sneaking is overrated, eh?"
16424,"Oh, what delight. Another charming customer..."
16425,"Good, good. These aren't the most glorious jobs, but they pay well."
16426,Be careful. The spirits can speak to the living if there's a strong connection.
16427,But I cannot celebrate his fall. Zu'u tiiraaz ahst ok mah. He was my brother once. This world will never be the same.
16428,"Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more freely."
16429,This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through her Steward's private quarters.
16432,"An investment? Very well, I don't see why not."
16434,Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.
16437,"He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch him."
16438,He's in the inn. Look around. I'm sure you'll find him.
16440,It is? Well that's different.
16442,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Pale.
16445,I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.
16446,"Though, believe it or not, there are rumors of a weapon that even Eldergleam herself would lift her roots for, more out of fear than respect."
16447,"Let me out of here, damn it! I'm not a criminal!"
16451,"I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts."
16452,The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.
16453,"When you make up your mind, come find me there and we'll talk about your future."
16456,"Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away."
16457,"Return when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever."
16460,"Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?"
16461,"What is there to know? It's in the temple, you bring it out. You bring it to me, I pay you. Now get moving."
16465,"No, haven't seen anyone."
16468,"Oh? Were you after her yourself? I won't stand in your way, my friend. You have my word."
16471,How do you stay cheery down in these blazes?
16475,I hope someday we'll get to know each other better.
16478,You hear all this talk about a war? I hope it never comes here.
16479,"As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher."
16481,"Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?"
16483,"I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine."
16485,I am proud to have a mate to share in my blessings.
16486,"I do, and if you count yourself among their numbers then you've blood on your hands as well."
16488,"Don't you ""dear"" me! I had a bowl of Vampire Dust on my worktable not an hour ago and after you swept in there it's gone!"
16490,"They sit up there in their tower, doing gods-know-what, and who watches over them?"
16491,Look around you. Winterhold is in this state because of those damned mages.
16493,"Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?"
16494,"Done. Now move along, before you get me in trouble."
16495,Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full.
16497,"Thanks for the offer, Jouane, but I'm saving up for a new sword."
16498,"Once we get inside, all will become clear."
16499,Wonderful! My lady Mara will be quite pleased!
16504,"With Ulfric dead and the Stormcloaks gone, who will have the courage to champion the cause of Talos?"
16505,This way... the library isn't far.
16508,Families torn apart?
16509,"Guess the Empire's going to need plenty of iron what with all the fighting. That'll be good for us, I suppose."
16512,I promise to answer all of your questions. Follow me.
16515,"What? You see a man fallen on hard times, and you think he's been like that forever?"
16516,"Wait, what?"
16518,"The Torpor should be in a tall bottle with dark liquid. If you find it, bring it to me."
16519,"Ah, you want protection? I can get you what you need."
16521,"This way, my daughter."
16522,Not against me. Against all of Falkreath. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us.
16523,My brother Anoriath and I came up with it one night after consuming... rather too much mead.
16524,"We ought dig a big hole, throw all them dark elves and Argonians in it, and let 'em tear each other to pieces."
16525,"One day, you'll be forced to make a choice. And I hope it's the right one, brother."
16526,Don't let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older. Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl.
16527, 
16529,"This way, my son."
16530, 
16533,"And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?"
16534,"Damn you, Mercer!"
16536,Agh! Bastard!
16542,"It's been... years I think, but perhaps you could still find him."
16543,"That would be good! I could use it to smash other rocks. Easier to mine, then."
16546,"Let me guess, they're saying it's because of this trouble with the Stormcloaks?"
16547,"Fine, go ahead."
16551,"I can't understand why Jorn would want to join the Imperial Legion. Soldiers only appreciate one thing, and it isn't music."
16554,"Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common."
16557,Look over there. That's a dwarven ruin.
16560,You want a drink?
16561,"The Star is free to purify itself. Don't worry, mortal. I will return you before you are cleansed."
16565,Somebody help!
16566,Hrmph. You're no fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun elsewhere.
16567,"Just cause some pain. I don't want a death on my conscience. If you get caught, it's not my problem."
16568,At least Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
16570,You never know what you'll find laying around in a crate or barrel. People toss the darnedest things in them.
16572,That's far enough.
16574,I'm well. How are things over at the stables? Old Hofgrir giving you a hard time?
16577,"You've come to the wrong city, then. Windhelm's a haven of prejudice and narrow thinking, unworthy of one such as you."
16579,Keep it. Not worth going to prison over.
16581,"My orders are to tell the riff-raff to use the North Gate, that's it."
16582,"Windhelm has been hard on my people. But our fortunes will turn, and we have shelter and food."
16584,Hold and stand down.
16585,"A good house. You chose well. I don't like sitting still, so I've decided to open a store. Buy and sell whatever is needed."
16590,We're the only Temple in Skyrim that can openly worship Talos.
16591,"Wise up, Harrald. There's a storm on the horizon and it will blow through here with all its fury. It's time to choose a side."
16597,"I couldn't let her run off to that pretender Eorlund Gray-Mane, could I?"
16602,"We don't have travelers from Elsweyr or Hammerfell anymore, Endon. Only the natives and the Nords stay in Markarth now."
16603,Yyyyyeeeaaaaahhhhhh!
16604,"You want in, you need to cooperate."
16605,"Good. Make it it happen, soldier."
16606,I've got a bad feeling about this.
16607,Have you decided to pay the visitor's tax?
16608,Now you're just making me mad.
16609,"In my time, the Blades protected the Emperor. It would seem these Penitus Oculatus will prove equally incompetent."
16611,You say you found it in Hjerim? Friga's old place. Let's go have a look around there.
16614,"Don't you see? It was me. I set you up, wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother... everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me."
16619,It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Let me open the gate and you can head into the city.
16621,"Come now brother, don't act all high and mighty. I know you could care less about the war one way or another."
16624,I call upon Oblivion realms. The home of those who are not our ancestors. Answer my plea!
16626,"You got no respect, strutting about with that weapon out, threatening everyone."
16627,"I've been setting up some open trading with Tonilia back at the Guild in Riften, and it's proven to be quite profitable."
16629,"Once you've made a bit of a name for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do."
16630,How much does it cost?
16632,"Oh, you may have pleased me, but you have surely pleased the Night Mother. And our mother, she will never forget."
16635,Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.
16637,I have met Daedra and Dwemer and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man.
16640,"If a man has time to complain, he has time to work."
16641,"Don't want in, huh? Fine. Have a good walk to the next city."
16642,"This here's Rorikstead. Quiet place. Good people, though. You can get a room and a mug at the Frostfruit Inn if you care to stay."
16646,Look how you sniffed out my little scheme at the North Gate. You knew it was a shakedown and you called him on it. That's what I'm talking about.
16648,"He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home."
16649,I think a donation of 500 gold on your part is necessary in order to put this behind us.
16651,You have a mighty voice!
16652,I've half a mind to grab a pickaxe and start digging. Never know what you might find.
16654,"Yes, if someone were to put out the Lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot."
16659,"He was told to run the scam on merchants, but he smelled the gold on you and his judgment went out the window."
16663,You kept your cool and you didn't kill him. That's the mark of a professional thief.
16664,"Be wary for traps. If you spy one, try to get an enemy to trigger it."
16665,Killing him was a bit... impulsive.
16666,"Ah, but you look tired. Come, share a bottle of Honningbrew Mead with me!"
16668,"Kyne! Blessed Warrior-Wife. Shor's widow, sacred to any true Nord hunter. She's the mother of men and beasts, and her veil is the storm."
16669,"Those sycophants in the Temple would call her Kynareth. Just a pale shadow of the truth, like all the Temple Divines."
16671,I grew up hearing songs about Eyldi the Bear! She wrestled a storm out of the sky!
16673,Dragonborn. What do you need?
16674,Keep firing!
16675,We're getting close now. Be careful. Their leader is a tricky one.
16678,"Master Cruel-Sea comes and works the fields sometimes. I don't think the Mistress likes it, but she won't come out here to catch him."
16679,Forget about Hroggar. He's always so tired lately. I need someone with a little fire in their blood.
16680,Yeah... Let's wait a little longer. Then...
16681,Yamarz has fallen. It is now up to you to return the giant's hammer to Atub.
16682,"We were doing well, plenty of coin, a huge mansion and I was even betrothed to a lovely young woman."
16688,"Get going, then."
16693,"Until next we meet, lass."
16694,"I already have the gold band, but all I need are three flawless amethysts to complete the setting."
16695,"Please, let's hurry to the Temple before the Forsworn find me again."
16697,"Until next we meet, lad."
16698,Come back and see me if you ever need pickpocket training.
16699,"Need any more pickpocket training, you just let me know."
16700,Come find me if you need more marksman training.
16701,"Falkreath will be returned to Imperial control, under the authority of Jarl Siddgeir."
16702,Ulfric. Stop.
16703,Sorli and I are just here to make sure the mine is run proper.
16704,"A good point, old friend. "
16706,"The fever's down a bit, an' I can almost see straight."
16708,"If you ever need more practice with the bow, just grab me."
16710,"It's called the Nightweaver's Band. I wore this for years. I want you to have it now. It'll give your magic and sneakiness some much needed ""oomph."""
16713,Maybe I'll see you around the Guild.
16715,I hope we bump into each other again.
16716,I'm sure we'll speak again.
16717,"Some other time, perhaps."
16719,"We're not going to make it, are we?"
16720,Sure I did. And I'd do it again.
16722,Go and pick some fights.
16726,You stop that! I will not be violated by some... half-Septim magician!
16728,"Off for some wine, eh? Drink one for me."
16729,Good luck on your next job.
16730,"Don't hurry back, I won't be waiting."
16731,Only way this guilds going to continue to grow is by takin' extra work.
16733,Ro fus... maybe you only balance the forces that work to quicken the end of this world.
16735,What a fascinating conversation that would be!
16736,"What's the matter, afraid of getting your hands dirty?"
16737,"And why not? I'm handsome, strong and smart. What else could you possibly need?"
16738,Dovahkiin.
16739,...the Miasma... They're still here! Stop them!
16740,"Hey, this guild needs the coin... walkin' away without takin' work is not going to make you popular around here."
16741,"If you're looking for potions, I think I can be of service."
16742,Don't give them a chance to warn the others!
16743,Can I give you a little tip? Take every job you can get or else you'll end up a beggar.
16745,How do you feel? I think you might be sick. 
16746,Very well.
16747,I remember you... You were with us at Helgen... I heard you came around and picked the right side. Welcome to the Legion!
16748,It can't be helped.
16750,Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.
16751,"It doesn't matter if they're in the city. We fight them where they live, we won't have to fight them here."
16753,Don't forget your represntin' the Guild. Don't do anythin' stupid.
16754,Don't muck this up.
16756,"That which is unknown can create unease, even fear. It is to be expected."
16757,I got another harangue from Torsten yesterday.
16758,Just remember the rules... keep it clean and keep it quiet. Here's the details.
16759,"Hey, where do you think you're going? We have work to do."
16760,"Come on, take another job so we can both make some money."
16762,Walking away without taking a job is like passing a bloated coinpurse on a table.
16763,"Hey, I still have plenty of work to do here."
16764,Don't give up now... there's plenty of loot out there just ripe for the taking.
16765,"Are you going to see him? Do tell him ""hello"" for me, won't you?"
16766,You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defense?
16768,I don't want a trail of dead bodies leading here. Keep it clean.
16770,"If you get arrested, it's on your head."
16771,No one dies. Remember that. We're not assassins.
16772,Show those thieves not to steal from Lucan Valerius!
16773,There is none who can stand in my way.
16774,"Running a little light in the pockets, lad?"
16775,"As to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay."
16778,Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things is to just let them sort themselves out.
16779,Winterhold. You want the College there. They teach quite a bit.
16780,Is anyone out there? Anyone?
16781,Good luck.
16782,Speak with Galmar. You'll be going on a little errand with him.
16783,"You blind, girl? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that."
16788,What are you waiting for? Up the stairs! Now!
16789,"Vex just tells me to run, so I did. Half of them went after me, the other half went after her."
16792,You are brave. Balaan hokoron. Your defeat brings me honor.
16793,Coward. You're nothing. Nothing!
16798,Me? I ran... and I ran... straight through the gates of Windhelm and all the way back to Riften.
16799,"Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef."
16801,"Are you kidding me? Vex lost them in seconds... once she steps into the shadows, she vanishes."
16802,So I found something. Here. Take it. I think you'll like it.
16803,Soon it will be time to replenish our supply of water.
16807,"I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather not be in debt to a stranger."
16808,Vex was waiting for me at the Flagon when I came in... drenched in sweat. Everyone just took a look at me and laughed.
16811,Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?
16812,Better not set anything on fire.
16814,"So, that's how I earned the name. Now keep it to yourself."
16815,The Dark Mistress? Sent you? Ha. Now tell me the one about the Troll who gives gifts to good little boys and girls.
16822,"Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first."
16823,"Hey there! Check out what my friend and I found. I'll sell some of it to you, if you want!"
16824,"Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving for Friga, too? No... they treated me like garbage, threw me away."
16825,"I'm just the cook, lass."
16826,"Because it was dull. Every day was the same boring routine; working at the winery, social visits with friends, parties with no one I cared about."
16827,"It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It deserves proper respect and study."
16830,"Made a lot of coin, but I didn't care. I didn't really need it... I was running with them because it fit, made me feel alive. "
16833,Offer yourself up as a sacrifice while you're there.
16835,"Rorikstead's a nice enough little hamlet, but a boring posting for a guard. If a dragon attacks, well... then it'll be a different story."
16837,Zah...Frul!
16838,"Ah, well, I recently approached Sibbi Black-Briar about buying Frost, one of the finest breeding horses in Skyrim. He agreed to sell."
16841,"And you know what? Despite what I left behind, I don't regret it one bit."
16842,"Yes, but I am honor-bound to stay here."
16843,I ended up in Skyrim thanks to a contact I'd made when I was with the Crescents... good old Delvin.
16845,Why do you care anyway? It's not like we're family. This is a business.
16847,"Look, I don't really know you. I don't even really know anyone here."
16851,You've got that fire under control. Right?
16854,"I just want to find a good husband, and start a family of my own."
16855,This seems like a really bad idea to me.
16856,Owning a farm does have its advantages.
16858,Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.
16861,"That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few."
16862,Making that trip to Darkwater Crossing was a huge help. Thank you.
16866,"Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen."
16867,"The Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will not allow them to control us."
16868,This is it! Hold at all costs! Don't give them any more ground!
16869,A shame. Perhaps another time then.
16870,"Oh, wait... it gets much better."
16871,My parents are being impossible.
16872,Don't think you'll get special treatment just because you have a house in the city...
16873,Farewell. Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
16874,Then the judgment of this Circle is complete.
16876,"Scary, thinking of those boots with an army of Elven weapons at their command. Let's be thankful they're half a world away, eh?"
16878,Would you mind helping me with the demonstration? Are you at all familiar with ward spells?
16879,Come to laugh at the grave tender?
16880,"My boy's to grow up without a mother? What life is that? It's not right, I tell you."
16881,A stranger comes to our hall.
16883,So that's my sad story. What do you think?
16884,I never returned to that pig farm you know. There's nothing for me there.
16888,"Maybe one day, just not today."
16890,The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing in exacting detail.
16891,We left to help with the war and these filth bags swooped in and seized the place.  My family is in there.
16892,"But no, you're content to snatch scraps falling off the Emperor's table. Fine. Take my home. Take my city. May it burn down around you."
16893,Fort Hraagstad is one of the few that remains mostly intact. 
16898,"What? Why? I don't understand... I have done nothing to wrong you. Please, mercy! "
16899,You haven't heard? All of Dawnstar hasn't had a decent night's rest in days.
16900,No. It's not. Trust me.
16901,I didn't mean to imply I was earning an honest living either.
16903,"Either way, the trick was in the escape, and that's where my strengths came in handy."
16904,"Well, I'm not sure how they've managed it, but they have. No leaders since Ysgramor. "
16908,"I'd do jobs for the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, but if things didn't go as planned, I was on my own."
16910,"We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone. For the age of oppression is now nearly done."
16911,He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can.
16912,After that I promised myself I'd never do it again.
16913,The last jailbreak I attempted failed. I was imprisoned in High Rock for three years before they let me go.
16917,Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't screw this up.
16920,"Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions."
16923,You heal away my scars and there's gonna be a problem...
16925,I saw this and thought of you. It would be a waste on anyone lesser. I hope you like it.
16926,"Now you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?"
16928,"All the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink and all the women I could bed."
16930,Don't get me wrong. The first few years with that clan were some of the best years of my life.
16936,Welcome to Solitude. Home of the arts here in Skyrim.
16937,Then... there is hope! The gods have not abandoned us! We must... we must...
16938,The prey is strong. Stronger than the hunters.
16939,"If you try to hurt me again, I may have to kill you."
16948,You have a problem wth that? Take it up with Madanach. I'm sure the King in Rags and his Forsworn would love to meet you.
16949,I'm too swift for you!
16950,"We tore each other to pieces. After it was over, those of us that remained simply went our separate ways."
16951,"Luckily, I had made some friends with the clan who immediately sided with me."
16953,"No, we usually let them go. I refused to do it, and Garthek ordered the clan to kill me as well."
16955,"You're right. You're right. Feller might be nutters, might not. But fact is, he needs help. I turn him away, what kind of man am I, hmm?"
16956,Never knew what became of the rest of the clan that survived. I suppose they moved on just like I did.
16958,"Quickly, if you please. I'm quite busy running errands for my bastard of a brother..."
16959,"All of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield great power, securely sealed within our minds."
16961,Where'd you come from?
16963,Remembers our lessons from the sword masters of Alcaire? Let me show you a few things you may have forgotten before we leave Hroldan.
16964,Yeah. Kind of scary too.
16966,Aren't they all?
16967,You go ahead and arrange the wedding ceremony when you're ready.
16968,I can take care of myself.
16971,"And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid."
16972,"It's not enough that you've stolen the spotlight with this Eye thing, now you're looking for the Augur?"
16974,No one does. I've even taken the damn thing to the College of Winterhold.
16975,That's better. Now we can talk.
16978,"But if not... if they actually mean something, they might tell me where I'm from... what ship was I on. Everything."
16979,Perhaps. They could be nonsense... inane scribbles done by someone in idle boredom.
16981,"Thanks, Aia. That means a lot."
16982,"..told him to just hand over the gold, but did he listen? Oh, no... they always have to fight back..."
16987,"Oh, don't worry about me. I relish the challenge."
16988,Ah! Here it is.
16990,I appreciate that.
16991,I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?
16992,Azura bless you.
16993,It's kind of an amusing tale.
16994,"And why would I... Oh. Oh! Guards! Guards, I need assistance!"
16996,"You keep your mouth shut, and I pay you. Handsomely."
16997,"Ahhh, I see. I think I know just what you need. I don't have anything like that here now, but my Eorlund - he can make you one right quick."
16999,"As for me, I kept from you only what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not ready to know, as your question reveals."
17000,"Together, we made short work of them and the last one limped away licking its wounds."
17001,"Well, there were eight of them and she'd already killed three by the time I joined the fight."
17002,"All right, let's see if we can find a way out."
17007,"Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion."
17010,"We scuffled for a while, broke each other's weapons, and finally fell to the ground exhausted."
17011,"Actually, that's when she politely asked me to hand over my coin purse. Can you imagine?"
17012,Sir.
17013,Raaarr!
17014,"After a few minutes, she looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I wanted to join the Guild. Just like that, no apologies."
17016,Indeed.
17019,"I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to cross blades with Vex again, but I certainly wouldn't mind a bit of a scuffle..."
17020,Something told me I wouldn't regret it. I had heard the Guild was back on its feet again and most of Skyrim under its belt.
17021,"Someday, a gallant hero will ride up and take me away. Someday..."
17023,I used to be a member of the Morang Tong.
17024,"If you can see your destiny clearly, your sight is clearer than mine."
17026,"Good. I'd prefer using water to cool my metal, but it's what the Jarl wants."
17028,Here. Take this. You'll need it. Use it on the island. Don't lose it. That's all the help you're getting.
17029,Where's my head? I never even greeted you properly.
17030,"The exact nature of my research is a secret, I'm afraid, but it really is quite valuable."
17034,"Oh, no you don't!"
17035,Only the foolish or the courageous approach a Jarl without summons...
17036,"Oh, thank you my chief!"
17037,"Where they operate within the shadows, we operated on the side of justice."
17038,"You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there..."
17039,My family has owned Karthwasten for generations. Rare for anyone in the Reach that isn't a Nord.
17043,"I don't haggle. If you want a lower price, look elsewhere."
17045,"I didn't have a choice. When the Red Mountain erupted in Morrowind, the Tong fled... spread to the nine winds."
17051,"Gee up, there."
17052,Feel free to return to me with questions. The Blue Palace is an open forum.
17053,"He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice, or Tongue."
17054,You're good as dead!
17055,You'll want some thick armor if you're traveling the Reach alone.
17056,"Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all."
17058,"They won't say much, but most people have very strong opinions about the College and those that study here."
17059,"I claim the glory of your defeat, Dovahkiin!"
17061,"You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and spectacular."
17062,I should hope so. The Dark Brotherhood is also known to place contracts on those who associate with the Morang Tong as well.
17063,"The beastblood has given me prowess, but my soul is now forfeit to Hircine upon my death."
17066,Many thanks.
17068,Welcome back. I've left a few surprises for you to discover.
17070,I knew this day would eventually come.
17073,"Boring? That food is paying for everything. If we lose even a single crop, we could starve or be forced to beg. I won't have it!"
17074,I get my skooma from Sarthis Idren. He has some sort of a setup over at the Riften Warehouse.
17075,"Death is but the time to sleep forever, in the Void."
17076,"Crimson Nirnroot? I'd heard such a strain existed, but never imagined I'd see any in my lifetime."
17079,Wrong!
17080,"Although... most of you are already in bed with her! But again... I speak figuratively, of course!"
17084,"Of course! It's where my mentor, Sinderion said he was going to do his field research."
17085,I'm Calcelmo's nephew. I help him around the laboratory.
17089,Let's get down there. We have to do something.
17094,Now what?
17095,"""The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered."""
17096,I won't go down so easily!
17098,You've gathered quite a few of them I see.
17099,"Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary in there!"
17102,What?
17103,"I actually advise the Jarl on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head."
17107,You heard him. Go on in.
17109,The Pale will throw those Imperial backbiters up against the wall when they come for us.
17111,"As the saying goes, you do not need to be faster than the dragon; you need only be faster than your friends."
17112,"Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future."
17113,One of those things has the key to this cage. If you get me out of here I'll help you slaughter the rest of those crows.
17114,You want to get paid? Do what I hired you for.
17115,Thank you.
17116,"You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old? "
17118,"Ah, yes. Solitude. Seat of the High King of Skyrim. Messy business, kingslaying. Ah, but so very satisfying..."
17119,"One day, these beautiful plants will make us famous and we can finally move off of this farm... thanks to Sinderion."
17121,"Does she? Listen, sister... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid."
17123,"If you're looking to join up, Kodlak's the one to be talking to."
17125,Perhaps someday I'll reopen a shop here in Skyrim.
17126,"If you need any help with Destruction spells, please let me know."
17127,I just...
17128,"Hey, what the...?"
17129,"Yes, I suppose someone has to be around here. Have you seen the condition of this sorry excuse for a city?"
17130,Buying and selling fine jewelry here!
17132,"Now that our ""ghost"" has been unmasked, I hope we see more visitors in town than just the occasional pilgrim."
17133,"This will take time to decryptify. Be on your way, and Septimus will find  you if he has further need."
17134,"In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout."
17138,Yes. He was an absolute genius when it came to the nirnroot.
17139,My husband Leigelf is dead. I... I never thought I would miss that oaf so much.
17142,"As for work, you could try to catch Skald in a good mood, but your best bet would be working in the mines. They're on opposite ends of town."
17143,Did you hear that? Pavo was driven out of his mine. Almost everyone is dead.
17144,He was a strange Altmer... paid more attention to his research than his own well-being. He lived in the basement of an inn for goodness sakes!
17151,"I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh?"
17152,You have all helped make this a truly extraordinary wedding. All of my dreams have come true. So thank you. Thank you all.
17155,You've done alchemy a great service by helping to complete Sinderion's work.
17159,This is how it's done.
17160,"Gems, potions, exotic ingredients... I have them all!"
17162,You'll need a little more coin than what you're floatin' around with.
17163,"Well, perhaps it's time for some independent study."
17165,"Ah, I think that'll do just the trick."
17166,The Dread Lord awaits!
17167,He's so afraid to talk to me he's sending you to do it? I should've expected as much.
17169,"Ah, you're back. Ready to try again, are we? Let's start from the top. You were sent to kill the Gourmet. And he is..."
17172,"Oh, a brutish one. Septimus has no fear of you. But as one block raises another, perhaps ourselves could help us each."
17174,It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its pedestal.
17176,It should put on some coverings.
17178,You there.
17180,Untold numbers of Nords died defending the Empire against the Dominion. And for what?
17182,Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons. Dean Six Fingers used to say I was quite good with the flute.
17183,"If I'd been on guard at the Thalmor Embassy, wouldn't nobody be disturbing that party... "
17194,"That is all I will say, for it grieves me to speak of it."
17195,"A navy, my lord. We could stop the influx of Imperial troops to Solitude, and choke their northern lines."
17197,"You're a little light on coin there, my friend. No gold, no refit."
17200,Agh! Pathetic mortal!
17201,"Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more."
17202,"The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm."
17206,"Give it, quickly."
17208,"Yes, Sir. Although I'm not sure you'll be happy to know."
17209,Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.
17210,Don't say something you'll regret.
17211,I wouldn't even clean my tail with this trash.
17212,"The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key."
17214,And just what's that supposed to mean?
17215,"A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them."
17217,"Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it."
17218,The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals.
17220,"I'm sending you to Serpentstone Island. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway."
17221,Extraordinary. I see it now.
17222,You could have warned me you were baiting me into a trap.
17225,You reek. A little friendly advice - take a bath and get some new clothes.
17226,And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why he left you.
17227,We should get a dragon for the Pit. I'd love to fight one.
17228,And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger.
17229,You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.
17230,I have a long way to go before I'm ready for the kind of advanced magic I've been attempting.
17232,Some day I'm going to forge my own sword!
17233,"Yeah, take care of yourself."
17236,"Time is of the essence here, please hurry back."
17238,"Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for me."
17239,"I can't go any further, Shield-Sister."
17240,"I can't go any further, Shield-Brother."
17242,None. Not back to him.
17243,"The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak."
17244,"I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said. Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your observations and move on."
17247,"Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer."
17248,"We'll need trained, disciplined and creative warriors ready for all that."
17249,"I'm sorry, but that's as far as my generosity extends."
17250,The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more.
17252,"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Sister here."
17254,Very well. Keep at it. You may go.
17257,"Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be."
17258,Thank Her Benevolence it wasn't burned like the other tomes.
17260,Kodlak did not care for vengeance.
17261,Lady Mara bids you welcome to Her Benevolence.
17265,Don't worry about it. Keep it.
17266,"We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years."
17267,"Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the answers."
17268,Get me out of here!
17271,"You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it."
17272,And you avenged him.
17273,"While you're doing that, I'll work on getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party."
17275,Is that? Did you repair the blade? 
17277,"Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby."
17279,"Aia, please be quiet. Viarmo and I are discussing matters of national politics."
17280,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
17281,"We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood."
17282,"My nephew, the Emperor. Too busy to attend the wedding of his beloved cousin. We won't stand for this slight, I assure you."
17283,"I'm sorry, what?"
17284,That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean.
17287,This isn't a good time.
17288,"If these ruins frighten you, take comfort in the knowledge that I am here."
17291,"I've seen bigger houses, but it's yours, so I like it. Now, I think I need something to do if you're ever away, so I'll be opening a store."
17292,Thank you. I'll be here.
17293,Good for him. For the both of them.
17295,"The corn stores are getting low again, Orgnar."
17297,I'll give you one good reason. Maven Black-Briar.
17298,"I've been looking to expand the business, and your investment will certainly help with that. I accept!"
17299,"My servants serve their own purposes. But, if their will is insufficient, nor suitably aligned with mine, I simply destroy them. "
17300,I'm collecting ingredients to bring to the Gourmet. He'll think my tastes so refined when I offer them to him.
17303,The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.
17304,"Her mother would have had the key, but she... that family is cursed, I tell you."
17307,To think that we would sit down with that... Thalmor bitch. I say she walks or we walk.
17308,Fortune to you and your children.
17309,"That may be true, but I ordered Irileth to bring back proof. You'd best report back to her at once."
17312,Darkwater Crossing is a difficult journey. Mind yourself.
17318,"In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford."
17319,And Meieran thinks that we should go there.
17320,Lisbet handles the customers. I just check the shipments.
17322,Blessings of the Nine Divines upon you. How may I help?
17323,"If either group goes through less official channels and attempt to contact you directly, please refer them to the College's Master Wizard."
17326,Because you are such a very nice Orc?
17329,"I might be a woman, but I can crack rock with the best of them."
17334,"I'm glad you were able to negotiate a truce, but I don't trust Ulfric. He'll break his word as soon as it suits him."
17335,"The Keeper will be arriving soon, with the body of the Night Mother. So many preparations to be made..."
17336,"Yes sir, Professor Gemane! It's a war epic about Hoag Merkiller's last stand!"
17341,"Oh, not so confident now, are we? "
17344,I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?
17347,Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously.
17349,"Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say."
17351,"Nocturnal, guide my hand!"
17356,"I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for."
17361,"""Next season for sure..."" What? Uncle Calcelmo, I don't understand what you mean."
17362,Name it.
17363,You've brought us quite the meal.
17364,Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet. 
17365,They got archers up along the wall!
17366,This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while.
17368,Let me know if you need a drink. That's what we're here for.
17371,All that ever mattered was what was best for Morthal. Leaving it in Ulfric's hands... It's not right.
17372,"You're lucky I respect the Greybeards' council, Galmar!"
17373,It's our wedding day. I feel like all of Skyrim is focused on just the two of us.
17375,"The objects you see here might look mundane at first glance, but I assure you, behind each is an unusual tale."
17382,"Well, she's dead. But I guess that's not unusual, at least not for somebody in here."
17383,"Damn it. I gave it away, didn't I?"
17386,"Master Borri will teach you ""Nah"" - ""Fury"" - the second word of Whirlwind Sprint."
17389,"Jorgen and I both work hard, all the time. Morthal is important to both of us."
17390,"Yes, thank you Arch-Mage."
17391,I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble.
17396,Then you know what a beauty she is.
17399,"Mining out this old rock is a lot quieter, now. Thank the Divines."
17400,You might consider putting on... something. Anything.
17402,I can't explain the details. That would be giving away many secrets the Synod have learned over the years.
17403,"Looks like the damned rebels got here first. No matter, we have the element of surprise. Prepare to move out."
17404,Gotta have a sharp axe to cut through all that fat...
17407,That's absurd. Come on now.
17409,Madanach! Think you can escape my prison do you? You'll pay for what you've done to my family!
17411,One day we were cracking rocks in the deepest parts of the mine and the next day they were all over the place.
17412,Doing nothing will not grant our tribe relief from this curse. We must try.
17417,"I used to look forward to the day when I was of age, to see new places and people, but now it feels like a cage."
17418,"While you're in there, help yourself to anything in Frey's manor. I would."
17420,"No one's been hurt yet, and they seem to be staying in the mine, but who knows how long that will last?"
17421,Moved right in and made themselves at home. Did it overnight. I'm not even sure exactly where they came from.
17422,"Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up."
17423,Fine. Just keep it clean. Here you go.
17426,"Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice."
17427,Let's tread softly.
17431,"My first and only loyalties are to my nephew, and to this city."
17432,"Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody."
17435,"I think you'll be a superb addition to the College. Welcome, Apprentice."
17436,"Nobody else has come up the south road today, as far as I know."
17437,Goodbye then.
17441,"This is a jail, owned by the Silver-Blood family. We use the prisoners to mine for ore."
17444,Tsk. You've uncovered my master plan. Now I suppose you'll never leave.
17445,"Zu'u lost ofan hin laan... now that I have answered your question, you will allow me to go free?"
17446,"With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old."
17449,What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's coffin! Explain yourself!
17450,Absolutely.
17452,"It's a shame our daughter couldn't make the journey herself, but at least she still thinks of us."
17454,This brings back memories. Come back when you're done and maybe I'll be up to showing you a few tricks.
17457,Just saying goodbye.
17459,"Watch yourself on High Hrothgar, I hear wolves prowl the steps."
17461,"If you want to make new armor or weapons, use the forge. It takes plenty of raw materials though, such as iron or steel."
17462,"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand."
17464,"I was pretty bad off for a while, but a priest of Mara was passing through on his way to Dawnstar and healed me to the best of his abilities."
17465,I had a bad fall in the mine when I was bringing some food to the men.
17466,"You going to buy something or just here for training? Otherwise, move on."
17468,A citizen of the Reach has asked for our help.
17469,I doubt the Empire has the stomach for much more bloodletting.
17472,"Oh, if you insist!"
17473,"So you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little Family. I've heard quite a bit about you."
17478,"Unless it's gold for another round of drinks, I don't wanna hear it."
17479,Return when the elf lies dead and it will be yours.
17482,I feel the eyes of angry spirits upon us. We are not welcome here.
17483,"Yes, Listener. I won't move unless you give the word."
17485,"Maybe it is. Look, I want to go back but I won't feel right in there without a tie to Talos."
17489,You were right Galmar.
17492,"Vignar the Revered is the Jarl in Whiterun. I guess he was a great hero once, because the Companions all call him ""Vignar the Revered."""
17493,Let me take a look...
17495,"I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric..."
17497,"Well... By rights, she had a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim."
17498,I couldn't. It would shame my chief and my mother and foremothers.
17499,How long can we keep this up?
17501,Let the Forsworn ravage the Reach. Talos favors us. Our victory is assured.
17502,They want this as much as you do. Perhaps they want it more.
17503,I live... again.
17504,I make sure Erikur keeps breathing.
17506,"But you are that man, Ulfric.  You've been that man before, and you'll be him again. "
17507,Thongvor. I should have executed your whole treacherous clan when I had the chance.
17508,"I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe."
17509,I can tell you're no stranger to the wilds. I'm sure we can meet your hunting needs.
17510,"I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense."
17514,"Gods, it's cold. They'd better find something good in there to make this worthwhile."
17515,You're certain we're ready?
17516,"And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls down with my bare feet! - if you would only ask me to do it!"
17517,"They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the rebels behind them!"
17518,"As soon as you left I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here."
17519,"No problem, but if you get too far away, we're going to catch up."
17521,"And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!"
17523,This is it.
17524,Here. A little something for you.
17525,Alright.
17526,"And I'm sure you could do it, too. "
17527,Congratulations on getting the festival restored.
17529,Yes!
17532,"Send the word. ""A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun."""
17534,"The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him."
17535,You know the rules.
17537,Try to hide it all you want. I know you're in the Thieves Guild... and so do the other guards.
17538,I am... surprised that Gularzob was named chief.
17539,Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the front lines. 
17540,"Then you finally know what it means to be a true hunter, in the Nord way."
17542,"Do you know why I live here, at the peak of the Monahven - what you name Throat of the World?"
17544,Let's hope it's as powerful as the Psijics believe it to be.
17545,"The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor."
17548,Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in. 
17549,"Well then, if you don't want the extra gold, you can certainly let Letrush keep it as a gesture of goodwill."
17551,"You think all the council my father provides the Jarl is his alone? Hmph. Let's just say I advise the advisor, and leave it at that."
17552, 
17554,Hey! Watch what you're doing.
17555,"Please, just let me handle it. It's not a problem."
17556,"Good. Now remember - pain, and lots of it. But not to the death. If they arrest you, it's not my problem."
17558,"With you by my side, is that right Horik?"
17559,What are you doing talking to me? Didn't you know Brynjolf's been trying to find you? It's time to install you as Guild Master!
17560,I'll raise a cup to your grave!
17561,"Brynjolf tells me you'll make an excellent Guild Master. Oh, he's looking for you, by the way."
17562,Brynjolf's been looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
17563,"So, they're making you Guild Master, eh? Good. Just find Brynjolf and he can make it official."
17564,Looks slow to me.
17565,"Bye, mister."
17566,"There is no one else, but very well. I cannot force you to accept your destiny."
17567,I heard Brynjolf is looking for you. I think it's time for the Guild to have a new leader.
17568,"I think it's time we make this Guild Master thing official. Go and talk to Brynjolf, he's makin' preparations."
17569,The East Empire Company is in your debt.
17570,"Don't worry, I promise this will be short and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room, we can begin."
17573,"Not now, you idiot. We'll talk after this ridiculous ceremony."
17574,There's yet hope that our relationship with the College can be repaired.
17575,"Gods, what a mess."
17576,I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.
17579,"A very long time ago, the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer."
17581,"I'm commander of the guard, now."
17582,"Good, that must be very comfortable for you. I think mine's a bit too small. Perhaps we could trade?"
17583,"After Brynjolf has installed you as Guild Master, we can speak at length."
17585,"Just because you've been accepted here so quickly, don't think I'm going to help you rise any faster."
17586,"I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine."
17589,It's... nothing...
17591,We can speak after the ceremony's done.
17592,"Congratulations, boss!"
17593,She's probably the one you ought to talk to.
17594,Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done. He needs to pay for Gallus's murder.
17595,I'm sorry! This isn't what I want!
17596,My brother's a good-for-nothing drunk. We'd have lost the house by now if it were up to him.
17597,Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.
17599,Shouldn't the ceremony be completed first?
17600,I promise to live up to your expectations.
17603,"Shor's bones, where will these demands end?"
17605,If you want my opinion I say it's just plain old bad luck.
17609,We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!
17611,"Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control. "
17612,I am at your service.
17614,Feel the thunder of my voice!
17615,The power of Mzinchaleft is mine! Begone from here!
17616,We can talk after the Guild Master ceremony.
17619,"So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!"
17622, 
17623,You've heard too? They say the town was completely destroyed by a dragon.
17625,Please excuse the mess.
17626,"I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer, anyway."
17627,"Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my hatching."
17628,"Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique."
17629,"With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours."
17631,"Tell me, why have you slain this one, who trusted you, here upon my shrine?"
17632,"Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order."
17633,"Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short."
17634,"We need coin, Ranmir, and you're not bringing home any."
17635,Agreed.
17637,Good. Then there isn't much more to say.
17640,Vex?
17641,Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery. 
17642,"Sure, why not."
17643,Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For shame!
17644,Karliah?
17645,"If you wouldn't mind bringing this back to her for us, I'd appreciate it."
17646,"Tell me, mother, does Malacath favor our stronghold?"
17647,"I'm kept so busy, I don't get to see my daughter as often as I'd like. Perhaps you've met her? Adrianne? She owns the shop, Warmaiden's."
17648,Looks like that's it. Got to go.
17652,"Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life."
17656,"If we were still living at my alchemy shop in Vivec City, it wouldn't be so bad, she could wander the canals all day."
17657,"Normally, a period of servitude."
17658,"Malacath is pleased with your strength, Larak."
17663,Don't let the shop's name frighten you away. I have plenty of reliable tonics and healing potions to sell.
17665,"I don't need luck, I need rest."
17666,"Fantastic. I was concerned I had asked for too many, but I'm glad to see you proved me wrong."
17668,Hroggar claims it was a hearth fire. Some folks say Hroggar started it himself.
17670,It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.
17671,"As long as the rebels are willing to die fighting the Empire, we must be willing to oblige them."
17674,Let me at least give you something for your efforts... finding all of these couldn't have been easy... or cheap.
17676,"No matter, I appreciate your generosity."
17677,"My goodness, how did you ever come by all of these?"
17681,Back to work.
17682,"Good luck finding those jazbay grapes, they're very rare."
17683,Changed your mind? Ready to find out the truth about Markarth?
17684,"This is your last warning. Get out, or get arrested."
17685,Come visit again sometime.
17688,"If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can."
17690,"A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had."
17695,"I assure you, it is. The knowledge contained in the Lexicon created everything you see around you."
17696,I suspected as much. The real question now is do we do something about it ourselves or do we speak to the Jarl?
17699,That's it! You found it!
17702,"Well, what news? Is Alain..."
17703,It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me.
17704,"Nothing, you pig-headed oaf!"
17705,Do you think we'll find gold nuggets in here?
17706,"I'm relieved to hear you say that. If you were to leave, I'd miss you terribly."
17711,I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind.
17712,"No, not gone... he's become one with the shadows."
17713,"You're trying to frighten me, hmm? Do your worst!"
17717,Oh... lovely. Now all my dear Pelagius has to worry about are the several hundred legitimate threats...
17718,Thanks. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.
17720,"...""go to the college"" da said... ""use your smarts"" he said... like I'm supposed to figure out which college he meant..."
17723,Fine. I'll wait until someone else with a little more courage comes along.
17724,I'll make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've made Skyrim a better place.
17725,I don't even know what to think anymore...
17729,"Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Brother to the Orcs."
17731,"What is it, Imperial?"
17733,Help Irileth kill this dragon before it can attack Whiterun. There's no time to lose.
17734,Excellent work. You have a true fighting spirit. Did that better than I could have.
17735,Watch yourself out there or they'll take everything away from you.
17736,"The Ratway is somewhere under Riften, shouldn't be too tough to find."
17738,"Dragons, thieves and war. I should have stayed in Morrowind."
17739,"Not only did I they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people."
17740,We make easy pickings for thieves looking to steal everything we worked so hard for.
17741,I guess that means you're finished. Here's your payment.
17742,"It was my home. But I left. The woods felt more alive, at least for a time."
17747,"Finally, someone with backbone. Here you go."
17750,Good fighting to you.
17751,"I have no strong love for the Stormcloaks but I can't say I'm all that fond of the Empire, either."
17753,"Something about using frost magic to chill the mead for a certain period of time. I felt it was a waste, but the Arch-Mage let them proceed."
17754,But I was going through his things and found a book I had never seen before. All about the Totems.
17755,Hrraaggh!
17756,"She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Aren may be in charge, but Mirabelle runs the place."
17757,At this very moment? No. However...
17759,Uh oh! Look out!
17761,"Sorry, but I have a treasure to get to..."
17762,We know that Shalidor had an understanding of magic that surpassed almost any of either his age or ours.
17763,He said he was going east towards the border of Morrowind to trade some of our grain to some folks at Broken Helm Hollow.
17766, 
17770,"What's done is done. Here, I want you to have this. Bringing me closure was kind of you."
17774,"It's Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften."
17775,It is good to finally know that Malacath has not forsaken us.
17779,Doesn't matter. I'm sure he's long gone by now anyway.
17781,"You dropped it by mistake? Well, if I was you, I'd go grab it now before somebody does."
17782,"Well, he said that a few men have been going by to some of the local farms promising a good price from all the local mills and farms."
17784,"Very well, then. If you'll just... get going now..."
17785,Don't be long. I can't wait around forever.
17786,"Absolutely not! I protest... uh, that is, yes, of course. I still don't understand what just... oh never mind."
17787,Reckon you can. How much you willing to pay?
17788,"Good, good. Keep up the hard work. It'll all pay off."
17789,This drink's on me.
17791,"But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and did some kind of dark ritual. He summoned killers to murder old Grelod. He's saved us all."
17792,Not at all. I consider it a blessing.
17793,"Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my heart. I'll see you soon."
17795,"Now... if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?"
17797,"Certainly, my good man. Here."
17799,You up for another wager?
17801,You were seen coming in. The girl at the door is a Forsworn agent masquerading as a maid.
17802,Drop by and see us again if you're ever in the area.
17803,Riff-raff! That's all you Riften people are! 
17804,"Bye, lady."
17805,As you wish.
17806,"Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?"
17807,"So, they're making you leader, huh? Better go find Brynjolf so he can seal the deal."
17808,Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me. 
17809,"Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid."
17812,"We believe the your efforts should be directed towards dealing with the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be."
17816,You must speak with the Farmhand at Chillfurrow farm.
17817,Exactly.
17818,"With just myself and one child, it's damn near impossible."
17820,I've got to get out of here!
17822,"Well, maybe that's not entirely true, but our clan's got a long an' proud history in this hold."
17823,We've got an old saying -- the Gray-Manes have lived in Whiterun since the first snows fell in Skyrim. 
17827,"Olfrid Battle-Born made his money from farming, an' got himself some new friends among the Empire's nobles."
17828,"Aye, they're an old clan like ours, but they cast their lot with the Empire when the uprising began."
17831,"When the troubles began, he took the Empire's side. We haven't spoken much since then."
17832,It was like he was daring us to come and get him.
17834,"You're mine now, Logrolf."
17836,"Nasty little buggers, aren't they?"
17837,Hurt anyone with that spell and you'll be sorry.
17838,"Kynareth has placed the Voice of wisdom within you, Dragonborn. All you need do is learn to listen to it, and your path will be clear."
17839,I'm running low on Petty Soul Gems.
17840,"We were two of the city's oldest an' most-respected clans, an' we could trace our histories all the way back to Ysgramor's companions."
17841,"Aye, we used to be fast friends, though it was long ago."
17842,"Well, I'll take it under advisement. Thank you."
17847,"Once things settle down, I'll be lookin' to recruit more guards for the city, then shore up our stores of food an' water."
17850,Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs! 
17851,"I guess they think I can open Ulfric's eyes to their plight, and get him to lift a finger on their behalf."
17853,Your man Horik is wearing his old Legion armor. What should I make of that?
17855,My knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a priest of Vaermina.
17858,"Much obliged. Here. It's not much, but take it anyway."
17859,Alduin always was pahlok - arrogant in his power. Uznahgar paar. He took domination as his birthright.
17860,I just think pollinating would be easier if I could do a lot of plants at once.
17863,It was Talos that helped us win back the city. I'm as sure of that as the sun rising in the morning.
17864,Have anything for us yet?
17865,You a fighting girl? How about a little bet?
17866,Do you?
17867,I trust you know what you're doing with that spell?
17872,"Tamriel is full of wisdom and magic, if one is willing to look for it. Few have their eyes open."
17873,I don't know. I never expected the old bag to follow me so far. Just get rid of him.
17876,"Pardon me, but I trust you've been working on your poem, on the classical heroes of Skyrim, yes?"
17877,"Oh, we have unfinished business you and I."
17878,"Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain."
17879,"Haven't you talked to Astrid? She's by the pool, greeting the Night Mother and her little jester. She has a contract for you. Come see me afterward."
17883,"It's like... he wants to talk. Likes people and all. But he stays separate, because he's supposed to."
17884,"What? I never even cast... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the Higher Art."
17885,They're able to grind it down so fine that it can be infused into the lattice of packed snow.
17887,They're almost... real. They say a priest of Mara has arrived in town. We'll see if faith can cure this curse.
17888,"Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of Power -- Shouts."
17889,Wait for me.
17892,"I would stand at her back, that the world might never overtake us."
17893,Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.
17895,"Ah, that's too bad."
17896,I think it may have to be far away from here.
17897,Now what am I supposed to do? I can't be seen in public like this. If I can even be seen at all...
17898,"If not, it isn't me you'll have to answer to, but the people of this city and this hold."
17901,"Ah, my dearest Urag! How are you today, my green-skinned friend?"
17906,"Someone's been pilfering crops from my farm. If I find out it's one of your kin, I'll see the culprit rot in prison."
17907,We're here to teach you a lesson.
17908,I... I'm sorry.
17909,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
17910,"Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy."
17911,"Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with him."
17913,I've already put in a claim to the land and property you'll forfeit when you're found to be a collaborator.
17914,You won't be laughing when the Thalmor come to root out Stormcloak sympathizers.
17917,Why don't you stay dead?
17920,"If you don't trust me, you were a fool to walk in here in the first place."
17921,Reeaaaallllyyyy?
17923,He's a half-decent farmer. Ask him to teach you to farm!
17924,"What? Speak your meaning plainly, old man."
17925,"Most days, I do all I can to stay away from my sister and my father. The beating's the same from either one."
17927,I'm one of General Tullius's agents. I was sent to investigate the Treasury House and the Silver-Blood family.
17929,"Don't lecture me about treachery, whelp. You don't know the meaning of the word."
17931,"But yes, it's been a lot of work. Vignar doesn't want the change to disrupt the lives of his people. They've got enough to deal with already."
17932,"Well, it could be worse. The former steward, Proventus, kept very detailed records."
17936,I've never been more ready!
17938,Maybe. That stuff's gettin' tough to bring across the border with all the Argonian patrols.
17939,"Good work. I'll send some men with a wagon to collect the prize. We can use the weapons here, and I'll pass on the coin to Solitude."
17940,Oh?
17941,"Life in Morthal has been troubled lately. The people are uncertain, restless. They merely look to the Jarl for leadership."
17942,"But remember, Whiterun is home to the Companions. Any dragon that comes here will get more than he's bargained for, I think."
17947,He's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in his hold.
17948,It's all in the swing. Let me show you.
17950,"Oh, did you miss the ceremony? It was rather quick, actually. The couple seemed more concerned with their reception."
17952,Use Clear Skies to open the way to Paarthurnax.
17953,It's all in the swing. Let me show you.
17954,"""When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped"""
17957,"I was going to give this to whomever killed her for me, but I suppose you've earned it by bringing me this information."
17958,"Great, with the two of us this should be easy."
17959,You were at Helgen when it was attacked? You saw this with your own eyes?
17960,"Well, you've come to the right place."
17963,"Well, you've come to the right place."
17964,"You must be starving. Here, spend it well."
17966,Darkness destroy you!
17967,"Listen, you should go to Solitude and join up with the Imperial Legion. We could really use someone like you."
17968,"Well, you've come to the right place."
17970,"Yes, the World-Eater is gone... may the spirits have mercy on our souls."
17971,They'll never see you coming.
17974,Master Borri will teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
17975,"Then lead on, friend."
17977,There's plenty of gold out there for the taking... if you're up to the challenge.
17979,Do you need something?
17980,"Oh, no no no... This is so wrong... "
17981,He's my cousin. Just give him another chance. Please.
17982,"Come, Dragonborn. Attend to Master Borri."
17988,Karliah's been through here. What does she expect to find?
17989,"Can you pay attention to work for once, instead of your mug?"
17990,"Things are looking up around here, lass."
17992,I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
17994,It's better that way.
17995,"Does it matter? You're warm, dry... and still very much alive. That's more than can be said for old Grelod. Hmm?"
17996,Unnff...
17998,I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
18006,"Now, there's no need to do anything rash..."
18011,It's good to spend some time on solid land.
18013,"Pull up a chair, my friend... this is quite a tale."
18014,The Thalmor saved all of Elven-kind during the Oblivion Crisis. We've been watching over our lands for 200 years.
18018,"You'll never compare to me, but I can try and teach you anyway."
18020,A woman like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
18021,I'll show you what I know.
18023,I'll show you what I know.
18024,But those who have sent you have not told you what they seek. What you seek.
18028,I'll show you what I know.
18029,Not for all the gold in Skyrim would I spend my life working in these tunnels.
18030,Unh!
18032,"All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me."
18034,"All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me."
18035,"Ha! Clearly, we should have killed that old bastard years ago!"
18036,"I've heard him boasting at the Bannered Mare, saying he'll ""conquer me as a true Nord conquers any harsh beast."" Hmph."
18037,"You'll be able to run circles around the big, slow brutes in Heavy Armor."
18039,"I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet."
18040,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
18044,My thanks to you.
18047,"Precisely. There are a few who still call Nocturnal ""Lady Luck"" and for good reason."
18050,The Hag's Cure is here for all your discreet needs...
18052,Don't miss out... purchase a bottle of my genuine Falmerblood Elixir! Only 20 septims each!
18053,"It'll take time to rebuild, but the Nords are no strangers to hard work."
18054,"Oh, most certainly. At least, when Elisif herself asks."
18055,"What is it, Argonian?"
18058,"We believe she may be hiding in Whiterun, but we're checking everywhere to be sure."
18059,"Without the coin to pack up and leave, I decided to take to trading."
18061,So if you don't have any business. Leave.
18063,I shall explain to you the mysteries of the outer realms.
18067,"I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall."
18068,"Use it right, and you won't feel a thing."
18071,I'll show you what I can about protecting yourself.
18078,You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.
18079,Walk into the the wrong place with your weapon drawn? You might not walk out again....
18084,You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.
18085,Worship of Talos is strictly forbidden.
18086,"Agh! Bother and befuddle! Stuck here! Stuck! My mother, my poor mother. Unmoving. At rest, but too still!"
18090,Get her!
18092,Execute every last bandit. Spare no one.
18093,Don't sound so disappointed. You wouldn't be allowed to take it even if there was.
18094,Thank you. Here. You honored my mother's task and should be rewarded.
18098,Whoa... Not even I'm that drunk...
18099,"And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak's gotten wind of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you. "
18101,Go! We'll follow when we can!
18104,That's it! Wonderful! I knew I could count on you.
18105,"Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear."
18108,I know all the good spots! You don't stand a chance!
18110,We'll meet back up at the Sanctuary! I'll be fine. Go!
18111,"Damn, where'd you go?"
18113,Stop your whining.
18118,I can. It might save your life.
18119,Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
18120, 
18122,"What is it, Drifa? What's the matter?"
18124,The soil beneath our feet is steeped in the blood of our ancestors. We've fought for this land and... died for it.
18126,"Very well, I'll try milady."
18127,What are you looking at? Scared of strong women?
18129,By whom?
18131,Think I'm defenseless? Well you're wrong!
18133,"Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?"
18135,I think I can teach you a thing or two.
18137,"When he shows up here and vouches for you, then I'll see what I can do for you."
18139,It's as rewarding as it is dangerous. Let's see what I can show you.
18140,"Put the thought out of your mind, and do not speak of it again."
18141,"Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors."
18144,"I asked what you thought of the Orcs, not about me."
18146,"It's not far. We used to go to the market there every month or so, until the roads got so dangerous with the war and all."
18147,Ulfric Stormcloak. Jarl of Windhelm.
18150,"Yes, ma'am."
18152,"Oh no, not at all."
18155,"For all I know, he's already forgotten the conversation. I wouldn't get your hopes up."
18156,Very well. She seems like a fighter to me. I'll give her the oath.
18157,Those Dark Elf refugees will take over the city if we aren't careful.
18159,"A change has swept into Solitude, like a breeze off the ocean - the Thieves Guild has come..."
18160,Very well. He seems like a fighter to me. I'll give him the oath.
18161,Very well. I'll do the oath later. Let's just get 'em geared up and ready to fight.
18162,"Goodbye. And if you happen to see Mikael, tell him I was asking about him..."
18163,"So I'll sell whatever I can. If it's worth putting a price on, you can bet I'll do it."
18165,Fall before the will of Sithis!
18166,That's the way it is.
18169,That's enough recruits for now. Ask Esbern about the dragon lairs he's been studying. We'll have the recruits do some hunting with you.
18170,"Not scared of an old woman now, are you?"
18174,"If I were you, I'd keep my feet dry and stay up here."
18175,You've already taken care of it?  Thank you friend.
18176,"Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take."
18181,You can easily break a blade on the metal skin of a Dwemer construct.
18185,"I am Tsun, shield-thane to Shor."
18187,"Thank you so much, this scroll means a lot to my family. Take this for your trouble."
18189,Then it's decided.
18190,"I'm sorry, I've come too far to lose it now."
18192,Insolent bard. Die!
18193,What's she doing poking her nose in there?
18194,I don't have time for anyone too lazy or cowardly to make their own way in this world.
18196,"No funerals, just some pain. If you get caught, it's not my problem."
18197,"Just get out of my way, I've got work to do."
18198,Do not fight it. Azura's prophecies always come to pass. To deny them is to go headlong into the darkness with no light to guide you.
18201,"It's good to see you in one piece, lass!"
18202,What's become of the Skeleton Key?
18203,"Mother, what's the meaning of this? Who have you brought into our home?"
18204,Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's all right.
18205,The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future.
18206,Something I can get for you?
18210,"Be seein' you, stranger."
18212,"I bet the two of us, we're very alike. So why not take the next step? We can help each other."
18213,Good luck. Come to Windhelm and talk to Ulfric. You won't regret it.
18215,"But enough of that... I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend."
18216,Ha ha ha ha!
18218,"Dead? No, no, no, no, no! This is terrible. I don't know you. Get away from me!"
18219,You're headed to the capital.
18222,I wasn't looking for trouble.
18223,Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.
18225,I only hope we can restore the Guild to its former glory after all the damage that's been done.
18229,I'm still sore where I took that arrow. I hate archers.
18230,"Use Dragonrend, Dovahkiin!"
18234,"I saw you. With the Forsworn. By the old gods, that was something."
18236,"No, it... it can't be."
18237,I'd like to give you this tome...it's one of Sinderion's greatest works. I believe you've more than earned it.
18238,Forsworn rampaging through the streets. As if business wasn't slow enough.
18240,"My wife and I think there's some dark magic at work. Or perhaps Arkay's influence is strong here, and he likes to keep it this way."
18242,Not here. We will meet at Reachcliff Cave.
18243,Can't believe Madanach is on the loose again. I hope those rumors I'm hearing about your part in that are wrong.
18244,Can't believe anyone was dumb enough to mistake you for a Forsworn agent.
18245,"Make your way to Northwatch Keep in Haafingar. I'll meet you near there, and we'll plan our assault."
18248,"I heard about you being pardoned. What were the guards thinking, taking you in?"
18249,"Ever since I was a boy, I felt this strange sense of destiny surrounding the Mythic Dawn cult, and now I know what it is."
18250,I'm starting to think we might not even find iron in here. We've been at it for so long.
18251,I don't have time for your foolishness. Either help me or be gone.
18252,I can't sleep here. The dreams are even worse than before.
18253,The Imperial agent? That's right. I knew. How many dogs is the Empire going to send after me?
18258,Damn those Forsworn. Think they can kill people in my city? I'll have Madanach's head!
18259,"I think some of them do, Lady Mjoll. They're just too frightened to step up and do something about it like you are."
18260,"By killing Madanach you've freed Markarth from his hidden tyranny. On behalf of the city, I thank you."
18262,"Madanach has been found to be the true murderer of Markarth. On behalf the city, I apologize for your wrongful imprisonment."
18265,The Silver-Bloods pay their debts. You have my thanks.
18266,I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards.
18268,May you return to Her Benevolence in safety.
18269,"Well, I only know what I've heard in the old tales. Shouting is an ancient form of magic - the use of one's voice to project their power."
18270,"Well, that's a different matter..."
18271,"Hey, ugly!"
18272,"Don't listen to him, he's making this up."
18273,"In fact, the night she disappeared, she was supposed to meet Alva."
18274,This is where it will begin. A new uprising.
18275,"Is that magic? Careful, please..."
18276,Blessings of the Eight Divines upon you. How may I help?
18279,The Reach will be ours again.
18280,"Yes, Thongvor. I'll draft the letter immediately. "
18281,"Their fires lit up the night. All across Lake Rumare, like stars come to earth. It was beautiful, really."
18282,"No, I'm not having a good time. My boy just married a gods-forsaken Imperial. Skyrim is full of eager Nord women, and he beds down with the enemy."
18285,"But perhaps the staff can absorb some of the energy coming out of the Eye, weaken it. Allow us to get close to Ancano."
18287,Fine. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
18288,"I don't know, not for sure."
18290,"Shor's bones, I might just have to!"
18291,I'm not certain what use it would be.
18293,"I'm afraid I don't see the connection, though."
18294,"Sooner or later, we all have to choose a side."
18296,"I don't know. If the Augur suggested it, there must be a good reason for locating it."
18297,Otherwise you could talk to the Jarl's pet wizard in Solitude.
18300,"We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned about."
18304,Keep it together! There's not many of us left!
18307,"No more than anyone else, I don't think."
18308,Then it got cold and dark. I'm not scared anymore.
18309,"Our chief is weakened. He will not rest, will not sleep. He suffers, and so the tribe suffers."
18311,"If nothing else, I'd take it as a compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel worthy."
18312,"But at least I know where to start now. Thank you, you've been a great help to me."
18314,"And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing!"
18316,"You did the best you could, brother. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point."
18320,"Now, maybe I don't pick up a blade in Ulfric's name no more, but I still hold with his ideals. Skyrim is Nord land, and we ought to rule it."
18321,Like what?
18322,"Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage when I was but an Apprentice here."
18323,This way.
18325,"Arniel wondered if perhaps they'd somehow managed to get themselves lost in the Outer Realms, but I think that's giving them too much credit."
18326,"Skyrim doesn't belong to you, Ulfric."
18327,"The cave has a bad history. Long ago, Potema the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name."
18328,But we've had no contact with them for quite some time now.
18331,"The Thalmor came seeking answers as well, unaware they will be his undoing."
18340,"It just feels right somehow, having this new life as an adventurer. It's what I was meant to do."
18341,"Sithis? Let me guess: ""In the Void!"" By the gods, you Dark Brotherhood are a predictable lot, aren't you?"
18342,Let me think... what were they working on?
18343,I hadn't really considered it in terms of time. I suppose it's been at least a month.
18345,I shall do my best.
18347,Those two boys were obsessed with mead. Convinced they could concoct something to compete with Honningbrew.
18349,"As I recall, Yisra was trying to improve flame cloak spells to better work in Skyrim's harsh environment."
18353,"Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering contracts we haven't had the chance to complete just yet."
18355,"And, soldier. You better help win me back Markarth, or die trying. It was your brilliant strategy to give it over to the rebels in the first place."
18357,I hope you're not here to start some trouble. I'll fight you if I have to.
18360,Why would anyone want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense.
18361,"Unfortunately Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a powerful master vampire that I had assumed was destroyed."
18365,Strike the targets as they appear. Breath and focus.
18366,"Esbern, look out!"
18367,What treachery?
18368,Oh dear.
18370,"If you have spare weapons and armor to sell, bring them here."
18372,That's some good armor you've put together.
18373,References to similar stones appear in lore throughout the various Tamrielic cultures.
18375,"Papa told you to do that, not me! Now leave me alone!"
18376,Well... just get it done.
18378,You're too slow!
18379,I'm Riften's appointed Steward. How can I help you?
18383,Yes? What is it?
18384,"Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I crave the fellowship of Sovngarde."
18388,"However, don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly."
18389,Legate.
18391,"Here, why don't you take this. It was intended to be given to the best in their group as a reward for their hard work."
18393,"Okay, okay!"
18397,"You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition."
18399,"I find your hand in my pocket, I'm going to cut it off."
18403,"But she's not going to get the better of me, oh no. I won't let it get to me one bit. That's what she's after."
18404,"She's threatened by me! By my skill as a wizard, by my elegance and posture, by my superior good looks!"
18405,It has its advantages. I've never liked having the Empire perched on my doorstep. And Riften would be easy to hold...
18407,Aye.
18408,"Look, I need to know. What's going on between you and Brynjolf?"
18409,"So you'll need his approval first. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you."
18411,"Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath."
18414,But what about the banning of Talos worship? Isn't that worth fighting about?
18415,What is life's greatest illusion?
18416,Shoot the left target.
18418,"I'm sorry mother, now that he's dead, I just want to know everything I can about him."
18420,"Shor's bones, boy. What did I tell you? "
18421,No... not like this...
18422,I haven't seen him in many years. I wonder what became of him...
18423,"I, ah, learned of a certain stone tablet said to be housed in Bleak Falls Barrow - a ""Dragonstone,"" said to contain a map of dragon burial sites."
18427,"Times have been good and bad since then, but some folks couldn't handle not ruling their own land. Those are the Forsworn."
18428,I need twenty of them for my current crop.
18430,Really? That would be a pleasant change.
18434,"The self-loathing enhances Pelagius' anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must bring the two into balance."
18435,I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through his things.
18437,"Head on, then. I'll keep an eye out."
18438,Spices? I'm certain I have no idea what you're talking about.
18439,"Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you."
18444,I regret nothing of what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind fogged or my heart grieved.
18445,"The excavation, Aicantar! Right after I finish my book. We'll start excavating Nchuand-Zel again."
18447,Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart.
18449,"But every now and then, one swims back."
18450,Yeargh!
18452,"The Jarl has too much on his mind right now, we won't be troubling him with this."
18454,"Sadly, I am resigned to just reading of its wonders through my research of the Skull."
18455,That's the last of them.
18456,The so-called prison in Riften leaks like one of their fishnets. This is what happens when you let thieves run your town.
18457,Weddings always make me cry. What am I supposed to do now that I'm the one getting married?
18458,"No surprise, but one of them's gotten out. Again."
18459,It's good to be away from the forge for a bit.
18460,Get it into the trap before it kills us all!
18463,"Ah, welcome to Angela's Aromatics. Can I help with some herbal needs?"
18465,It seems that law-breakers in the Pale have no desire to stay there. I don't blame them.
18466,"Master Borri will teach you ""Wuld,"" which means ""Whirlwind."""
18468,But it seems their criminals can't either and just want to get out.
18469,Shouldn't you be on your way to Whiterun?
18471,I'm sorry to have to send you to Hjaalmarch. I can't stand the smell of it myself.
18474,Truly? So maybe my mother isn't crazy after all.
18478,"Listener! Is that you? Oh, I knew you'd come. Send the best to defeat the best. Astrid knew her stupid wolf couldn't slay sly Cicero."
18479,I believe he was suggesting their presence causes him harm.
18480,"Hmm... Yes, I've heard about all that fuss. I myself know it's all a terrible, terrible misunderstanding. I'm quite sure you're innocent in all this."
18484,"This one wonders - do you have no clothes, or just like the feel of the wind?"
18486,"Very well, let's meet this evening and make the arrangements."
18487,I find it hard to believe this excavation was approved.
18488,My friend died. Things won't be the same without her.
18489,"One of them's escaped, and you're going to find that coward."
18490,It's good to be mining again.
18492,Here. I'd like you to have this as a token my friendship.
18493,I'm not going to talk to you until this mess is cleaned up.
18494,"Yes, but he offered it as an idea. Perhaps he hopes it will be helpful, but does not wish to risk personal failure."
18495,"Yeah, sure, I understand. No need to decide now."
18496,At this point they don't care what happens to her and neither do I. Best to just kill her and be done with it.
18497,"Papa says I won't see Roggvir any more, but he wouldn't tell me why not."
18499,"The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable."
18501,"What do you need, my friend?"
18502,"In Whiterun, mostly. Ennis handles the business arrangements, but I know that he has a few purchasers who give us a fair price."
18504,"Got some nice comfy beds at the Braidwood Inn, if you're looking to flop down somewhere."
18505,Be careful. This man is known to be dangerous.
18506,"You'll need Kahvozein's Fang, of course."
18509,You were given a vision? Are you serious?
18511,"We choose our battles, and you've chosen yours. Someone else can take care of it."
18513,"You will. Until then, you'll taste every potion you make before you sell it."
18515,"Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks."
18516,"Perhaps they moved on to greener pastures. Whatever the reason, lets be glad they're scarce."
18517,"Bit by bit, we bring honor to this land. And you've brought honor to the Companions. More importantly, some gold."
18521,Wait a moment... what's that?
18522,Some rich folk had a trinket stolen and they want us to get it back.
18523,"Yep. She said that the Jarl was planning a surprise raid on us, but she talked her out of it. Said she saved us a lot of trouble."
18524,"We keep the Reach safe. We flood Markarth with wealth, but does the Jarl listen to us when we want a say? No. "
18526,Get moving. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late.
18528,A wealthy family has... misplaced one of their heirlooms.
18529,We have a bit of a sensitive matter this time.
18530,Must be my imagination.
18531,What's happening?!
18533,I hereby grant you permission to purchase property in my city. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
18534,"Here. You were promised a reward for solving the crime, but I need one more favor from you."
18535,Then we should soon be selling arrows by the bushel. A sword is no good against a dragon.
18536,"Those hill people who call themselves ""the Forsworn"" show no mercy."
18537,"Remember, the Way of the Voice trains you for more than battle. Indeed, we believe that battle is the least of its uses."
18538,"Some don't even believe they exist, but the Falmer can be devious. Tunneling into homes, stealing off with valuables."
18539,The Great War... only thirty years past and already ancient history to most people.
18540,You're headed to Markarth.
18541,"I can't believe it's over. Twenty-five years in exile and just like that, it's done."
18542,"Vipir ""the Fleet."" The only man who's foolish enough to name himself after his bedroom prowess."
18543,Good to hear. You can be a difficult man to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
18545,You were at Helgen! 
18546,We're trusting you on this one. Bring honor to the Companions.
18549,Hmm... They know more of our plans than I thought... Not good...
18551,"Pleased enough, I suppose. At least they appreciate the ways and traditions of the Nord people."
18552,"Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden."
18553,"Yes, and I'm working on it, but I'm also trying to..."
18554,"Come on, you're not even trying!"
18555,"We are the messengers of death, you and I. Together, we will unleash the unholy wrath of our Dread Father, Sithis."
18558,"Yatul's been teaching me to hunt. I'm still learning, but she's the best teacher I could have."
18562,I've taken the first steps toward doing so already.
18563,Welcome to the Bards College. I am the headmaster here. How may I help you?
18565,"Give it here. They've asked for the utmost discretion on this matter, so I'll make sure it gets to them."
18566,Your selection looks very delicious. I'll take an apple.
18568,"The Nords don't appreciate us, but so what? I don't appreciate them right back."
18570,"Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin."
18571,It's the Imperials! Take cover!
18572,"Whoa, not so fast there, friend. You owe me money."
18573,Fool! What do you think you're doing?
18575,"Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan."
18579,Take care of yourself.
18580,Things have been a lot worse around here since Ulfric took over.
18582,"Now, if you're here on his behalf, I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on my original payment."
18583,"I think I've located another one of the Totems. Come with me, and we'll write ourselves into their history."
18585,I'm too upset to talk....
18586,"I'm not interested, Jaree. It doesn't matter how many times you ask."
18587,"Anyway, I'm glad my work at the Black-Briar Meadery keeps me busy. Helps me keep my mind off of things."
18588,"By Ysmir, are you thick, or just too new to know better?"
18589,"Carry on, soldier. This is all part of the Dragonborn's plan."
18590,Simple-looking objects that could channel the powers of the werewolf in new directions.
18591,I had once heard Skjor and Kodlak talking about the Totems of Hircine. 
18592,Want to come along?
18593,"The Forsworn? That's right. I'll say it. We all knew. Even that fat-headed, slave-driving Mulush knew. Just ask him about it."
18594,Looking for some armor? A weapon perhaps?
18595,Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!
18596,Are you out of your mind?
18599,"You're a traveller, correct? Have you been to Whiterun?"
18600,First Torygg and now Elisif. Damn those Stormcloaks. Let's hope that Erikur fares better than they did.
18601,I'm just doing what I'm told.
18603,"Oh, someone's going to get hurt, I just know it..."
18604,We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put Thorryg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on a silver plate.
18605,Let that be a lesson to you young pups. There is no challenge that magic cannot overcome.
18606,And damn the Moot! 
18607,Aaah!
18608,"No, but this one..."
18609,"It was a suicide mission! Astrid said as much. Yet here you stand, hale and hearty. "
18616,"Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be. "
18617,Auxiliary.
18618,It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause. Think about it.
18619,You're certain you've found it?
18620,Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound.
18621,"There are some that say the Dark Brotherhood is back, and stronger than ever. That they've made Dawnstar their home. Tell me - am I wrong?"
18622,"As a Nightingale, I took an oath and was sworn to secrecy."
18624,Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you.
18625,"Down at the docks. There are a few good spots, if you can avoid the East Empire Company workers and those Red Wave thugs."
18628,"I was working with Vex and we got inside with no trouble. We found the loot, and made our way out."
18629,"You know, I'm almost beginning to like you, but you haven't earned your place out of here yet."
18630,"I will make sure this finds its way to his tomb as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it, my child."
18632,Lurbuk?
18633,"With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late."
18637,"You're alive! I'm impressed! Galmar had his doubts about you, but I knew you'd pull through. You should speak with him. He's going to need your help."
18638,I believe Galmar gave you something to do. So go do it.
18639,"This is your last warning. Get away from there, or else."
18641,But to be outnumbered twenty to one...
18642,"We need to go upstairs, that's where she is! That's where the books are!"
18643,"I'm so sorry my husband. You must remember, they're at the Bee and Barb to drink, not to listen to a sermon."
18644,I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak material. 
18645,"You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think we'd be seeing you again. "
18646,What? We've got nothing to talk about until you come back from Serpentstone Isle.
18650,"Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim."
18654,"Prove your valor in the Pit! If you haven't got any valor, prove your pocketbook!"
18655,So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to leave. That's right. I'm done. Holiday... complete. Time to return to the hum drum day-to-day.
18656,You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that doesn't make you a Stormcloak. 
18662,"From what I hear, you're the one gave the Thalmor a black eye. Sure know how to pick your enemies, don't you?"
18666,"Come back when you're committed to the cause, or go join the Legion. They're taking anyone with a pulse these days."
18667,"Are we writing a letter, Lord?"
18669,This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!
18671,You must be talking about the caravan job...
18675,"Why to perform for my common man, of course! Why should only the courts and inns of wealthy towns be given the gift of music?"
18676,See you around.
18677,"""I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak..."""
18678,"Dragons are part of the natural order of the world. The Blades thought to change the order to suit themselves, by wiping out the dragons."
18680,That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A hero of the people. A true son of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
18681,"Such is our way! Such is the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!"
18683,"""All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim!"""
18686,"True or not, who would dare deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his brow?"
18687,"The Blackblood Marauders haven't been seen since the Icerunner attack, so my shipments have been more regular."
18688,"The crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion of the power of  every king who has worn it. "
18689,Move along.
18690,"""Maw unleashing razor  snow, Of dragons from the blue brought down, Births the walking winter's woe, The High King in his Jagged Crown."" "
18691,You come right to me if you find an unwashed floor or lumpy bed.
18692,Do you have anything even remotely fresh?
18693,The last one was warm up.
18697,"If the crown exists, it will be there."
18699,"There will be. Of that, you can be assured."
18700,"Yes, very good."
18702,You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift.
18705,Fine. Have it you way. A fight it is.
18706,My wife Beitild is dead. Can't say I miss that old sabre cat.
18707,"Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King Borgas - Korvanjund."
18710,"It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian campaigns."
18712,You'd better come inside. Quickly now. Thalmor agents have been seen in the Ratway.
18713,"You can waste your own time, not mine. An apprentice obeys his master. A good one does, at least."
18714,"Tell me, why have you slain those who profess to follow in my ways?"
18716,He must have been very convincing.
18718,"While I feel Ulfric's cause is just, my concern is for the people of The Rift."
18719,"You have the blood of the wolf in you. You'll need to build up your strength before you can call on it again, though."
18720,"Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I?"
18722,"Curses notwithstanding, the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers, are they not?"
18723,"I'm just the Housecarl. If you need something, you should speak to Kraldar."
18724,"Clan Battle-Born's got a proud lineage in Whiterun, but unlike the Gray-Manes, we've also got wealth."
18725,I hope I'll see you in Solitude. Good luck.
18726,A few people in the Warrens used to work here. Degaine broke some bones a while back. Eltrys quit. Cairine is too sick.
18727,Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.
18730,Your objective is Fort Dunstad.
18731,I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.
18732,Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what profane arts those elves cursed his remains.
18733,"My chief, Gharol threatens to have me work in the mines. You won't allow my pretty hands to dirty, will you?"
18736,Deliver this axe to Jarl Hrongar.
18737,I was actually just wondering if you had any family....
18739,I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.
18741,I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun.
18742,"Now I remember - you're that new member of the Companions. So you, what - fetch the mead?"
18746,I guess I was wrong.
18752,"My sister is blind. I've told her she shouldn't spend so much time with Yatul, but she won't listen. Thinks she's nice."
18753,"You should speak to my daughter, Evette. She's the brains of the family."
18755,"Yes, I heard. I think all of Skyrim knows by know."
18757,Been here ever since I left the Bards College. Turns out a few muscles earn more gold than a damn lute.
18758,"You're right, you're right. I just... I was sure it must have been them. If not the Thalmor, who? Or... what?"
18760,"Not now, lass. Karliah said it was important."
18765,Just shut up and keep out of sight.
18766,At last... the final Totem is ours. Let's go complete our set.
18767,"Unfortunately, the future is as obscured to us as it is to you. The overwhelming power of the Eye makes it difficult for us to see."
18768,The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.
18770,"That's it! That's the second Totem. Quickly, let's put it back with the other one."
18771,That definitely matches the description of the totem from Skjor's old book. Let's get it to the Underforge.
18773,"The Empire brought stability, assurance to the people of Morthal, even if they didn't appreciate it. Now what do they have?"
18775,"He was one of the strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come without a Shield-Brother."
18776,My girlfriend died. Things won't be the same without her.
18777,This is not the time for talk. Let's get to the Underforge and see what this can do.
18778,"In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood assassin."
18779,This is... he should not have gone alone. 
18780,Balgruuf refuses the Legion's right to garrison troops in his city.
18781,Hircine will bless us for finding his Totem.
18782,"How may I serve you, my Listener?"
18783,"I'll return my ancestors to Sovngarde, and you with them!"
18786,Okay. Well. That's all I've got.
18787,"I've smoothed things over with her for now, but you can forget your cut."
18788,I don't know what we do with it now. Maybe you can figure it out.
18789,Take care not to set anything on fire.
18790,"I've heard of them, but didn't think they were real. Have you ever seen one?"
18791,Travelers have been coming to Whiterun. They tell stories about dragons.
18792,Damn rebels.
18793,"If you can bring me three more, that would be helpful."
18794,"By Sithis, what... what happened?"
18796,I understand Korir's been complaining about our customers again.
18797,So you can tell that heartless Daedra bitch I'm done doing her dirty work.
18802,"Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got."
18805,"Need something? Talk to my brother, Elrindir."
18808,I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we had a heart like yours among our numbers.
18809,You are a very brave man. But I already knew that.
18810,Good to see you. Finally someone useful is around.
18812,"The circle of stones to the southwest? That's Secunda's Kiss. The giants hold it sacred, so tread carefully."
18813,"Him? Oh... Ah, name's Balablob or Malaclob, one of them funny Orc names. Talks real good, though. Not a savage at all."
18814,"So, what are your needs? Perhaps a pinch of this, and a bit of that? Hmm?"
18816,We want compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
18817,We're taking Dawnstar. Get down there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
18819,"That is the kind of thing Kodlak used to say. And he was right. But still, I'd like to see for myself."
18821,Snow-Hammer.
18823,Need your weapon repaired? Or could I interest you in a new one?
18826,"Well, that's one way to find out if they're real. I even know where we might find one. Lead on!"
18827,"It's a matter of time before the Jarl is coming to me asking for money. This mine is going to make me... I  mean us, rich."
18829,They say he killed twelve of the Imperial Legion and shattered their bones with his breath.
18830,"Yes! I like the way you think. There are whispers of where we might find one, too. "
18833,"What fragments we have are displayed in honor, but we always seek more."
18834,"Brynjolf pulled me in a few years ago. Said the Guild was lacking some muscle, so I joined up."
18838,I give you three days before you screw up and someone runs a knife across your throat.
18840,"Well, on to the business at hand then, hmm?"
18843,"The General and I have our disagreements, but he's the best hope for both the Empire and Skyrim."
18844,"Thank you, Harbinger."
18847,For the glory of the Companions! For Ysgramor!
18849,I will train better for the future.
18853,Hunh!
18854,Otherwise Vilkas will just say I was making it up.
18855,"I couldn't ask you to undertake such a trecherous journey, it would be a fool's errand."
18858,"Now, now, my friend. You must look on the bright side. If soldiers storm the city, there's a good chance your husband may get killed."
18859,You. Over here!
18860,"You'd do that for a stranger? I don't know what to say. Lead on, I suppose."
18863,"Dohaviin, your Voice is no match for mine!"
18865,"You're the one who put out the fire in the Lighthouse, right?"
18866,"Over a year ago, thieves broke into the college and made off with a lot of valuable things. Mostly gold and silver."
18867,"Of course, there is always work. My mind is someplace else, though."
18868,My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.
18870,Whoa! They killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
18872,"Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing."
18873,I didn't think you'd get pinched.
18874,Look at that fool.
18875,I wish to cleanse myself that I might know glory in the afterlife.
18876,Kodlak's final teaching. I think he was right about beastblood and Sovngarde.
18878,"Oh, if you see Shadr, remind him he still owes me that debt."
18880,You'll... pay for this...
18882,"Thank you, Harbinger."
18888,"Help me get out of here, and I'll help you find them. Please!"
18889,"I would be honored for you to accompany me, Harbinger."
18891,"We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this."
18892,"A strange kind of ritual, but I won't mind killing those wretched things."
18893,You must be another pilgrim on the way up to High Hrothgar. No other reason to pass through here.
18895,Let's go to the Tomb. We can do the cleansing there.
18896,"When the house is yours, return to me and I will present you the title."
18898,"It's not luck, it's mead I'm cursing."
18899,My soul is now prepared.
18900,"You still bear a head of the Glenmoril betrayers, yes? Then lead on, back to the Tomb of Ysgramor."
18903,Did you take the head?
18906,This is good. Could you show the way to the tomb again?
18907,"I'm going... as fast... as I can, you stupid she-devil. I don't see you... helping..."
18908,What? You're out of your mind. That old coot's more interested in dead dwarves than anybody around here.
18910,"I don't have any business with you, so get out of my face."
18916,No mercy for the weak!
18917,"I know, I know - we've just met. But think, by the time the party is over we'll no doubt be fast friends. I look forward to it."
18918,"I'll need this... No, no, useless trash... where'd I put my annotated Anuad?"
18919,"The longer we wait, the worse it gets."
18925,"Thank you for your help. I'm going to stay in the tomb for a while. My shame kept me out before, but now I want to see it."
18927,This is how a warrior should feel. Alive and aware. Not clouded with thoughts of the hunt.
18929,It's like relaxing into a warm mug of spiced mead. I'm losing aches I didn't know I had.
18930,How can I help?
18932,"Faralda can teach Destruction spells, and offers training in that school."
18933,"With respect, Jarl. You can't ask everyone to throw themselves against trained Legionnaires. Let's leave the fighting to the Stormcloaks."
18935,"Oh, you prefer to listen, eh? Of course, of course! The Listener listens! A joke! A funny joke! I get it."
18937,Now... I'd like to spend some time communing with Ysgramor. My soul is clean now. Perhaps he'll still welcome me when my time comes.
18938,Allow me to present you with this compensation for your selfless efforts.
18940,"I'll lead the way, but you'd better back me up."
18941,Thank you.
18943,I can breathe more deeply now. I can't smell your heart beating the way I used to. But my mind is... clear.
18944,"Nonetheless, many are drawn to these stones based on the local stories describing them as a source of significant power."
18945,I... it's like waking up out of a dream.
18948,Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.
18949,But the Elder Scrolls... they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one.
18951,"I'm the best warrior in Morthal, and that's no boast."
18952,Did I ask you to? Did you hear me say that?
18957,"I didn't lose a lover, Viola, I lost my wife. It's not the same thing."
18958,"And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand girl?"
18960,Many of the Empire's troops were Nords at that point. Some of them could even have been from around here.
18965,"Magic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place."
18966,"We're married. I guess we'll need to decide where we're living, won't we? You can always stay with me."
18967,Do you prefer heedlessness to my luminous glory? Go!
18968,"Judging from how well you handled those shopkeepers, I'd say you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you in our outfit."
18970,An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power.
18971,"There hasn't been a Dragonborn seen in the land for centuries. Not since Talos himself walked the 7,000 Steps to High Hrothgar."
18973,"Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head."
18974,"I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions."
18976,"I'm doing as you asked. This is for some good purpose, yes?"
18980,Dead! Someone's going to pay for this.
18981,Please make sure this arrives in a timely manner. And don't scratch it up.
18982,"We've done it. The Star has been cut off from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence."
18983,Best tell the Jarl.
18985,It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.
18986,"You think that even if I did have one here, I would let you see it?"
18988,Of course.
18989,"The stones aren't what bother me, love. The Forsworn are tearing the Reach apart."
18991,"Don't know his name, but there is a guy like that hiding out down here. Paid plenty for nobody to know about it."
18993,M'aiq hears many stories of war... yet few of them are true.
18994,"They have clashed with the Aldmeri Dominion before, and I have no intention of allowing that to happen here."
18996,What about... wait. Are you? Were you the one the Greybeards were calling? 
18997,Why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke?
18998,"I was one of the few who escaped. For a long time, all I cared about was staying alive, and taking revenge on the Thalmor when I could."
18999,"Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should."
19000,Right you are! Guess I'll keep training you... for now.
19001,Spriggans. Niels went down before we even knew to run. Ari died just inside. I never even thought the things were real.
19002,What... What was that? Everything seemed to shimmer for a moment.
19005,I don't have time for this foolishness. Now come along quietly and we won't have to get rough.
19008,Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.
19009,"Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading."
19010,It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts.
19011,Some day soon I'll stop being afraid. Jouane is teaching me magic. He says I'm real good.
19012,I can't believe it's come to this.
19014,I'm innocent. The Nords framed me. I was nowhere near that murder weapon.
19017,"The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them."
19018,"""May the scales of the dragonkind splinter at the touch of your arrows and crack under the weight of your sword."""
19021,There's no honor in being a Jarl's servant. No Sovngarde waits for dust cleaners.
19023,"You can help us with that, and make sure no one else gets hurt."
19028,I'm going back to Narzulbur. Want to see how it's come.
19029,Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?
19033,Need a few spare septims? I got the cure right here.
19035,I'm sort of hoping you're going to fight the dragons for us. A normal man is no match for a dragon.
19036,"I am Uglarz, huntress of all."
19037,"Yes, Legate."
19038,"If there's ever any way I can assist you, please let me know."
19040,"Wise move. Now get out of here ya goat licker, before I decide the toll's gone up."
19041,It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.
19042,My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
19044,A letter... not sure who from. He wouldn't say. Just that he was a friend of yours.
19045,Damn Stormcloak rebels.
19047,"I think of Uglarz. An old friend. When we were little she ran to the woods to hunt, and never came back."
19051,But seriously. What's the message?
19053,I need to get back to the customers. We'll talk more of this when I come home tonight.
19056,I've had several wives. But each dies sooner than the last.
19058,"The mine is rich, and so are we. "
19059,"Finally, we can reopen the mine and put Shor's Stone back on the map!"
19060,"On rumor and gossip? No. But you, a stranger, might find the truth for us."
19061,"Your family? You've poisoned the Reach with your tainted silver for long enough, Thonar!"
19062,"Through neglect. During the Great War, they let the unwashed natives retake the Reach and declare their own sovereignty."
19066,He's my son. I just... I feel it in my heart. You'd understand if you had children.
19067,"He never returned. From the journal you discovered, I'm sure you know the rest."
19070,The Twilight Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield it from those who would exploit its power.
19071,"She said you stay in there, and that's final."
19075,"Maybe so, but we shouldn't be making concessions before negotiations even start. Makes us look weak."
19076,How'd you end up here?
19082,Keep an eye on these Thalmor. You never know...
19083,So you were right. Go tell the Jarl. Hurry!
19085,Can't say I mind the sight of all the Imperial guards. It's a change for the better.
19086,"Right, then."
19087,"I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I bought it."
19088,You're not getting anything from me!
19089,I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside.
19090,"No, this was a specific one. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it."
19091,...is there singing in the Void? Dancing...? Surely the Dread Lord will at least allow poor Cicero to caper...
19092,"Quite simple really, I don't know what the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill."
19093,I heard those Forsworn out west live in caves. Can't be any worse than trying to live in Windhelm.
19098,"Take out Haldyn, and we'll handle the rest."
19099,"I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations."
19103,"My advice? Always be honest with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know. "
19104,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
19105,"Next, you'll have to... Are you still paying attention?"
19108,Watch it!
19110,"Oh, he was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love."
19112,It was always just before dawn. The whole world was in darkness.
19113,Your name's been cleared... by Thonar Silver-Blood. Consider yourself lucky.
19114,Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
19115,Did you know that candle on the mantle hasn't gone out in over a hundred years?
19117,"Wrong on all accounts, aren't I?"
19118,"Ah, so my reputation as a lover precedes me. Care to reconsider?"
19119,Is this that dwarven city? I hear the treasure from their ruins is worth a fortune.
19120,Your latest exploit certainly has the Sanctuary talking...
19121,Karliah?
19122,The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform.
19124,I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others.
19125,"If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. She honors us all."
19126,"If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. He honors us all."
19127,I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone who's anyone in Skyrim.
19129,Do not cross the bridge unaided!
19131,"What will you do now, my love?"
19132,Come and see me again sometime. I might have some use for you.
19133,"Be careful out there... wouldn't want to lose such a promisin' cutpurse now, would we."
19134,"Well, you got Maven, she pretty much runs the whole operation. She's got friends in high places if you know what I mean."
19135,Will I ever see you again?
19136,"Buying one of our blades wouldn't hurt your chances, though."
19137,"When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again."
19139,"Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open... walk with the shadows."
19140,"Find enemy controlled resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, and sabotage them."
19141,Again? But there shouldn't be any earthstreams over there. 
19142,"Please, just... just leave me be!"
19143,"Goodbye, Karliah."
19144,Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll do all the research we need to figure out what we're dealing with.
19146,"Everyone in town knows about the Black Door, and to never go near it."
19148,"Ever since that Imperial craven ran me through from behind, I've had trouble breathing. Don't have any trouble drinking though."
19149,Thanks for the business.
19151,Indeed.
19152,"Keep looking. Someone's here, I can feel it."
19154,I'm ready for this party to be over.
19155,"Well, well. Look at you. The Nords have turned you into an animal. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad."
19158,"Now, Dovahkiin! Now he is vulnerable!"
19166,"If you're getting involved in this, that'd be where you start looking."
19168,Kren sosaal!
19171,"You treat a horse well, it'll take you to Oblivion and back."
19173,"I've read the dragon language, but to hear it spoken is most interesting."
19174,Good timing. The people in this home recently got one of your fellow Guild mates sent to jail. How about you make them pay for it.
19178,I couldn't ask for a better teacher than Oengul.
19179,You have the gold yet or what?
19181,"I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there."
19182,We are routed! Fall back!
19184,I heard some of the sailors talking about how they stashed a bottle of Double-Distilled Skooma in the Gnisis Cornerclub. I just need a taste.
19187,"We just need the shards of the blade and the hilt, now."
19189,"If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call."
19191,I'm listening.
19192,Carrying around a weight like that... it hurts after a while. Cuts you inside like a dagger to the heart.
19197,There are no expectations. This College is a place to study and practice magic freely.
19198,"Listen, could you take the sword to my father, Proventus Avenicci? He's the Jarl's steward. He'll know the right time to present it to him."
19203,"How are your chores coming, son?"
19205,He's a true Nord. He'll come around.
19206,Don't be so sure of that. We've intercepted couriers from Solitude. The Empire's putting a great deal of pressure on Whiterun.
19208,"If he's not with us, he's against us."
19209,He knows that. They all know that.
19210,"By Ysmir, you'll pay for that!"
19212,How long are you going to wait?
19213,Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?
19214,"Don't get too flowery on me, lass."
19217,My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog. 
19218,"All I want it is to escape from this madness. And if Olfina can come with me, all the better. But I've probably said too much."
19219,You think I need to send Hrongar a stronger message.
19220,"And now the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is weakened, the Empire is weakened."
19221,You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.
19222,"Hard to say. The weather's taken a bit of a turn, here."
19224,If by message you mean shoving a sword through his gullet.
19225,"So, what do we have here? Hmm. Let me guess."
19226,There is one who I remember well. Odahviing. He is the one to tell us where Alduin has gone.
19227,"We haven't much time for discussion, but what did you need?"
19228,"Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful statement, don't you think?"
19229,Why are my research materials constantly disappearing?
19232,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in the Reach.
19236,"Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But some days, Hjorunn's too drunk..."
19237,"I heard Brynjolf wants to see you about being Guild Master. I suppose my turn will come one day, but for now you'll do nicely."
19239,Ah. Of course. Not everyone has an appreciation for the artistic wonders of the world.
19242,We're ready when you are.
19243,Tsk. What a man will do for a few coins...
19245,I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face here.
19248,Mzinchaleft. I swore I'd never return here.
19251,The people are behind you.
19252,You dare try and steal from me?
19253,Most people in Skyrim don't care for Dunmer. Roggi's the only one around here even half-decent.
19254,"Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation."
19255,Then let them die with their false kings.
19256,"You may have noticed the College, just to the north there. Very prestigious place. Mages from all over Tamriel traveled here to seek knowledge."
19257,"This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business."
19258,"Oh come off it, Niv. We both know you married that fisherman for his gold. You don't need to put on an act for my benefit."
19260,"I work for them. The inn is named after them. When the guards make an arrest, they check with them first."
19261,Your blood will adorn my blade!
19262,"Take great care, and know that the Order is watching."
19263,They have families to think of.
19264,How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their families.
19265,"Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?"
19266,"I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that."
19268,Thanks.
19269,I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?
19270,"I fight for their wives and children, who's names I heard whispered in their last breaths."
19271,"Oh, that. Err, yes. It's... It's quite promising, I believe. Definitely on the right track. Results, err, results should be soon."
19273,"Remember always this: You need answer to no authority, neither mortal, nor divine... As you will it, so it shall be."
19274,"I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil."
19275,"I fight for my people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves!"
19276,"I fight for we few who did come home, only to find our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces."
19277,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
19279,I fight so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing. 
19281,Faleen... I...
19283,That dragon should've stuck with killing Imperials. Now he's going to learn how real Nords fight.
19284,"Married. It doesn't feel like I thought it would, but I'm happy. Where should we live? You could stay with me...."
19286,"But the day words are enough, will be the day when soldiers like us are no longer needed."
19287,"So I'll ask again, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?"
19289,Don't touch that dagger! It's mine.
19292,"Well, there's an Imbuer here in the Great Hall."
19294,"Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you walk among adders."
19297,Many have braved the shadowed vale but vain is all courage against the peril that guards the way.
19299,"You're the one who returned blessed Sheogorath. I would be honored to be Wabbajacked by you, your grace."
19300,It's just one of those things that happens. The lungs just... give up. Even elves get old. 
19302,Ahhh. Yes...
19305,"A fair point... Well, you've come to the right place, then. Speak with Galmar. "
19308,Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.
19309,"So long as your criminal past stays in the past, and you fight for me with honor and integrity, we'll welcome you into our ranks."
19310,"I see you have meditated on this subject quite thoroughly. I shall not stop you, but please, try to attend to your temple duties as well."
19313,Any word about our little problem in the Ratway?
19314,I'll carve you into pieces!
19316,"Well, this is Falkreath. Not much to look at if you're used to the bigger cities, but the folk here are friendly enough if you give them a chance."
19317,I'm always looking for able fighters. Not everyone can say they made it out of Helgen.
19318,"You've got a lot of nerve, suggesting something like that, to me of all people! If this was Riften, I'd have you thrown in the dungeon!"
19320,"Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through all that, you're likely worth something to me."
19322,"I try to include her in my lessons from Maramal over at the Temple of Mara, but she prefers to shop instead. Different strokes, eh?"
19324,"First, our intelligence suggests one of the rebel garrisons has become disaffected. If we play our cards right, we should be able to turn them."
19325,That's what I like to hear.
19327,"Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?"
19328,The kind men use to measure themselves. 
19329,"With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor."
19330,Two Imperial drunks who thought they were above the law.
19332,"Nothing but a bunch of lowly bandits. Cowards, who will take little effort."
19334,"You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and I'll have all the proof I need about you."
19336,What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?!
19342,"Let's hope you can show that his heart was not deceived. Good luck, my friend."
19343,Then stop wasting my time.
19344,"There's a strange rock formation, built by the ancients. Something about that place attracts the Ice Wraiths."
19348,Could sure use a warm bed right about now...
19350,Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work.
19352,"But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. Left it here to decay. Until you came."
19353,Enough!
19355,"Patience isn't exactly my strong suit, but alright."
19356,I hate it here. Grelod the Kind is the meanest person in all of Skyrim.
19358,"Before you can stand next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own."
19359,"Changed your mind? Well, I can't give up so easily. I'm heading back."
19360,"At the end of the day, every warrior is alone."
19361,"Sorry, Marise. I just can't sit back and watch them treat us like a resource. This is our home!"
19362,"Ah finally, someone besides the stupid guards to talk to."
19363,Talos guard you.
19364,"A sale? To attract new customers? Camilla, everyone in Riverwood already shops here. There are no more customers."
19365,I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...
19367,"The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, ""Jarls"" - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order."
19369,"You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it."
19370,"No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden."
19372,"When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak."
19373,"Well, aren't you sweet? I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me."
19374,Just take a step back and let me figure this out. Then we'll talk.
19375,"When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak."
19378,Try not to die.
19379,Here. Take this. You'll need it. Use it on the island. Don't lose it. That's all the help you're getting.
19380,Meat from fresh kills.
19381,"We'll see about that, won't we?"
19382,What in the world?
19383,My family is everything to me.  Clear the fort and on top of the posted reward you can have whatever items you'd like.
19386,"But he hasn't returned yet, so I'll need to wait for his account. For now, speak with Galmar."
19387,Ralof's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good man.
19392,"Gladly. He won't bother you anymore, I promise."
19393,"So, name your poison! Ha ha ha. Oh, I never get tired of that one!"
19395,"Dorthe... I was thinkin' I'd knit a couple of blankets, sell them to Lucan. Would you like to make one? Might be fun, workin' together."
19398,Derkeethus used to take me diving way down deep in the river. I miss him.
19400,"But first, tell me. Why's a Breton want to fight for Skyrim?"
19401,Hey! What are you trying to pull?
19402,You men are utter pigs... you only care about one thing.
19403,"Thoring, do you remember the time when that wolf pack come clamoring into town?"
19404,Ysgramor was the hero who started the Companions. Wuuthrad was his weapon.
19405,"I don't care if Vex was chosen as a Guild Third over me, she deserved it."
19406,We'll see about that. Won't we boys?
19407,"Nice try, blossom, but I'm not a knight, I'm a mercenary. The answer's still no. Besides, your mother would miss you too much."
19409,We'll cross once it's safe.
19410,"But first, tell me. Why's an Orc want to fight for Skyrim?"
19411,Come on. Sounds like trouble.
19412,"But first, tell me. Why's a cat want to fight for Skyrim?"
19415,"But first, tell me. Why's an Elf want to fight for Skyrim?"
19417,We're not looking for sellswords. The Stormcloaks need dedicated men and women who're devoted to the cause and willing to die for it.
19420,What do you expect to find? My juggling balls? He he.
19421,"If I hadn't sunk every bit of gold I had into my mill, I would have picked up and left Ivarstead long ago."
19423,No need to get rough!
19424,Another soul for the master!
19425,You're clear to enter.
19426,"Oh, thank you, but I should be fine now that you've shown me the way. But those bandits have to be stopped!"
19427,Awful damn cold up here. And only the guests are allowed inside. Damn foreigners and their inhospitable ways.
19428,My husband and I were just recently married.
19432,You even think of taking something from my house... and I'll kill you.
19433,Gaius Maro still lives. I am surprised. I had assumed you were more... competent.
19434,I see.
19435,It is time for us to go.
19437,Mother!
19438,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Rift.
19439,That's the end of that.
19440,"You assured me that you could find it, however."
19442,Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?
19446,"It's an honor to have Viarmo for instruction on drum, but he's far too reserved for my tastes."
19449,The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
19450,"All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you."
19451,"If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use it as leverage."
19452,"Go, leave me in peace."
19453,"If you found any of the sap, I'd be willing to pay you the same cut I offered him. Better price than you are likely to find otherwise."
19454,Did you? So Ulag didn't make it passed those giants then? More's the pity.
19456,"Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim."
19460,Why not? Business has been terrible. Most folk would rather hunt their own meat than buy ours.
19462,"So it's okay if your people rebel against the Empire, but not mine?"
19463,"I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say."
19467,"But every family in the Reach has a story like mine. There are no innocent onlookers in this struggle. Just the guilty, and the dead."
19468,For Whiterun and Skyrim!
19469,I'm not Madanach. I was never a leader of the Forsworn. The only anger I can justify is my own.
19471,"If you need a bow, there's one on the rack to the left of the door."
19472,"Exactly. When you have a big heavy weight swinging around your upper body, your lower body has to compensate or you'll fall right over."
19476,"Goodness, that's it, isn't it?!"
19479,To even consider it would be such a sign of weakness that I might as well abandon my tribe now.
19481,Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send her back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
19482,"Your meddling above ground reminded me of how removed I've been from the struggle. My men and I should be in the hills, fighting."
19483,"Speaking of sounding good, I've heard a couple of your classmates on the street recently."
19484,"Imagine hearing a story like that, over and over. Each time a different family Each time a different injustice."
19486,"Yes, but I need a show of loyalty from you. I don't need a shiv in the back while we break out."
19487,By the gods!
19492,"All right, Wilhlem. I suppose it's the least I can do for you."
19493,What? No. No don't kill me. Please!
19501,"Let's see... you have the symbol for ""King""... and ""Warrior""..."
19502,Walk away. Now.
19503,"He's outlived his minor usefulness. Take care of him, and then we can leave Cidhna Mine for good. "
19504,He has to be lying!
19505,"Have you met Grisvar the Unlucky? He's rightly named, and he's also a thief and a snitch."
19507,It's the waiting that gets me.
19509,"By now I can barely contain his power, much less defeat him if he awakens. But with the help of a living champion I may be able to succeed."
19514,"The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere in Skyrim. They inquired about the ruins of Mzulft, but that's all I remember."
19515,We're mounting our final attack on Solitude. Get over there and join the rest of the army. They'll be launching the attack soon. Talos be with you!
19518,I need more children.
19523,Well... if you say so.
19524,"Some of us wanted to find out how. I was working under Malyn Varen, then. If only we knew what he was really planning."
19526,So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know that?
19527,Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day now.
19529,"The round one, for tuning. Dwemer music is soft and subtle, and needed to open their cleverest gates."
19530,Not much more to tell. This dragon flew over and just wrecked the whole place. Mass confusion.
19532,You got here just in time.
19535,"We're outnumbered, but I have a plan."
19536,"We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're right behind you."
19539,"Ah, that is good to hear, then."
19542,"Lucky for us, that the wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now. Just up the road!"
19543,"Shor's blood, what have they done?"
19546,That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in handy.
19548,You got here just in time.
19549,"Besides, the Thalmor reward their friends richly. Anyone who doesn't take advantage of that is a stubborn fool."
19550,Let's get this over with.
19551,"Come on, now."
19552,"Boziik, Dovahkiin. Nuz mey."
19555,Het siiv nunon dinok.
19556,"Any further dishonor done to my kin, and I'll put you in the ground."
19557,"What's this? Is it spoiling for a fight? If not, it should hide its weapon away."
19558,Alduin saraan hin sil ko Sovngarde!
19559,I spend a lot of time at the market stalls so I can learn the merchant's trade.  I need more experience if I'm going to run an inn someday.
19563,Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe she found what she was looking for in there.
19564,"A captive dragon, just think of the possibilities!"
19566,"Keep up the effort, young one. Eyes on the horizon, always."
19568,Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing.
19569,I'll be glad when that beast is gone from Dragonsreach. I never understood what the point of all this was.
19570,Ulfric Stormcloak would say that I owe my allegiance to the Nord people as they fight for Skyrim's independence. Perhaps this is also true.
19571,Mir!
19573,So my brother really did it. Whiterun will be the toast of Skyrim for this!
19574,A dragon in Dragonsreach. That's something I never saw coming.
19575,A citizen of the Rift has been kidnapped.
19576,You can't beat me!
19577,Well said.
19580,Mercer's here. I can feel it.
19582,Is it true? Did you really capture a dragon on the Great Porch?
19584,"I don't trust them. Come to think of it, I don't trust you either, but at least you're family."
19588,Who do you think killed more rebels? You? Or me?
19591,Just glad all that business with Malyn is over with. What did you need?
19592,"I also oversee the activities of the Thalmor Justiciars throughout Skyrim, although this has been unfortunately disrupted by the war."
19594,One of my main duties is to foster a better understanding between the Aldmeri Dominion and the people of Skyrim.
19595,I see why the Nords like Skyrim. This crisp air is wonderful for the lungs!
19597,But I'm sure you didn't come here for a lecture on high politics.
19598,Back to my book...
19601,"The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of."
19602,"The Empire and the Dominion agreed that the worship of Talos was a relic of the past, and must be eliminated in the interests of peace."
19603,Again? Are you sure? He still hasn't answered your last several requests.
19605,"Following the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat set out the terms for peaceful coexistence between the two powers."
19606,Can we talk later?
19607,"Brother! Mara's mercy, you're safe! Your friend told me about Helgen..."
19609,This one angered someone pretty high up in the keep. Can I count on you to get this done for me?
19610,The worship of the false god Talos contributed to the unfortunate friction that led to the Great War.
19611,Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet?
19613,"It... It's very valuable. Critical to my work, and one-of-a-kind. That's all I care to say for now."
19615,"As long as the Empire continues to uphold its treaty obligations, my government does not concern itself with the internal politics of Skyrim."
19617,You want something from me?
19619, 
19620,"When one can divine the future, success may not be assured... but it can at least be anticipated. It helps that I've already foretold my own death."
19623,"It's a bad time to be a criminal, what with these murders going on."
19624,Prey waits.
19625,Alduin mahlaan
19626,I'll be fine.
19627,"Yes, he matches the description of this Esbern guy you're looking for. Maybe it's him. Maybe it isn't."
19628,Do I? And what about you? What right did you have to meddle in my affairs? Kill my people? Was it worth it? Your truth?
19632,"You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of the Nord stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you."
19634,"You get used to the cold after a while. The harder you work, the warmer you stay."
19637,"You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of your kinsmen stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you."
19638,"If you ever want to replace those old rags, stop by Radiant Raiment."
19639,"Very well. Come for me, then. Come and let's end this!"
19640,By Ysgramor!
19641,This will only take me a moment...
19642,"Ponder the meaning of spirit. Unslaad zii. Where mortal flesh may wither and die, the spirit endures."
19643,I know you. Where was it? Hm. Oh! You were getting something for me?
19644,"Oh, yes. Hunting is my great passion."
19645,Mmm. That felt nice.
19647,"What an interesting idea. I think if someone were to do something like that, there would definitely be a certain amount of loot to be shared..."
19648,Tell him I sent you. Ask him why he's here. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.
19649,"There's a man named Braig inside these mines. Besides me, he's been here the longest."
19653,"If you change your mind, speak to Braig. Tell him I sent you. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is."
19654,"Well, not exactly."
19655,"So many say that, at first, until they realize the truth."
19658,That's close enough.
19660,Some of us refused to bow. We knew the old ways would lead us back to having a kingdom of our own.
19661,Bye.
19662,This was our land. We were here first. Then the Nords came and put chains on us. Forbid us from worshipping our gods.
19663,Your kind - joorre - mortals - created it as a weapon against the dov... the dragons.
19665,"And I have. Humiliating at first, but I knew he would let his guard down eventually. That he would come to trust I was under control."
19666,"Thonar Silver-Blood stopped it. He wanted the Forsworn at his call, that I would point their rage at his enemies and spare his allies."
19667,"Retribution was swift. I was captured, quickly tried, and sentenced to death. But my execution never came."
19668,"I had Markarth. My men and I drove the Nords out. We had won, or so we thought."
19673,Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the Nords take these things.
19675,Being in exile is the most humiliating thing I've experienced in my life.
19676,"And why would you be looking for me, hmm? I'm not sure I appreciate your presence here. Friend."
19677,"I'm not ""afraid"" of anything. I simply prefer quality merchandise. No, no this meat won't do at all. Too much fat, and it all smells... wrong."
19678,Thank you.
19679,The Thalmor never forget.
19680,"Die, foul orc!"
19681,You did this city a great service by catching that killer. Well done.
19683,"Of course, because of our separation, Vile is now much weaker. I guess he figured it was a small price to pay for not having to listen to me anymore."
19684,I did ask. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
19685,What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.
19686,Generally posting information is need to know only.
19688,I can't wait to learn from the priestesses.
19690,Well done. You have now passed all the trials.
19694,Such an abrupt end to our game.
19700,Do you have any family? Anyone waiting for you on the outside?
19704,"And after they made me watch as her head rolled off the block, they threw me in here anyway, to dig up their silver."
19705,But my little Aethra didn't want to see her papa leave her. She pleaded to the Jarl to take her instead.
19708,"The Nords didn't care who was and who wasn't involved in the Forsworn Uprising. I had spoken to Madanach once, that was enough."
19709,There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.
19710,Hmm... All right... How about this?
19711,"You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy."
19712,"I had a daughter, once. She'd be 23 this year. Married to some hot-headed silver worker or maybe on her own learning the herb trade."
19713,"Ah, at last! I hope you found the place all right."
19714,"Oh come now, this is mead... not some wine to be sipped and savored."
19719,"If you don't mind a piece of advice, I'd stay out of trouble in Markarth. They'll toss you in the Cidhna Mine, and you'll never get out."
19720,Hope nobody misses that...
19721,The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it the Tower of the Dawn.
19722,How much longer do we have to work this backwoods mine?
19723,"I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was established inside."
19724,"I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry."
19725,When the temple was active the priests would rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary existence.
19726,We'll meet you there. Be careful. That part of the Reach is rough country these days.
19728,Don't plan on bringing anything else in with you. The Thalmor take security very seriously.
19729,The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't it... a ruin within a ruin?
19732,You're pathetic!
19733,Jarl Igmund can refuse to see me all he wants. The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
19735,Let's hear it.
19738,He's deceiving you.
19739,"When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you."
19740,"Day-to-day operations are my responsibility, which means if you become a problem, you get sent to me."
19743,"At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger."
19744,"On your way up the 7,000 Steps again, Klimmek?"
19746,You want to work on something that's not officially allowed? Don't tell anyone you're doing it.
19747,"Well, well. Look who it is! How have you been?"
19756,Then there's no time to lose. It won't take long for Sarthis's associates to learn of his death.
19757,"Release the Miasma! Release it now! Hurry, Casimir, hurry!"
19758,We'll get him when he comes back around. Hold your fire.
19761,"When you've been doing business like I have for decades, you quickly discover that the only person you can trust is yourself."
19762,"You'll only have what Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside."
19763,What? Why would he do such a thing?
19764,Troll's blood! It's a torture room.
19765,Great.
19767,"I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat."
19768,I... shouldn't say that.
19769,"Wolves, trolls, mammoths and giants would all like to make a meal of us."
19771,"Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again."
19773,"It is a thankless task and I would rather be back home in Elsweyr, but I have little choice."
19774,"Rulindil, pah! One day, the shoe will be on the other foot."
19775,Hin laas los dii.
19778,Bah!
19780,Why should we settle for half a fin when we could just take the whole whale?
19781,"...mead, mead, mead... ...kill 'em to get some beer every now and then? ...stupid bees and their stupid honey..."
19782,But I do less business than I used to. The Stormcloaks don't like buying from anyone that isn't a Nord.
19784,All right. I'll lay off him. Just leave.
19787,"Well, not a great deal, no."
19789,Lead. I'll follow.
19791,"Well uh, Endon is a silversmith in Markarth, so I just assumed..."
19793,Are you sure? I'll need to ask them to take an oath to leave their old life behind and stay here from now on.
19794,I've been noting a pattern to when the killings happen. 
19795,"Besides, I'm sure your being imprisoned was all a terrible misunderstanding. "
19797,"Not sure, let's watch and find out."
19799,"So, not much has changed, really."
19800,"On the other hand, they're a violent bunch. Every night a fight breaks out and I end up with a smashed chair or a broken table."
19804,Black Briar? How dare you shove that swill in my face. I'd rather drink mammoth drool!
19805,"At least Balgruuf's men bathed regularly. These Stormcloaks always smell of ale and sweat, and their breath reeks."
19807,No more than I was already getting.
19812,I think she would be happy to know that our collection has brought smiles to faces both young and old.
19815,"My sister passed away some years ago, so I settled down here and opened the House of Curiosities."
19816,I knew something was up. I'll make sure he doesn't disrespect this place anymore. Honesty is a rare thing to find these days. Thank you.
19817,"As we journeyed across Tamriel, we encountered tales of exotic and wondrous artifacts. We decided to collect as many as we could."
19818,"Well, did you bring back any mead?"
19821,Fine. Take your books and leave at once.
19822,But... there's no way to know what Shout is meant.
19826,"You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds."
19827,"Indeed I did! For a few septims, I'll tell you about some of the most interesting curiosities in my collection."
19829,A new hand touches the beacon.
19830,"Splendid! If you'll just follow me, I'll tell you tales and show you wonders such as you've never seen."
19832,Is my staff seeing to your needs?
19833,Good job. Take this in return.
19836,You wanted to see me?
19838,"I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!"
19839,"I've been there before, but I don't know it well."
19842,"Hardly! In fact, I don't know how I get anything done with all of the distractions I have to put up with."
19843,I was trained by some of the finest warriors in all Skyrim to wield a blade as if it was an extension of my own arm.
19844,Vulwulf has been quite generous to let me take care of their farm considering I am not part of their family.
19847,Ah! A fellow Nord! I trust you're bringing the fight to the Empire.
19854,Milk drinker.
19856,Mmm hmm. Anything else?
19857,"Another trap, most likely. Things are dangerous... three of the guards died when the lower hall flooded with steam last week. "
19859,We've got to get inside. Now!
19860,"I shall teach you a spell to discern things hidden from others. With it, you will be able to acquire the texts you need."
19861,"Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is."
19863,Rogue wizards. I've never trusted magic types. The College is bad enough. Destroy them.
19866,Where are you going? The barracks is through here!
19867,Fair enough.
19868,Come on! We need to get inside!
19869,"When Ulfric Stormcloak becomes High King, Skyrim will finally be the way my ancestors intended. It's a new day in Markarth."
19872,"I remember Skyrim from my youth, and the glistening crimson on fields of white."
19874,It was nice to meet you.
19875,Check your map.
19876,"Very well. If you change your mind, you can usually find me here. In the meantime, feel free to look around."
19878,"Tell Cicero the time has come. Tell him the words he has been waiting for, all these years: ""Darkness rises when silence dies."""
19879,"If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do."
19881,"Let me guess. You'd rather play ""Daedra and Battlemages"" with Ordnar. Or go fishing, or catch frogs..."
19883,Don't you worry about him. I've sent my best men to round him up.
19885,Yah!
19887,"Of course not! What will you offer for Riften, Tullius? Some empty promises? Maybe some more Imperial bluster?"
19888,"Some see only blank pages, and nobody knows why. Perhaps some of us are born with no destiny, or maybe the blank pages signify an imminent death."
19889,"The writing in the book describes the destiny of its reader, so the words change from one person to the next.  "
19890,"We stashed what we couldn't carry, and I hid it with a trick I know. I can point you in the right direction, and we'll each go our separate ways."
19894,I'm already looking forward to getting back above ground.
19896,"Ah, now here is an item out of legend. This is Ysgramor's Soup Spoon. "
19898,I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.
19900,"Otherwise you can try the Jarl's wizard. I wouldn't, though."
19901,"None know its origins, but the stories say that men who hear its music are compelled to dance uncontrollably, no matter the peril."
19902,"Legend holds that the Dancer's Pipe has won wars, toppled empires and changed the very course of history."
19903,Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
19905,"Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps..."
19909,"Oh, got more to say?"
19910,"Your payment awaits. And don't worry, I'm not stupid enough to betray you."
19911,"Black-Briar Mead is just fine, if you need something to wash the dirt off a riding horse's hooves."
19912,The old tales say that he can travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
19915,"Oh, Sayma would have my hide if I even suggested I might step foot on a battlefield."
19918,There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful.
19919,And finally take the fact that the College is the only thing left standing after most of Winterhold was destroyed. It's all fairly damning.
19920,You found what?
19921,"Right now, the Guild needs someone to maintain order. Everyone is awaiting the news of Mercer's demise; it couldn't be a more precarious time."
19923,This information needs to go straight to the steward. He'll listen to you. 
19924,"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
19925,"I am yours, master."
19926,"If you happen across any other unusual trinkets like this, be sure and bring them to me. I promise it'll be worth the effort."
19927,"In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts."
19928,"Look, if you're heading towards Dawnstar anytime soon, can you give the Jarl this note? Let him know he'll get his lumber."
19929,Falling in love with Gallus was wrong. It was a distraction that allowed the Sepulcher to be desecrated and it likely cost him his life.
19930,I've been a Nightingale for a very long time. I sold my allegiance to Nocturnal in exchange for many profitable years of thieving.
19931,One group has hidden out in Falkreath.
19932,"As many know, there is an ongoing effort to research the work of the Archmagus Shalidor."
19933,Tell Shadr I'm forgetting about his debt.
19934,Despite the far-reaching fame of Alduin's Wall at the time - one of the wonders of the ancient world - its location was lost.
19935,"Camilla, really? You don't have better things to do? Because I could certainly find quite a few tasks..."
19936,"As part of their ""duties,"" the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies all on Nocturnal's behalf."
19938,"Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests."
19941,What do you think you're doing?
19942,Hush now. Think no more of it.
19944,We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you and Eltrys started snooping around.
19945,"I don't know what you overheard, but the Riverwood Trader is still open. Feel free to shop."
19947,"Aye, the bard's got talent, I'll give him that. You just make sure his music is the only thing you're admiring."
19948,No. Indeed not. But beware that your skill does not outstrip your wisdom.
19949,"If you find that sword, traveler, I'd be grateful."
19953,"One of their ceremonies involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so called ""test of worthiness."""
19958,"The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been in Skyrim... well, longer than recorded history."
19960,"Yes sir, of course."
19961,I'll call upon my suppliers this very evening and arrange to double my orders.
19967,I'm running low on Common Soul Gems.
19969,"Ah, yes, I can imagine you'd want to settle that score. Last I heard he was at the Solitude Docks, conducting the Emperor's departure."
19970,What's a man to do if he can't look to his Jarl for help?
19972,Like to see him laugh his way out that.
19974,"Don't fret over the gloom, there's nothing to fear! Old Lurbuk will brighten your spirits -- just lend him your ear!"
19977,"You might try there, if you can get through the Ratway alive."
19978,"They haven't made me a guard, even though I've been asking. So I'll take odd jobs, anything that comes along for now."
19979,"Oh, well. You know. A bit of this, a bit of that."
19982,"So I opened a shop to try and get by. Now, though..."
19983,"Wasn't by choice, I can tell you that."
19985,"Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and nearly any money I make, he drinks away."
19988,"Wasn't by choice, I can tell you that."
19990,"Too bad I haven't had the same success helping this city shed its poverty. Nivenor thinks I'm wasting my time trying, but I disagree."
19992,"Very little money passes through Winterhold anymore, but if there's one thing you can count on, it's folks needing a drink now and then."
19996,(Sounds of unlocking and unbarring a door)
19997,"Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment..."
19998,"A few of us are either too stubborn or too crazy to go, so we do our best to make a living."
20000,Ain't nothing pretty about a corpse. No matter how fresh.
20001,"Suppose it's the same answer, either way. Winterhold's fallen on hard times, to say the least. Most folk packed up and left years ago."
20002,"You mean the inn, or Winterhold?"
20003,"Hmm. I guess that will have to do. You should pass for a real guest, at least until you open your mouth."
20004,Did I see you talking to Sven? Maybe not. Maybe...nevermind. But I would stay away from him if I were you.
20007,Please help me look. He has a bright red beard and hair.
20009,"We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn."
20010,Don't be. We all make mistakes.
20011,"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we?"
20013,"Hello, ladies! Is there anything a big strong man can do for you this fine day?"
20014,Commander Cauis walks around Dragonsreach like a preening rooster. I could do his job blindfolded....
20015,"I assign you Lydia as a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office."
20016,"By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant."
20017,"Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself."
20018,"Between the farm chores, cultivating my supply of nirnroot and keeping a tight rein on my sister Aduri, there's little time for rest."
20019,"He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right, the honor of the Companions demands that we seek it out."
20020,"Ulfric Stormcloak? The rightful High King? That's bordering on treason, man! Stand up. Stand up, I say!"
20022,"I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I guess even my paranoia has its limits."
20024,My pleasure.
20025,"Typical Imperial rot. You speak of Skyrim like you know the land, know its people. You're from Cyrodiil! You know nothing about us! Nothing!"
20026,"A dastardly group, but they're more than simple brigands. Shrewd. Clever. Not to be trifled with."
20032,I've got plenty of good merchandise for you. Take a look.
20033,"Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing."
20035,These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.
20036,"Now go. And give the bride a special kiss, from me."
20037,The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl. It's an honor to serve you.
20041,"The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.  "
20043,Your objective is Fort Neugrad.
20044,She's just worried about you. We all are. We just want you to be happy. We want to make you happy.
20045,The target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
20046,Very well.
20049,Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.
20050,"Nords don't trust magic, or those that use it. Made it difficult for me growing up."
20052,"Keerava has some family at a farm just inside of Morrowind. If you mention you know about it, she might just listen to you."
20053,"Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus."
20054,"The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want."
20056,"Oh, isn't that a shame. And here I am in the Bloodworks."
20058,Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
20059,"You've proven your strength, warrior. Let's avoid any more bloodshed."
20061,You call this a fight?
20062,"Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but I actually believe you."
20064,"You want a real fight, eh?"
20068,"Namira, the Lady of Decay, accepts you for what you are. She has a place for us, where we can sate our appetites without judgment."
20073,"Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless."
20074,Bandits... the worst type of scum.
20076,"Good. I knew that we could count on you. It's simply a beast, but be cautious. The beasts of Skyrim are made of sterner stuff than most."
20078,"Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full strength."
20084,"Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors."
20087,"Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?"
20088,I suggest you learn more on your own. Come back once you've attained some measure of success.
20090,"Few want to be reminded of mortality in a time of war, Kust."
20092,"Just that, I'm afraid. You lack the ability, in any school of magic, to contribute meaningfully to the College's research."
20094,"This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can possibly achieve. In death, he's become a part of that which we use to live."
20095,"Well, well. Look at you. Your kinsmen have turned you into an animal, Nord. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad."
20096,"So, my fellow beast, what do you want? Answers about the Forsworn? Revenge for trying to have you killed?"
20100,"Your freedom? Yes. But even if you were to escape Cidhna Mine, your name would still be stained with all that blood."
20103,"They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with dragons, I gathered it from listening to them talk when they thought I was out."
20104,"She said she'll have it soon. She still has her job at the meadery for now, so she'll be able to pay us."
20105,Aye.
20108,"Plenty of people here that need Eorlund's craftsmanship, my dear. We've never had any reason to deal with those caravans of theirs."
20109,"Are you still working at the Bannered Mare in the evenings, Olfina?"
20110,And why shouldn't I? Just because I'm a Gray-Mane doesn't mean I can't earn my own keep.
20111,I didn't mean... I'm sorry I asked.
20112,"Ah, Ysolda was it? What brings you to the market?"
20113,None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.
20114,"I'm here to buy food, Nazeem. I suppose you don't need to worry about that."
20115,"I'll tell you about the time I was a young girl, barely out of her teens... living on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere."
20117,Did you see a Dog out there?
20118,There's one way to find out. Try to Shout...
20119,I'm so glad you could attend today.
20120,"Ah, well. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it."
20125,"Ah, good. I've been waiting on that."
20128,My father Kleppr is the one you want to talk to. I just clean up.
20129,"I'm busy, and you're bothering me. So go away."
20130,I don't know really.  The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
20132,"I asked the gate guards to look for him. I can't afford to chase him down but could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company."
20135,Ugh...
20137,"Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'd make more money, but I don't like the idea of you traveling alone out there with the war and talk of dragons."
20142,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
20143,Good! There's some gold in it for you if you succeed. Here's the meat - check the road just outside of town.
20145,"A truce? With the Imperials? They'll murder us all, first chance they get."
20148,Is it absolutely necessary for you to bother me right now?
20149,"No, no, this one's alone on the road outside of town. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company."
20150,"Besides, Gray-Mane would never make steel for the Legion."
20151,If you were willing to retrieve him for me I'd give you some fresh meat to attract him out on the road.
20152,"How about a septim? Wait, make that two septims, I feel like living it up."
20154,I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here outsider.
20157,I don't care if she can find a living dwarf -- I can't have her stirring up trouble. We have enough problems as it is.
20159,"You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out."
20160,We were able to figure out the last text you brought in. I thought the least I could do is pass the knowledge along.
20161,It's coming along slowly. I expect there will be some results soon.
20162,I only just got my hands on it. I can only work so quickly.
20165,Will he acknowledge that we Nords deserve to determine our own future? 
20166,"He's been trying to stay out of the war, but it can't last. He's going to have to pick a side. I'm afraid he's going to make the wrong choice."
20167,"You now have the opportunity to maintain your College, and carry on with your lives."
20168,Are you sure you don't want something for them? I may be able to brew you something to help.
20169,Well... fine. I wasn't really gonna do anything with it anyway. Hmph.
20171,Now... Now we see whether my theories are correct.
20174,Kaan...
20175,I apologize if I have not been clear about my work. I didn't want to discuss it for fear this moment might never come.
20176,Everyone knows the dwarves disappeared. No one knows why.
20178,"Under the authority of Mara, the Divine of Love, I declare this couple to be wed."
20179,This little experiment is a first step in recreating the events of their disappearance in an effort to unravel that mystery.
20182,"Lacking the heart of a dead god, I am substituting the crystal you helped craft in its place."
20183,"I also lack Sunder, the counterpart to the dagger Keening. I am reasonably, confident, however, that this will still work."
20184,"Magic is nothing but trouble. If you're set on it, there's that College in Winterhold or Ulfric's court wizard. But don't say I didn't warn you."
20185,"I certainly don't expect it to have quite the same results. I'm no tonal architect, of course!"
20186,"A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died."
20188,"Well, I suppose it's time, isn't it? Let's see what happens. You, uhh... You may want to stand back a step or two."
20189,Let him know that I'll watch out for them. I just want my daughter to be happy.
20192,"Hmm. That... That didn't really do anything, did it?"
20193,Perhaps a little harder?
20195,I don't understand. This should produce some notable effect.
20197,"Work, damn you!"
20198,This fight is pointless.
20199,There's no reason to fight.
20202,I see no reason to fight.
20204,Madanach. I've brought what you asked for.
20205,"Luckily they don't know who he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's parties."
20206,I'm not interested in fighting anymore.
20209,This fight makes no sense.
20210,I see no reason to keep fighting.
20211,"Brrr! Chilly! You'll enjoy this. Not an original part of the Sanctuary, per se. Let's call it a ""forced addition."" Forced by what? Oh, come and see!"
20212,I don't see why someone would actually use them.
20216,Why are we bothering with this?
20217,Why am I fighting?
20218,"If you're heading to the Blue Palace, you might want to rethink that outfit."
20220,Suddenly I don't feel like fighting.
20222,We've got a murderer on the loose...
20223,"Over there, please. Just opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way."
20226,"The inner sanctum lies ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles. Lead on, my friend."
20230,"While the idea seems dubious at best, it has not, at present, been entirely ruled out."
20232,It further suggests that we are somehow then outside our own existence while looking in at it. 
20234,"This would of course mean that Tamriel, indeed all of Mundus, is actually contained within the sphere."
20235,It has been proposed that the object is in fact the entirety of Aurbis in one physical space.
20241,"It has been suggested that the object is a gateway to the realm of Aetherius, but nothing has proven that idea one way or the other."
20242,"At this time, there is no indication that, as has been rumored, the object is in fact a physical part of Magnus, the god of magic."
20243,"Get away from me, you Skyrim trash."
20244,Any and all theories are currently being considered. Those with ideas should please speak with Mirabelle.
20245,"He committed atrocities so infamous they are still remembered, thousands of years later."
20248,Of course. But why not let her go in first?
20249,"Work continues on the Eye of Magnus, as it has been commonly referred to."
20250,"Ni liivrah hin moro. True, this is not the final krongrah - victory. But not even the heroes of old were able to defeat Alduin in open battle."
20251,Projects are underway to discern the origin and nature of the College's recent find in Saarthal.
20252,I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
20253,"As of yet, there has been no sign of them."
20255,Any information as to the whereabouts of the previous group of Apprentices would be greatly appreciated.
20256,"Yeah, you said that yesterday."
20257,"This goes quite against College policy, and the party responsible is advised to cease these actions at once."
20259,"He has suggested that, should he find out who is responsible, he is well versed in making things disappear permanently."
20261,"Only this. You have the Thu'um of a dovah, but without the wings of one, you will never set foot in Skuldafn."
20263,"No more experiments are to be carried out there, and mages are advised that you enter the Midden at your own risk."
20264,"The Midden remains off-limits at this time; while the initial outbreak has been cleaned up, the area is still considered hazardous."
20266,We've had yet another sprained ankle due to soul gems being left on the floor. Let's please try and keep injuries to a minimum.
20270,"Once again, I must ask that everyone please clean up any materials used in the common areas."
20271,"You here from the city? I visit Whiterun from time to time, mostly to make deals."
20272,"Failure to do so will result in paying, in Urag's words, ""a blood price."" I did not ask him to elaborate on that point."
20273,"If this is impossible due to misuse or accident, Urag recommends finding a replacement copy to deliver to the Arcanaeum."
20274,"Your payment waits for you at a dead drop. It is inside an urn, in the very chamber where we first met, in Volunruud."
20275,"Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled down into a ingestible liquid."
20278,"Atronachs have a tendency to frighten the locals. Undead.... well, I don't even think it needs to be said."
20279,Please refrain from practicing Conjuration spells in view of the town of Winterhold.
20280,"At this time, I would like to make a few statements regarding policy here at the College."
20282,"I've been instructed to tell all visitors that the Lady Elisif isn't feeling well. She wishes you a good day, and please call again another time."
20284,"Khajiit are not welcome in the cities, so we make our camps outside the walls."
20288,Increased his intelligence and knowledge in ways unfathomable to us? We may never know for certain.
20290,Is it possible that it somehow contributed to his work? Perhaps allowed him to life multiple lifetimes in a short span of time?
20291,"What, then, of this Glamoril? It means ""secret of life"" in elvish. Could this be an explanation for Shalidor's works?"
20292,You... you're in charge here until I can sort this all out.
20293,"An array so great, in fact, that it remains a source of curiosity."
20294,"What is interesting is that it appears he was also incredibly prolific, writing on a diverse array of subjects."
20297,Used to be twice as many miners working here before all this trouble started.
20298,I can but hone their skills and harden their hearts. The rest is up to the gods.
20299,Hear me!
20303,"As his housecarl, Igmund's security is my chief concern."
20305,So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just... the Night Mother's body?
20306,Your job is to get into the party without being fingered as a spy. I'll take care of the rest.
20307,What's the matter? You can't stand the sight of a strong Nord woman?
20309,"While stories have persisted since the First Era, none have ever confirmed the existence of this ""Glamoril"" or its purpose or function."
20311,To Oblivion with you.
20312,"Listen, lass. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective."
20313,"If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do."
20316,Very well.
20317,"Every mage in this College regularly uses wards for practice, so as to avoid physical harm."
20318,Come closer!
20319,"But more importantly, wards have saved lives. This is a simple fact."
20322,"I submit that everyone in this College has, at one time or another, relied on one of the Restoration spells that can keep them at bay."
20323,"Firstly, the ability to repel the undead cannot be ignored."
20324,"Now, now my dear. I'm talking about academia, not politics."
20325,Before the ancient flame...
20326,"Oh, and when would that be, I wonder? When I sell my land to the Silver-Bloods?"
20327,"I would just like to remind everyone, once again, that Restoration is indeed a valid school of magic."
20328,Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!
20330,Say as little as possible so as to avoid compromising our neutral position.
20332,"No, no... Maramal... we talked about this. Talen..."
20333,Let me just take this coin purse off your hands for you. And those nice boots you've got there.
20337,"Arch-Mage Aren believed that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur."
20338,Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this chamber. Your choice.
20339,"Arch-Mage Aren believes that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur."
20340,The Thalmor are paranoid and thorough. You won't get in the front door with anything but the clothes on your back.
20341,"Twilight watch over you, guardian."
20346,"But that's what we promised Ulfric and his men. It seems foolish looking back, but at the time we were hoping the Elves wouldn't find out."
20347,I bet you are. Which one do you want?
20349,You should talk to Anton if you need anything. He's the master chef.
20350,"In truth? It was so easy, I feel a bit guilty. Once again, the sweet, innocent child earned more trust than was wise."
20351,That's a quick way to the executioner's block.
20352,Thus they may claim that the Synod is indeed a political minority in the Empire and should be treated as such.
20356,The College of Whispers hopes to learn that our College also supports these avenues of research.
20357,Weak. He's weak. You're strong. Crush him.
20358,...should have known she was lying... said she'd wait for me... but they never wait...
20359,"Bashnag's circle of mages. We - well ""they"" live here. They made it pretty clear that I'm no longer welcome."
20360,Kodlak is the one who figures out who can be a Companion. So talk to him. It's out of my hands.
20361,I'll speak with Aela about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
20363,"I had retained Enthir's services in, uhh, acquiring something specific."
20364,"Please, cut me down!"
20365,"Aren believed that although the initial communications were innocent enough, they were sent with a particular motive in mind."
20366,The College of Winterhold has thus far declined requests for direct meetings. This has been at the specific request of Arch-Mage Aren.
20368,It is no secret that both the Synod and the College of Whispers have recently made inquiries as to the status of our College here in Winterhold.
20374,"Death? Oh, there's death to be found here, to be sure."
20375,The age of the stones themselves has yet to be officially determined. It has been widely assumed that they were placed during the Merethic Era.
20376,"Also, their placement throughout Skyrim does not correspond to any known magical phenomenon."
20378,"One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in your kinsmen's blood. Best you not be there on that day, Nord."
20380,Kyne's guardian troll awaits you. Complete this trial and you'll have proven yourself a true hunter.
20381,Gerdur... 
20383,"None, however, exactly match the markings or distribution of Skyrim's stones."
20384,You cannot escape!
20385,The prevailing opinion of Skyrim natives is that the stones are indeed magical in nature.
20388,"But you can hear me, obviously. Something still isn't quite right. At least I'm making progress."
20391,"We're not done talking. You fell for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - didn't you? I won't let her have you!"
20392,"The Thalmor would need to make an example of me... I'd be thrown into prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations."
20394,"However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold, and who owns at least one piece of property in my city."
20397,I wanted to thank you again for the mince pie you sent over. It was delicious.
20399,Absolutely.
20402,It would ruin me.
20406,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
20407,"Oh, just one apple, Carlotta? Just one tiny apple. I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear it."
20408,"I've a mine to run, so if you'll excuse me..."
20410,"It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men."
20411,"Never. They've shut us down forever, Enmon. The Divines have abandoned us."
20412,I believe I'll stay here and bask in Eldergleam's warmth a bit longer.
20413,"Dibella, guide us."
20414,"It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men."
20415,"They're taking it by wagon to Windhelm. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far."
20417,I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon loaded with silver isn't good enough for you?
20421,Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?
20422,Would you now?
20423,Well I...
20426,"But you don't, do you?"
20428,You've bested me!
20431,"Such a fine day, smell the air! Isn't it wonderful?"
20434,Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?
20435,"I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?"
20436,But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
20437,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
20438,Well I...
20442,"Please, help yourself to more wine."
20443,"According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do."
20446,"Oh, no. I won't tell you anything more until we have an agreement."
20448,This is my treasure!
20450,"Woman, there's a vein of malachite as thick as my leg back there."
20451,"When a new government takes charge, records can be lost, taxes can be forgotten and laws aren't always enforced."
20453,I wish to speak to Karliah for the moment.
20454,"As for you, General Tullius, I see now that Galmar was right. Talking to the Empire is just as useless as ever."
20455,"Nocturnal, save me..."
20456,New sister. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
20459,He just wants you to follow in his footsteps.
20460,"And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!"
20461,What the...I'm invisible!
20463,Become one with the Evergloam!
20464,"With my lock picking aptitude, I was a natural at jailbreaking... made a great deal of gold doing it too."
20466,Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.
20468,Very well.
20471,I have eternity to find you.
20473,"He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed."
20474,A stirring in the dark?
20476,"In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do."
20477,"And let's not forget her crew - loyal and bloodthirsty, the lot of them."
20478,"Yes, yes. Let's see what we have..."
20480,"Oh, and there's a nasty feud between two families called the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns. You'll want to be careful there."
20482,"The games have ended, time to face your death!"
20483,The shadows have betrayed you!
20484,"You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise."
20485,I don't expect you to be capable of even that.
20486,Defend the Ebonmere! Kill the mortal!
20487,"This isn't an order of cowards. I'll find someone more agreeable, I'm sure."
20488,"You've breathed your last breath, mortal!"
20490,Let the darkness rip you asunder!
20493,Father!
20494,Defend the Sepulcher at all costs!
20495,"Don't get me wrong, he could scam a beggar out of his last septim... but he's no mastermind."
20496,"Make your peace, mortal!"
20497,"Gods bless you, healer."
20499,"""As Talos is my witness, may this oath bind me to death and beyond..."""
20500,"They were interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College allows, so they were... persuaded to leave."
20502,Perhaps it was nothing...
20503,Travel safely. It's dangerous out there.
20504,"Thank you. He can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your help."
20505,Hmmf. Maybe you're the one talking to him then...
20506,"Hagraven or horker, it matters not. We've got the arrows to fell any game."
20507,Another soul claimed for Lady Nocturnal!
20512,I'd love get one of those Imperial weasels under my boot...
20513,The intruder has vanished.
20514,Let me give you a bit of advice.
20515,"You stupid lizard! I said give me some more drink, or I'll have your head on a pike!"
20516,"Together we're going to stop these dragons, if we have to put every last one of them back in the ground."
20517,But I can't turn away a potential ally in these times. Let's see if you're better than a common mercenary.
20518,They say the Dragonborn can Shout without any training. Like Talos himself...
20519,"Helgird's taken the body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies."
20521,"""Fair"" is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this."
20522,The shadows have failed you!
20523,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
20524,"I swear, is there no end to these uncouth savages, just throwing their trash wherever they please..."
20525,"Hold on, now, we only want to..."
20526,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
20527,"Another girl killed. This is Susanna, from Candlehearth Hall. "
20528,Not sure. Feeling like taking another trip.
20529,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
20532,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
20533,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
20534,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
20535,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
20537,What do you want?
20539,It was nice to finally meet someone out here who doesn't want to rob you or take off your head.
20540,"I don't know if they were right to execute him for what he did, but I'll tell you something..."
20543,That's her! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill her!
20546,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
20548,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
20550,"Say, that's not a bad idea. You look like you could handle yourself against these beasts."
20552,Haven't I always been a good father? A good chief?
20553,He is the God of Mercy. The patron of order and justice for all of Tamriel.
20558,This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't compromise my position in any way?
20559,Damn dustmen! Why don't you stay dead?
20560,The snowberries up in Winterhold have lowered themselves to ask for our help.
20564,"Need a horse? Talk to my father, Skulvar."
20565,I thought the the Gray Quarter would be a haven for my kind. I was wrong.
20566,Submit to Her will!
20567,Shadows fall!
20568,You see what talking to them gets us?
20570,Sure am! I thank my lucky stars every time I look to the night sky that Maven took me in and gave me this opportunity.
20571,Shadows take you!
20572,"They weren't gone somewhere for all these years. They were dead, killed off centuries ago by my predecessors."
20575,"You will need stealth and lies to get past her guards. You will assassinate her swiftly and quietly. And if combat finds you, survive the escape."
20576,"Now some worry this wizard, Falion, will foul it all up."
20577,"We've made a bit of gold. Here, love, this is your share."
20579,"There's more enchanting to be done. You can acquire whatever it is and bring it back here, and I'll take care of it."
20580,"*Gasp* Finally, someone came!... I..."
20583,"Gee, thanks for the help."
20584,You're making a mistake!
20585,It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the College. Truly comforting.
20586,Can I help you?
20589,I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done.
20590,"I am Hermaeus Mora. I am the guardian of the unseen, and knower of the unknown. I have been watching you, mortal."
20591,"I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we Nightingales need to stick together, eh?"
20592,Get me down. Get me down!
20593,"So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's as if the very stars have finally aligned."
20594,"No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it."
20595,"What do I pay you for, to stand around all day? You're supposed to be bringing goods to the store."
20597,Just north of Windhelm. There's a hollowed-out rock. I have some things hidden in there. Take them! They're yours.
20598,I wonder who will replace him in the Circle?
20601,Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those plans behind unless he had his reasons.
20604,"I anticipated the problem. While you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky Haven Temple."
20609,Didn't take long for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.
20610,"There's some trouble in Haafingar. The Legion's too busy with the war, and they're hiring us to take care of their problems."
20611,"Hey, you approached me. You want to play coward, that's your problem."
20613,My clan's shield. So Lenne really did stumble into that cave and was eaten by monsters.
20616,I would be fine if they didn't.  Have you seen their eyes? They don't have any! Gross.
20618,"As a token of my esteem, I have instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase property in the city."
20619,"I, uhh... wait, what?"
20621,"We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone that looks crooked at him."
20622,I'll meet you over there.
20623,Probably.
20626,"Come mortal, let's end this here and now!"
20627,"But never mind that, you did the job and you did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from... if you think you can handle it."
20630,Torolf!
20632,"He now serves us honorably as Thane, and to the great benefit of the hold, I now serve as Jarl."
20633,Hunh!
20634,Yeah!
20636,"Speak to me, Shield-Sister."
20637,"Were the Stormcloaks to prevail in dismantling Imperial rule in Skyrim, who would be her protector? No. We will crush this rebellion. We must do."
20638,"Yes! It's not perfect, but it's a close enough approximation that it should certianly suffice for initial tests!"
20643,That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.
20644,There's some trouble in Eastmarch. Farmers getting troubled by some bad types who've built up a stronghold in the area.
20645,We are leaving?
20646,"I'm still waiting for those notes, if you can get them."
20647,"And then, the tragedy with Hroggar's home."
20648,"I'm so angry, I can hardly stand it!"
20649,"I heard Valdr made it back safe. Too bad about the others, but at least it's one less thing to worry about."
20654,It's all up to you now... Listener.
20656,And it was only later that it was realized that this individual might... misuse such a staff.
20658,Wait... who in blazes is this?
20661,Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?
20663,It's too late for that. Leave me. Save yourself.
20664,"Come on. Give me your hand, I'm getting you out of here."
20667,"Oh, really? So that Dark Elf took my ring. So typical of his kind."
20668,But it's hard to believe that even Balgruuf would choose Elisif over Ulfric.
20669,"Yes, father. Which cask should we open?"
20671,You can't hide from me!
20673,Now let's keep moving.
20674,Give me... just a moment...
20680,We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
20683,Did you hear? The Riverwood Trader was robbed! Poor Lucan must be torn to pieces over it.
20685,"I... I'm impressed with your initiative. Of course, someone will need to follow up on this."
20686,"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Windhelm. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
20687,"How do you do, thane?"
20690,The Jarl has advised me not to talk about which court attendants I'd like to punch in the face. More's the pity.
20692,I suppose she's Jarl Elisif now. She married High King Torygg just before Ulfric killed him. The Empire supports her claim to be High Queen.
20697,Our stock of arrows is running a bit low.
20698,Not here. The Underforge. Come on.
20699,Thank you. Thank you! Azura's Prophecy always guide you to fortune.
20700,We're marching on Movarth's Lair whether you come with us or not.
20701,"Don't tell me you, of all people, are afraid of a battle."
20704,"Ulfric called him out as a traitor to Skyrim, and killed him in single combat."
20705,"Some say murdered, but it was a lawful challenge in the old way."
20706,We've got trouble right here in Whiterun Hold. Nothing we can't handle.
20708,It was nice to spend time with someone who enjoys archery as much as I do.
20710,"No, I openly welcome the presence of armed strangers who have no reason to care about any of us."
20714,"Bye now, mister."
20715,"We are turning the city over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man."
20716,Keep your eyes and ears open.
20719,Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one through.
20724,Fresh food. No wood rot on the furniture. Someone's been here. Recently.
20729,"If the forest wasn't so dangerous, I'd spend every spare moment riding."
20730,Pah. The gods have a place for killers. You can't carry the burden? You're weak.
20732,Liar.
20736,Now you're coming with us. It's a life sentence in Cidhna Mine for you.
20737,"I'm sending you to clear out Fort Hraagstad. If you survive, you'll pass."
20741,You think you're the only one who knows that? We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you showed up.
20747,Don't you Nords put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the Moot chose the king. 
20749,So I'm told. Try and keep up.
20755,The only thing Madanach expects is a bottle of Skooma in tribute every so often. You're not getting through.
20756,I can take you!
20757,"If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?"
20758,It would seem so.
20759,How's the forge today?
20763,That's what I was hoping you'd say.
20764,Really? How nice.
20765,Listen. All of you!
20769,You promised me you'd sweep the entranceway.
20770,That's right. Turn around and leave.
20773,Anything else?
20774,Death to the Nords!
20775,"A likely story. They won't even do their own dirty work now, eh? Well, you won't get the better of me!"
20776,"Go fiddling with any locks around here, we're going to have a real problem."
20778,Old Delvin kept calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's on us.
20779,"Mercer may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny."
20781,Back off!
20783,"Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense."
20784,"Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercer's blood on my blade than spend the rest of my life regretting that I ran the other way."
20786,Have you ever been to Darkwater Crossing? Terrible name for such a beautiful place.
20787,Be careful. We need to find out what happened here.
20789,"I'm telling you, I don't... wait, what's this ring? This isn't mine!"
20791,"If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now I think our chances have improved."
20794,"Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll."
20795,"With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts."
20797,"Don't take offense to the nicknames, morsel. I'm a werewolf. Hard not to think of you as a snack."
20798,"In order for us to receive our abilities... our end of the bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned."
20800,Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace?
20801,You planning on using that weapon?
20803,I have no doubt that we still hold her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat Mercer Frey.
20804,One group has hidden out in Hjaalmarch.
20805,"If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me... with any of us, she wouldn't have answered my call."
20806,"Kill these casters as fast as you can, otherwise they may summon creatures we don't want to deal with."
20807,"Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well."
20809,"Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. At your service."
20811,"In my day, we knew how to dispose of trash properly."
20813,You'll find that this place offers many things that will help you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to learn.
20817,"Well, the giants took care of him, and you took care of the giants. Two problems solved at once."
20818,"It's going to happen soon, I just know it. We'll strike something better than iron. Silver, or maybe even gold. You'll see."
20819,"Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your home."
20822,The only way this place will ever return to its glory days is if we can finish these extra jobs and start the gold flowing again.
20824,I can still put up a fight!
20827,"Speak with the Desperate Gambler at the Barracks, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
20829,"By doin' these extra jobs and puttin' some fear into the people, we can take back the cities and start bein' taken seriously once again."
20831,"It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute."
20832,We can't take another villager from the surface so soon. I told you to prepare everything properly!
20834,"Years ago, the Guild used to have a foothold in every major city in Skyrim. You wouldn't dare even lift an apple without checkin' with us."
20835,The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our latest applicant.
20836,"Shouldn't you be helping me then, wife of mine? Sharing my problems? Being my better half?"
20837,"Windhelm's a bit cold for my tastes. And I ain't talking about the weather. You're not from Windhelm, are you?"
20838,"On threat of what, exactly? This city wouldn't run without me! Now if you'll excuse me, my work awaits."
20840,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
20841,"Thanks to Maven Black-Briar, we still have some pull in Riften. But get arrested in Whiterun and you'll be tossed right into the prisons."
20842,Speak with Urag in the Arcanaeum. See if he is aware of anything that matches your discovery.
20843,It would be my pleasure.
20844,"The Jarl has put out a bounty to slay a giant. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
20845,Hold your fire until he's close!
20847,Tomorrow. Same time as before.
20849,"Best of all, we'd have enough gold to throw around so we can start living in the lap of luxury again."
20850,"If we can make a name for ourselves in Skyrim once again, I can almost promise you those merchants would return."
20851,But I've no doubt he'll prove loyal to the Empire in the end. He's no traitor.
20853,A war dog is good company and good protection.
20854,"Father, how old were you when you left home?"
20857,"Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon... she'll set you up with your new armor."
20858,"I'm sorry, but I think you've had enough for the moment."
20860,"Karliah has provided me with the means to be rid of you, and this ancient tomb becomes your final resting place."
20862,"I'm here to assist anyone interested in joining the College. Also, my presence tends to frighten the locals and keep them away."
20864,Live long. Fight well.
20865,"Oh, if I had my full power, granting that would be trivial."
20866,"Oh, great. I'm gonna get killed by a crazy wizard..."
20868,The finest jewelry in all of Markarth.
20870,That's the wrong answer.
20874,"The waves receded in time, but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned what was left of the city."
20875,"We are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars! "
20876,Already taken care of.
20878,Alva? Didn't think she had it in her.
20879,"Winterhold was ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire districts of the city were lost overnight."
20880,These damn bears are driving me crazy!
20881,"You want to give me money? Just like that? Fine, but I intend to earn that investment. I don't need handouts."
20882,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
20887,"Oh, very well. Probably safest that way."
20888,The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot and yet I used it on you.
20889,Be careful.
20890,"As for research... Well, a sufficient explanation will cover almost anything."
20891,Purposely killing your fellow College members is a bad idea. I'd advise against it. Theft and assault can get you into trouble as well.
20892,Haven't attacked each other yet. Good a sign as any.
20893,My time has come. I am old. Too old to become chief. It would be wrong for me to take wives at this age. So I will die.
20897,"Just promise me when you get some more in, I'll have the first crack at them."
20898,"Another soul for you, Father!"
20899,What?
20900,Get over to Dawnstar. We're mounting our final attack!
20902,Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire... a nightmarish land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways.
20904,"Put on some clothes, you damned fool."
20906,"Farewell, sir."
20907,I still can't believe Isabella's gone. She was such a helpful young lass.
20909,It would explain what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I thought I must have just been seeing things...
20911,"You are interfering in Imperial business. Yeah, so you'll have to pay us a fine... of say, 100 gold. Pay up, citizen."
20912,"But look... if you need work, Hod can always use help at the mill."
20914,I'm sorry to turn you away. I hope you understand.
20916,"Things just go from bad to worse. First the war, now dragons... what's this world coming to?"
20917,Ysmir's beard! You're one after my own heart. I would love another bottle.
20918,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
20927,There's something you could do for me. For all of us here.
20928,It's a long way to the next city if you change your mind.
20930,"Well, looks like you completed the contract as directed. Finally. A little sloppy, but, well... done is done."
20933,"Come on in. We got warm food, warm drinks, and warm beds."
20937,"I swear, if those things have laid a hand on her..."
20938,"I don't know about such things, but I heard the Greybeards summon you. That's good enough for me."
20939,True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's. 
20940,"Well, I've heard awful stories about these Thalmor, and how they're rounding up everyone who still worships Talos."
20941,"Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin."
20942,"Come on in. Let me know if you need anything, or take a seat by the fire and I'll send someone over."
20944,Galmar thinks we should double our men in the Reach.
20945,"Pactur and I, we make sure the miners aren't stealing, and that the ore makes it to Solitude."
20947,"Riften remains allied to the Stormcloak cause, under the authority of Jarl Laila Law-Giver."
20948,"Hold it. This here's a toll road, see? Yer gonna have to hand over, say, 200 gold if you want to use our road."
20949,Come on in. The Silver-Blood Inn has plenty of strong drink and clean rooms.
20950,"Finally, someone comes in. Kick off your boots, stay awhile. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with. I got nothing but time these days."
20951,"Hmph. Don't say much, but there's a strange aura about you. You walk in the shadow of death..."
20952,"Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?"
20955,"Do not raise arms against my people, and you shall always have a place here, Champion of Malacath."
20956,"Welcome to the Vilemyr Inn. If there's anything I can get you, just let me know."
20957,"When I am become wolf, I am treachery incarnate. And then, then... there is no one who can stand between the hunter and his prey."
20958,There's nothing else to discuss. Use the North Gate if you want to enter Riften.
20960,I know you for what you are. This town's blood is ours. Leave it! Now we must return to our roles lest the sheep suspect the wolves.
20961,"Frabbi, a customer needs a drink!"
20962,"Here, let me get you some mead. This one's on me."
20965,"That remains to be seen. By rights, she has a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim."
20966,"Hey, Talen... get off your lazy tail and take care of the customer!"
20968,"Lynly, would you mind taking care of the customer please?"
20969,We cannot fight the foe in this mist!
20970,"Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came ""this"" close to turning that priest inside out. Damned messy."
20971,I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.
20973,Perhaps some other time.
20974,"My family's weathered its share of problems, but we don't dwell on the past."
20975,"Yes, mum!"
20977,Too lazy to give him a drink yourself? Oaf.
20978,How do you know of me?
20979,Keep your scales on.
20980,You were not invited here. You are not welcome here.
20981,Another quiet day... I hope.
20984,Yes!
20986,Yes!
20987,Agreed. We all stay together.
20988,Is there somewhere we can talk? There's no telling when the news from Helgen will reach the Imperials...
20989,Blades to kill your prey and your rivals.
20990,Yes!
20991,You bend to me?
20993,"That's all I can do, you idiot. What are you waiting for?"
20994,"Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them."
20997,Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever.
20999,Not even for a look. 
21001,"Ah, freedom. Now get out of my way. I have a task to attend to."
21005,"Unless you're bringin' me another round, you can just keep walking."
21006,Yamarz was a coward and a weakling. His deceitful ways have cost you all greatly.
21008,Mey...Gut!
21009,"Follow me, it's this way."
21013,"I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours."
21015,"Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers."
21017,"Sure, you make your retreat and I'll make mine."
21018,"Cut me loose, minion of the Hated One. I need to get to Markarth."
21020,"Your blood, Dragonborn."
21022,"I'd rather not talk about my daughter, if you'll excuse me."
21024,Must be new around here.
21025,So. The King of Corruption sends his messenger to challenge me. Very well.
21029,"Aye, a whole heap of it. You see that Temple? Way up there?"
21032,May the spirit of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know the beloved serenity of Aetherius...
21033,You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?
21035,The new guards are often too busy learning their responsibilities to notice a few smuggled goods or minor robberies.
21036,Fine. I won't ask questions. Cut me loose.
21038,Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue.
21044,"Reason, reason, reason. Your kind and their reasons."
21049,I'll gut you like a horker!
21050,Pathetic excuse for an elf...
21051,"Flee from my sight, Dunmer, or I'll have you shipped back to Vvardenfell in a crate."
21052,How could you just leave me here?
21053,"Slink away now, little Khajiit, with your tail between your legs."
21054,I could use a hand here.
21058,Watch yourself out there. The mercenaries Aringoth hired are trained killers. Just ask our poor little Vex.
21059,What's the situation?
21060,Careful with that fire.
21063,"I don't like to brag, but I once took down a bear at three hundred yards. In a blizzard."
21066,"Yes, I hope this helps you."
21067,"Yeah, yeah. Go on in."
21068,"Filthy Nord. In time, your entire race will be eradicated."
21070,Go now. Return to your pathetic pursuits.
21074,"Thank you! We'll head back to work, right away. Take this, it's the least I can do."
21075,"Then when you have the ring, you pickpocket Brand-Shei and leave it behind."
21076,You drove them off? By yourself?
21078,My experimentation involves a magical construct and a reagent that will allow the construct to maintain a field of permanent harmonic energy!
21079,"The title of Thane is an honor, a gift for your service. Guards will know to look the other way, if you tell them who you are."
21080,"Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family. And, we've always welcomed those... shunned by society."
21081,The Jarl has recognized you as a person of great importance in the hold. A hero.
21083,"I'll do anything if it means saving my brother. You'll join us, won't you?"
21084,"Shor's Stone - pissant little town, not even an inn. Just a bunch of miners scratching in the dirt."
21088,You have heard of the Gourmet?
21092,"Very well, the conditions are acceptable. You may proceed."
21095,What dangers and wonders shall we discover in the frozen wastes? I can hardly wait to find out!
21096,"Men, women, children, no one was spared my wrath. I destroyed whole villages."
21098,This is Karthwasten. Mining town. I hear they've had a lot of trouble with the Forsworn.
21099,Remember when that used to be the Honningbrew Meadery? Didn't stand a chance against those Black-Briars of Riften.
21104,"Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place. I fear for the security of the very land if it should break free."
21107,Any warrior that gets to be old is either fearsome or a coward. I'll let you find out which Skjor is.
21112,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
21114,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
21115,I hear you put Laelette out of her misery. 
21116,"What?! No, that's not me. I'm not Esbern. I don't know what you're talking about."
21118,You should probably just take this directly to Faleen. Wouldn't want the old icebrain stumbling over the words.
21119,Sondas takes care of me when mom's not around.
21120,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
21123,"Lead, then. You have my steel."
21124,"Stop, thief!"
21126,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
21131,"I dared speak of the Empire and the lies that have been spread by Ulfric, the leader of the Stormcloaks."
21137,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
21138,"He fought on the wrong side, and he paid for it. That's all I have to say."
21139,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
21141,"A prospective student, are you? Well, I'm afraid I'm not much good at teaching. You should try your luck at the College of Winterhold."
21142,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
21143,The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground.
21144,I knew I heard something!
21145,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
21148,I've a lot of respect for the Restoration School. Skyrim could use more healers.
21149,"I'm originally from Cyrodiil, but I left there after I had a falling out with my family."
21150,"The house I mentioned earlier is still available, if you want to buy it."
21152,"Tell me, son. Any truth to these stories I been hearing. About you gluing a cow's udders shut? You really do something like that?"
21153,The only grownups who talk to me are the kind I don't want talking to me.
21154,"If you want to be a master pickpocket like me, I can get you there."
21156,"In my days as a riverboat captain, I was known to run a tight ship."
21161,"The men training here in Solitude and the troops out in the field, they all need weapons and armor."
21162,Ah! Picking on an old man? What did I ever do to you?
21167,"Lisette's a fine lass, but when I join the Legion, she's not the type to wait for my return."
21168,"Thank you, marsh-friend."
21173,"Mortals call it Dawnbreaker, for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life."
21177,Hope they don't get carried away here.
21181,"So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads. Hmm?"
21184,Now what's going on?!
21186,Ice-Veins.
21187,"Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss."
21189,"You've done excellent work here. Truly excellent. There's only one thing missing now, and that should be arriving shortly."
21196,"Look, it ain't my business ta tell the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the Elder Council, you'd better belie-"
21198,"This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery."
21202,"Here we are. Solitude. Safe and sound, as always."
21203,Did you know Viola Giordano wanted to put one of them on my front door?
21208,"Come on, show yourself!"
21210,"Oh. Well, thanks for trying I suppose. I'll just have to come up with the coin somehow."
21212,That iron sword's pretty undependable. You should try steel.
21213,"He... thanked us for contacting him, but said they didn't need any more lumber at the moment."
21215,This is not just a dagger!
21216,"The last time I checked, gold coins aren't falling from the heavens. You better take some jobs if you want to earn your share."
21217,Rargh!
21218,"Keening, one of the great tools of Kagrenac himself, is finally in my possession. I don't think I really believed this day would come."
21219,Are you finished ogling the grotesque? I suppose I should be grateful you didn't simply attack me.
21220,"Mine? Oh no, the stone is yours. I simply need to borrow it a moment..."
21222,"I don't know, you don't look so impressive to me. I mean, you're no Gray Fox, but you must be doing something right."
21223,A group of werewolf hunters who have gotten wise to our little secret.
21224,I think she's sitting by the fire. Poor girl.
21225,You still have one of the witch's heads. This is good.
21227,"I guess you don't hear too well. I never heard of this ""friend"" of yours."
21228,I need only look for a few moments...
21229,"Ahh, yes. I see it now."
21230,"I've been following him for months now. Well, not actually following. Trying to find him."
21231,I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would lower it in a hurry.
21234,I didn't mean nothing by it! Just... leave me alone! What do you want?
21235,"I have the knowledge I need. And so you may have your stone back, and also please take this."
21239,I think it only fitting that the Arch-Mage personally receive a large portion of the reward. Well done.
21240,Good. One less worry for my people.
21246,"How do you do it, Valindor? How do you work at Black-Briar Meadery and the Fishery without getting exhausted?"
21251,All of that blacksmithing... It's not good for a little girl. Ain't... ladylike.
21253,The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive. No one was expecting it. Monstrous waves battered the shore for weeks on end.
21254,"She's bribed countless officials, has friends back in the Imperial City and freely associates with the Thieves Guild."
21255,Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than the Imperials could.
21256,"Consider this an extremely risky job but with a massive potential for profit, and you'll do fine."
21259,I guess I expected too much from you.
21260,So sad what happened to young Elisif. Tragic really. Such a young and pretty girl.
21262,I feel like we're mining even more ore than before.
21264,Keep an eye out for Imperials. They still hold this entire region. As long as we don't do anything stupid... we should be all right.
21265,Justice can be harsh. But it is still justice. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
21266,Give Vex a kiss for me.
21267,"Here you stand, talking to a married woman. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind."
21269,Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up.
21270,"No pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!"
21273,"What is it now, Viola?"
21274,Alduin mahlaan
21277,I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this.
21279,"Save him. Let him perform his rites one more time. And when he does, I will be waiting for him."
21280,But Boethiah's priest is imprisoned as well. But not by me. He is hurt. Suffering.
21281,It's an old family. Very well-respected throughout the Reach.
21282,Fine. I offered you a reward. You'll get the freedom your kind enjoys so much.
21284,"I'm under a lot of pressure. If you don't leave me alone, I won't be held responsible."
21285,I'll be sure to put in a good word if I get to Windhelm ahead of you.
21287,"And Dawnstar is known for its bad luck. We're the last port of call before Windhelm, and the ore we trade makes rich targets for pirates."
21288,Damn right. You don't have to be a Nord to fight for Skyrim's freedom.
21290,Archers. Behind those windows!
21294,"Karliah is the thief responsible for murdering the previous Guild Master, Gallus. Now she's after Mercer."
21295,"No, she certainly wouldn't. And... for whatever reason, she chose to relay Motierre's information to you."
21297,"In the old tales, Nord heroes would use the power of their Voice to Shout down the gates of cities and strike down their enemies."
21298,"We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know."
21299,"I spill just a bit of metal, and Mulush takes it out of my hide."
21300,I can't believe we lost Whiterun. The rebels have a great advantage in controlling the center now. We must take it back!
21301,Eh... You see... I've been thinking about Faleen quite a bit. You know Faleen?
21307,"Oh... yes. Now that you mention it, I think... sorry about that."
21308,"I am Burguk's mother and wise woman to our tribe, outlander."
21309,Dear. You should put that weapon away.
21310,"But I know that after you think about what you saw today, you'll realize that Skyrim deserves to be free."
21311,"Go in quiet, break our man out, then get out of there. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell."
21315,No way to know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here.
21316,Fool! None may know my secret!
21317,"If it's about the mine, I'm all ears."
21319,"It's tough, just scraping by out here. But I make do."
21320,"You're different, aren't you? Not like anyone else. Not in Morthal, or Skyrim."
21321,"Look at her, rummaging through refuse. Wonder what she's lost... besides her mind."
21324,"I'm just a poor old woman, dear. No need to trouble yourself with me."
21328,Of course they have! I've made no secret of my loyalty to the Empire. I'm no coward.
21329,This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.
21330,"I'm sorry to always be so hard on you, boy. I just worry I don't have much time left."
21332,"To activate this strange power, one must only speak the magic words, which are..."
21335,"See you on the other side, mortal."
21336,Dunno. One of these corpses. Does it matter?
21337,Mauhulakh was such a darling boy. Until he got older and started having opinions.
21338,Thank you. I appreciate your assistance.
21342,As you wish.
21343,Good job. I knew you'd come back with something for me.
21344,"Uhhh... (coughing, wheezing) ... ahhhh..."
21347,Fire!
21348,"There's a sentry patrolling the area. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word."
21349,"There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word."
21351,It seems I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
21355,"Both of you... out, out!"
21356,There's no escape!
21359,I was just getting settled in. Where are we going?
21361,"We've lost more clients in the last decade than I'd care to count, but Maven's stuck with us through throughout the entire ordeal."
21362,Go to Solitude. Stalk the Jarl and slay her.
21364,"I've consulted my contacts regarding the information you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that symbol."
21365,"Look at you! Betcha think you're something, huh?"
21366,"It's hard to recover from something like the Great Collapse, but I believe Winterhold can do it."
21367,"So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that."
21368,But we should be done with murders in the Blue Palace. I've stepped up security around here.
21370,And the Underforge taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves.
21371,"But I'll be ready when a new leader takes up the cause. As sure as ice is cold and stone is hard, I'll be ready."
21372,"Oh, now, that can't be good..."
21374,"Here, here. For your troubles! Shiny, clinky gold! A few coins for a kind deed! And thank you! Thank you again."
21376,"Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?"
21377,"Sharp, aren't they? This was the last thing many saw before they were sacrificed in my name."
21378,Is it cold in here? I should put more wood on the fire...
21380,"It's going very well, actually. The war hasn't even slowed down our production or shipping at all."
21381,Thank you so much. The festival has really increased my sales.
21383,Have them send some men - with a new wagon. This one isn't going anywhere.
21384,I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You get back to camp with news. 
21386,Aha! You're back!
21388,What brings you? You have the look of purpose in your eyes.
21389,Have you seen those Briarheart men? That's some evil magic right there.
21391,"The Reach is a beautiful but dangerous place, eh? One false step and you'll fall to your death, that is if those Forsworn don't get you first."
21392,Don't bother the miners. They've got work to do.
21393,"With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a little."
21398,Never thought I'd be running the store. I'm not used to it.
21399,"Speak with the Griefstricken Chef, at the Windpeak Inn, here in Dawnstar. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. Hail the Listener! Hail Sithis!"
21402,Ffffeeeargh!
21405,"Well... No. Not really. Not directly, I mean."
21408,Let me know when you're ready.
21409,You... you're the Harbinger. Of the Companions. It is my honor to stand before you.
21411,Good idea. Let me know when you're ready.
21415,"If it wasn't for all the dangers in here, this place could almost be cozy."
21417,"If there's nothing else, I have work to do..."
21420,"...Oooh... Cicero wants some Skyforge Steel! Sharp sharp, for easy stabbing..."
21422,"...I saw a dwarf! I did! I did! Cicero saw a dwarf! There... Oh. No, sorry. No dwarf..."
21423,"...the High King's court needs a jester... But not me. No, not Cicero. The Fool of Hearts is busy enough, thank you very much..."
21424,I'm Ainethach's right-hand man. I help supervise the mines.
21426,I hope you know what you're doing.
21430,"Well... It's your son. Nelkir. The boy has been acting increasingly peculiar. Moreso than normal, I mean. Something really should be done..."
21433,"...Cicero never understood thieves, really... take someone's things before you kill them? And they call me crazy..."
21434,"Oh. Was it something I said? I can't afford to lower the price, but come back if you change your mind."
21435,"...need to get Mother some flowers... pretty, pretty flowers..."
21438,The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Sir.
21439,Hroggar doesn't have to know if we sit together. Or drink together. I doubt he would even care.
21440,...Cicero is hungry... ...need a sweetroll... or a carrot...
21441,"So I gave her some advice, pointed her towards Hobs Fall Cave and that was that."
21443,My Saffir doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old sword.
21444,"...dear Cicero will keep you from harm, sweet Mother. Forever and always..."
21446,"I hope you're enjoying the music, sir."
21447,"Her daughter was sent to Whiterun, the skirmishes there have been violent. The whiterun legate, he needed to know the Stormcloak positions."
21451,"...What? Mother? Is that your voice I hear? Hmm... No, no... Just my head playing tricks... Foolish Cicero..."
21452,"As promised, here's the key to the Dwemer Museum. Mind the displays. Some of them are quite fragile."
21453,"...madness is merry, and merriment's might, when the jester comes calling with his knife in the night..."
21454,Just watch yourself. You don't want to meet me on the job.
21455,"As one of our city's most influential citizens, she's has taken it upon herself to oversee their incarceration."
21457,"...when I next meet, that fair maid Nelly, I'll plunge my knife into her belly..."
21460,"...and he says to the man, ""That's not a horker! That's my wife!"" Ha ha ha ha ha... Ah... I love that one... "
21461,"I'll present you as the sacrifice. Just play along. While mother begins the ritual, I'll strike. Then, together we can... we can kill her."
21463,I stand with the Stormcloaks. You Imperial dogs will never break my will. Never!
21464,"...ho ho ho, and hee hee hee, break that lute across my knee... and if the bard, should choose to fight, why then I'll set his clothes alight..."
21465,I can go back to my life for now.
21466,He he he... Crazy? Cicero? He he he he... That's madness...
21467,What? What do you mean?
21468,How much?
21470,Glad Orthus was able to find someone competent to help out.
21472,UUggghhhh.....
21473,You dare invade this Sanctuary?
21474,Tribune.
21475,UUggghhhh.....
21478,What prey awaits us?
21479,"Hey, that's a valuable animal!"
21480,"But more to the point. Do you - tiny, puny, expendable little mortal - actually think you can convince me to leave?  "
21481,My Listener?
21482,The Dread Father works through me. And his work has just begun.
21484,My blade is yours.
21485,Yes... quite. But if that power could be harnessed. Controlled. The possibilities would be...
21486,Could you please leave now?
21487,"In life, I was but a Speaker for the Black Hand. But you have been named Listener. There is no higher honor."
21488,Waiting for what?
21489,I believe I was put here to protect this place from the darkness that pervades Solitude.
21490,"Dreary, dank, and dimly lit. Truly a Sanctuary to call home."
21491,"You know, a good Purification might be just what this Sanctuary needs..."
21495,"Lead on, brother."
21497,"Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Hjaalmarch, allowing Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone to return to Morthal."
21498,Perhaps we should find a random stranger to murder. Practice does make perfect.
21499,Just head north - you can't miss it.
21500,"Please, take pity on an old madman!"
21501,Remember the Winking Skeever next time you're footsore.
21502,"Lead, and I will follow, child of darkness."
21504,"They're the meanest, toughest sons of bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this. "
21505,"Do you feel it? Magic. Deep and ancient. It resonates from the College, like the beating of a heart."
21506,I'm afraid I've lost them.
21507,"What have you done? They'll think I did it. Wait, I did do it! I'm not paying you! This is all your fault!"
21509,"For a stranger, you're not so bad."
21513,Very well. You may enter.
21514,"What do I do to deserve such hatred? You give people good food and good prices, and all they do is insult you."
21516,Remember Uncle Sinderion? These are the plants he was searching for... the Crimson Nirnroot.
21518,"One day, you will serve our Dread Father as I do now."
21522,"The time has come to fulfill your destiny, Listener. Kill the Emperor, and restore the Dark Brotherhood to greatness."
21523,The Sanctuary must be purged of its invading filth!
21524,I'll cut out your eyes and sell 'em for coin!
21525,"Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself."
21526,"But when the Night Mother speaks, the Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis. And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate."
21528,"That one right there, walking out the door. He was one of them asking about that old man you're looking for."
21529,What next?
21530,You can't hide from me forever.
21531,Priest of Arkay. I'm your friend.
21532,"Helping out Ainethach, huh? Give me a reason not to plunge a dagger in your chest."
21533,I do. I've been working on mine for a while now.
21534,"Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company."
21536,Taking it was the only way I could be sure this wasn't a Thalmor trap.
21537,You need to not bother me.
21538,"I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it."
21542,Raise the alarm! We've been infiltrated!
21545,"Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty."
21546,"The nightmares in Dawnstar have lifted, and I hear you helped that happen. You have my thanks."
21548,"Stalking your prey, planting false evidence, destroying an innocent man's reputation. Truly a contract worthy of the Listener."
21550,"I'm busy, is this important?"
21551,Leave... Leave... Leave...
21553,(Sigh)
21554,They started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
21556,Then we have nothing more to talk about.
21559,Damn. It's like everyone in this city has amnesia.
21560,"Ulfric fought for that dream with more courage and honor than any Nord who ever lived. But now he's gone, and the dream is gone with him."
21561,Savos Aren is wise beyond his years. He knows real talent when he sees it.
21563,"Do you need anything, my love?"
21564,"I make no secret of it. I don't care if the Empire controls the city or not, I won't hide my loyalty to the dream of a free Skyrim."
21565,"A few intrepid souls even brought some items back from Morvunskar, the fort southwest of the city."
21567,"I owe you a debt, and I aim to repay it. We'll see each other again someday. For now, goodbye, and thanks."
21569,My men know what to do. Make sure you do your part. I'm putting my city in your hands.
21570,I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life!
21571,But I don't want to be a sailor or a farmer. I want to be a warrior! The strongest one ever!
21575,"His name was Torsten Cruel-Sea. He was really rich, 'cause he owned a whole farm called Hollyfrost."
21576,Dovahkiin zol mul. Zu'u gahvon miri Alduin.
21577,"He told me once that he wanted me to grow up and be a sailor, 'cause that's where our family name comes from."
21579,I am not yours to toy with!
21581,What is this... it's... it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond burns in my mind. It's marvelous....
21583,"In that case, I'm pretty sure it tried to buy me a drink last night."
21586,The ancients built many of the fortresses that dot the landscape of Skyrim.
21587,What is your bidding?
21588,You talk to Reldith yet? She's like a mother to me.
21589,"No, I... I submit. No more."
21591,So you're willing to starve your wife and daughter to reclaim some rusty old sword?
21592,"Yes, my mistress. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone."
21593,"Yes, my lord. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone."
21594,Leave me to my work. Unless you plan to stay and help?
21598,Your sigil stone. Lord Dagon is... less than pleased at its loss.
21599,"But beware - the Empire's loyalty is fickle. They will tire of this war, and then I will be the one dictating terms to you."
21600,Don't I always?
21602,"I didn't tell you this. Faleen likes to act tough, but she really has a soft spot for, of all things, poetry."
21603,"You should be pleased, Elisif. You've done well for yourself as the Empire's pet Jarl."
21604,Your efforts have helped illuminate the entire province. I trust by now you've achieved a higher comprehension of love.
21605,Oh. What's this?
21607,"His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone, and for what?"
21608,"Thank you, Jarl Elisif. I appreciate your loyalty."
21612,"After that, Ulfric... there will be a reckoning. Count on it."
21614,"Seems like a ruin. Dwarven, I think?"
21616,It has done a good thing. It will take this gift as a token of gratitude.
21618,Oh no... what happened here?
21619,Vah...
21626,Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.
21627,Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.
21629,Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!
21630,My sister Camilla or I will be happy to help you.
21632,"Hey, remember that girl, Eisa? The one who sliced open that pickpocket they threw in here?"
21634,"The Blackblood girl? Now there was a fighter. If I didn't know better, I'd say she was a Forsworn woman."
21636,Still here.
21637,I was wondering. Has Faralda been in recently? Borrowed any books that you can recall?
21638,Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.
21640,"On the contrary, you exceed the rest. "
21641,"Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here?"
21642,"Ugh, Draugr. They reek of decay."
21647,You are now ready for your last trial.
21648,Oh! Look over there!
21649,It's just across the bridge and up that hill.
21650,"I meant no disrespect, of course."
21651,"Never underestimate the ability to influence others. Whether they're friends or foes, they're almost all susceptible to Illusion spells."
21653,"An investment, is it? Alright, I'm sure I can put the extra money to good use."
21655,It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with him?
21656,"It is a lonely thing, facing all the dangers of Skyrim by yourself. Come and find me if you decide that you miss my companionship."
21658,We're getting to the point where the tunnels are getting deep into the rock. People complain of bad coughs and foul air.
21659,"You let giants... Giants!... overrun my shrine. Bring me their leader's club as an offering, and I might release you from this curse!"
21661,Gerdur's family first settled here as wood cutters a few generations ago.
21662,You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards. It's a tremendous honor.
21664,"If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue?"
21665,But he won't deal with me. Talk to him; see what it'll take to get my amulet back.
21668,Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.
21669,"So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons."
21671,"You are guilty of insurrection, murder of Imperial citizens, the assassination of King Torygg, and high treason against the Empire."
21675,"Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there."
21676,"Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me."
21677,"I don't know if you've heard, but Jarl Balgruuf said my work is a priority. Which means you should be on your way."
21682,There is no solace in knowing what is to come.
21684,Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to icicles! What are we even doing up here?
21685,"And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you."
21688,I'm the only person alive that can cultivate nirnroot from a seed to a fully grown plant.
21690,"So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace."
21692,You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat like Gleda!
21694,But you always say you want more girls in the bar to begin with!
21695,"Certainly, good lady. Here."
21697,"If you're asking, that means you're the new lifer. Tough luck, friend. Those guards sold you out but good."
21699,"Madanach's guard. Big, even for an Orc. Heard he ripped a man's arm off and beat him to death with it. He's old-fashioned like that."
21701,Master Borri is waiting.
21702,Hey! You dropped this back there.
21703,Then allow me to officially welcome you to Riften. You'll make a fine addition to our city.
21704,But the people I asked say no one enters or leaves....
21705,The new meat. So soft. Tender.
21706,Wait. Did you hear that? I think it came this way.
21707,No. There are too many people around. Come with me.
21709,We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
21710,Come out! We know you're here!
21711,Rip the eyes from her head!
21712,Stendarr's Mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra. We have to get help.
21715,Get over there and see what you can do.
21717,"They focus on research banned by the Synod, such as Conjuration and Necromancy."
21719,Bone chimes... clever. Rigged to wake the draugr I'd bet. Don't blunder into any of them.
21720,"Shut up or they'll kill us, you idiot! Once they're gone I'll pick the lock..."
21721,You first. Come on. Let's go.
21723,"You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire."
21725,Just remember I'm here if you rethink your decision.
21726,"Get out of my head, Daedra!"
21729,We're gathering for our final assault on Solitude. I need you there. Report to our camp in Haafingar.
21732,Go to each focal point and remove whatever impurities you may find there.
21734,"When I was a boy, my friends and I used to play ""seek the wumpus"" in caves much like this."
21736,Good. They'll think twice before crossing us while their command structure is in disarray.
21740,We will make do somehow. We always have.
21742,"Now that the Empire's arrived in Riften, we've finally established a launching point into Morrowind... just in case."
21747,"Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire."
21749,"But I also want you to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital."
21750,"I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit."
21751,We're gathering for our final assault on Windhelm. Report to our camp in Eastmarch.
21754,"Well, I suppose I needn't wonder where he is anymore."
21757,And don't think I've forgotten that you were the one that gave it to Ulfric in the first place.
21758,"What? Why, the audacity! How dare you imply such a thing!"
21764,Not for you. Not for anyone.
21765,"Of course. Every night I pray that we don't get a visit from a dragon, or that two armies don't show up to fight over the bridge."
21766,"Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you?"
21767,"Why thank, you... you're very kind. Still interested?"
21768,Break our men out and head to the courtyard. We'll meet you there.
21771,Make your way to our camp in the Rift. We have a few surprises for the Stormcloaks lined up.
21772,I don't think so!
21773,"Sister dear, could you try sewing those sleeves a little tighter? We can't have our customers looking sloppy because of your work."
21775,What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get blood from a stone.
21777,"Make your way to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital."
21778,"Bit of advice, folks here don't care for magic or those that use it. If you're intent on it, check at the College up in Winterhold."
21779,You've done it. The shrine is ours again.
21780,"I'll present this to the Jarl later. As for you, let me show you some smithing techniques."
21781,But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep.
21782,Sissel thinks she's so special. No way she's more special than me.
21783,And so it is done.
21785,"You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way."
21788,"Well, err, yes. Sorry to have troubled you."
21789,"Yes, the staff. Interesting..."
21790,"They're my puppets. I have their ""king"" rotting in Cidhna Mine."
21792,"Of course it has. Would you expect any less of me? Here, this is your half, my love."
21793,"Thongvor, do you really think that's wise? I mean, King Ulfric is such a busy man, and there are so many areas of Skyrim to protect."
21794,"After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild."
21795,That wasn't a fair swing.
21796,"Look, I never needed treasure. My father owns land; our family is wealthy. I just wanted adventure. Not this."
21797,"I'd like to offer you a place in my court, as a Thane. It's mainly an honorary title, but there are a few perks."
21798,"You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers."
21799,"Ah, I see. Very well, my friend. I'll do it."
21800,We take our leave.
21801,Go with the gods.
21802,And we gave it to Erikur?
21803,Time to show what you're really made of.
21805,"Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be reasonable. I'll... I'll pay next month."
21806,It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do.
21807,"Good. And while you're at it, perhaps you should sew your mouth shut when our fine customers are within earshot, hrm?"
21808,Gods be with you.
21811,Get out of my face!
21812,"Ugor, no! This may be the one we need."
21813,You've been even-handed so far. What do you say to our demand?
21816,"Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes."
21818,Is that you?
21820,Sir!
21821,Sir! I... I have... <breathing hard>
21822,"Take a moment to breathe, soldier."
21824,Keep an eye out for trouble. It's only a matter of time.
21826,But... sir...
21829,"Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast."
21830,Seems a bit short to me.
21831,"I wish we could offer more help, but our last attack went sour and we're all that is left."
21832,"You there, pretty lady. You need some fresh meat for your family? Just look at the blood coming from this cut...."
21833,Breathe!
21836,"Welcome to Belethor's General Goods. Welcome, indeed."
21837,The outer walls are strong. If we can hold them there...
21838,"Still learning the ropes, but I'll get the hang of it."
21839,"Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a stop to this!"
21840,Traitor!
21844,Look out! Draugr!
21845,It pleases me to know that I can still be of use even in the twilight of my life.
21846,"Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. We need to show Tullius we won't be pushed around."
21849,I staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.
21850,My scouts tell me they're loading them with fire.
21852,The men will be fighting in flames.
21853,My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried about.
21854,"I love my husband, but he can be a bit... dull at times."
21856,No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must. 
21859,Really? What did you go and do that for? You... you need to go away.
21860,"We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you."
21862,"Divines preserve you, you're a hero. We'll re-open the Hall right away."
21866,What's she doing? Looking for rubies in rubbish? Get a job!
21871,Very well.
21873,Nothing Vulwulf.... cheers.
21874,Damnit. What's he waiting for?
21876,"You're serious, aren't you?"
21880,"Those are College of Winterhold robes, aren't they?"
21881,That's what everyone keeps saying. But you didn't kill her. That's what I was asking.
21884,What?!
21885,"Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon."
21886,I'm waiting.
21887,I'm feeling a sense of inner peace... something I haven't felt in a very long time.
21888,I have a business proposition for any sailors who might be looking to make a few extra septims.
21890,"Sir, I tried."
21891,This is it! Time to see what these Stormcloaks are made of.
21892,The men are already gathering at the gates. 
21897,"The Stormcloaks are living on borrowed time, believe me."
21898,Move it soldier. Spread the word. Go. Go. Go.
21901,They'd stop at nothing to take your last bit of food if that's all you had.
21902,I do. Still want to buy it?
21903,"And now it's within my grasp... but the Eight, it seems, have chosen me for their amusement."
21904,It's damn near impossible to find anymore. You want to buy it off of me?
21905,"Well then, you're talking to the right person. I'm the only one left in Tamriel that can get my hands on it."
21907,"Very much so, and thank you for asking."
21908,"We'll protect Erikur as best we're able, but I fear the throne of Solitude is cursed."
21909,"Once you have summoned the Dremora, you will order it to deliver to you a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate."
21910,"Bandits are desperate men. They have nothing to lose, and they fight like it."
21912,Arkay helps us find peace with death.
21913,The Balmora Blue is locked in a chest under the docks near the Red Wave. Hope you like getting wet.
21915,"When you get to Whiterun just keep going up. When you get to the top of the hill, you're at Dragonsreach, the Jarl's palace."
21916,"Good. Here, take this key."
21917,"Begging your pardon, milord. Your wife has run up quite an account in the last few months."
21921,"Oh, now, do be careful..."
21922,They were among the first men to arrive from Atmora and they worshipped certain animals as avatars of the Gods; Dragons being foremost.
21923,"I'm afraid not. How else can a poor, overworked sailor like myself expect to earn a living?"
21924,"Ah, you're a smart woman. That's exactly what I wanted to hear."
21926,"Tell him I'll pay double the normal price. We've been getting by with one broken pitchfork, but it's falling apart."
21927,"Look, you want it, I got it. You know the price, so talk to me when you want to cough up the gold."
21928,Watch out for the hot steam vents down here. They'll burn you worse than fire.
21929,"I'm sorry you feel my illegal contraband is overpriced, perhaps you should bring it up at the next merchant guild meeting."
21930,You have to find the way out first. Good luck with that.
21932,It's also very illegal. Anyone caught with Balmora Blue looks forward to rotting in jail for a very long time.
21933,"Gods, I can't run away from this. I have to stop her."
21934,"Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event."
21935,"This isn't over. I catch you sending one letter to General Tullius, I'll have you both executed."
21936,"The fool went absolutely berserk! He wounded Veezara, tried to kill me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted."
21938,They usually make runs along the coast shipping all sorts of contraband to and from Morrowind.
21940,Don't want to talk about it.
21942,I'm honored to be leading the latest generation of Namira's faithful. Those who have embraced what they are.
21943,"Some day soon, you will all see battle. And what you do here, today, may well save your lives!"
21945,And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess.
21946,No. This coven has existed for thousands of years. Namira is a goddess. She has been worshipped since time began.
21948,Huuragh!
21950,Even rags would be preferable to your current wardrobe. Or lack thereof...
21951,"Well it stops now, and that's final!"
21952,The endless sleep comes for us all...
21953,Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like wet dog.
21954,"The Reach has been part of Skyrim for a thousand years, but the Reachmen still haven't accepted it."
21956,You're needed in Winterhold. Report to our hidden camp there.
21957,"I'll tell you what... I'll play a special song, just for you, for no charge at all."
21958,And then there's this Orc who's been hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.
21960,"Thank you, milady."
21962,"Thank you, milord."
21965,You've returned.
21969,"Right away, milady."
21970,"Right away, milord."
21972,You mistake me. I'm not saying no - just wondering about your intentions.
21973,"My business is falling apart, my apprentice never listens to me and now there's talk of dragons."
21974,Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding.
21977,"So I took his advice, and here I am. This life might not look like much to you, but I'm content, and isn't that all that matters?"
21978,"He said ""Gwilin, you have the whole world before you. Go out and experience it... be whatever you want to be."""
21982,"I am not your plaything, worm!"
21985,"I lost my family years ago. Truth is, I don't really know what keeps me going."
21986,Stay out of trouble.
21987,Never!
21990,That's a shame. Too many people in Riften share your view and look where its getting them.
21995,"I'm a Blade, now. I can hardly believe it."
21996,After all you've put that man through. You should be more loyal to him.
21997,"I'm bored, Benor. Nobody wants to have any fun with me."
21998,"If you leave that kinslayer Hroggar, I would be happy to keep your company."
22000,I'm not ready to die. I'm just not...
22002,"Were you certain in your purpose, you would have no need to apologize."
22004,You can make your own potions by mixing up to three ingredients together. Just use the Alchemy Lab.
22005,He was quite clear that he felt more in his element climbing through a window rather than hunched over a dusty tome.
22006,For Kodlak!
22007,Mjoll told me that it isn't this bad everywhere. Maybe one day I'll venture out and see if she's right.
22008,"You can eat an ingredient to learn one of its properties. However, they taste disgusting."
22011,"Before you can enchant your weapon or armor, you'll need to learn an enchantment by sacrificing an enchanted item. Just use the arcane enchanter."
22012,It's from... Falk Firebeard at the Blue Palace? You've got friends in high places.
22014,"Need a poison for your hunting? My mother, Murbul, knows several."
22015,"Yes, indeed."
22016,"Very well, I trust that you wouldn't be here were it not significant."
22018,"Oh, wow. I knew it. I knew they were real! I have to remember to tell papa."
22019,Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed. But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary?
22020,"Want to improve your armor? Use the workbench. Make sure you have the right raw materials, such as iron or steel."
22021,"If you want to sharpen your blade, use the grindstone. Although you'll need the right raw materials, such as iron or steel."
22022,Make sure to pull your bow all the way back to get the most power out of your shot.
22023,Hevnoraak is defeated.
22024,Here. Give this letter to Camilla and tell her it's from Sven. Let's see what she thinks of him after reading that.
22025,"Those big, powerful blows are tiring. Pace yourself until you've got the stamina to do one."
22026,"No, no girl. It's the pickled spider tongue and then the decayed taproot. Do it the other way, and your cure turns into a poison."
22027,Pretty angry actually. I can't believe I botched the Goldenglow job. That should have been like stealing a sweetroll from a baby.
22029,"No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now."
22031,"But first, you must restore to me my beacon."
22034,"A word of advice, my friend --  do not mix gambling and drink. Taken together, they will empty your pockets of every septim. "
22035,"Unfortunately for you, we don't allow men into the inner sanctum."
22036,We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.
22037,I'd be dead if not for Vignar. He took me in and helped me turn my life around.
22038,Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.
22040,"I'm old enough to decide how to live my life, and I'd be honored to wear your armor, if you'd just let me. I'm strong enough to handle it."
22041,The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
22042,"Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow."
22043,Got a tip on a desirable item at this location. We want you to break in there and bring it to us. What do you think?
22044,"When the other guy has his shield up, regular blows are useless. Wind up and hit him with a really powerful attack to get past that shield."
22045,Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven and the Guild.
22047,I won't let you hurt Alva!
22048,She's mine! She's my reward. You can't have her!
22049,"As you wish, Listener."
22052,"When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat."
22053,"Very well, Listener."
22054,Not many come to see me. What do you want?
22055,"Mama, when is Cade coming home?"
22056, 
22057,Are you looking for a fight?
22058,I've been playing this game for almost 20 years. Sending the young to their deaths. All in the name of the Forsworn. And I'm tired. So tired.
22059,"Oh, all right then, Listener. Cicero will just carry on with what he was doing. Until you say otherwise."
22060,We shall soon find out.
22061,The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.
22063,"Yes, Listener."
22067,"If you happen upon any of our caravans in your travels, we'd also be more than willing to pay you a fair sum for any of your stolen goods."
22070,Ooh! Listener! That tickles!
22071,Now - hear his name. Odahviing. Taste it on the wind. Od-ah-viing. Know it in your su'um. Od-ah-viing!
22072,"With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat."
22077,"This is all just too much, too fast. Go get some work from Nazir. I need time to... to think..."
22078,Good. You're clearly better suited than I am to carry out such a menial task.
22083,"Even if one of these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to have to find a way through that door."
22085,Stay close to the wall!
22086,Yes. I have something a little different planned this time.
22088,"I hold my own beliefs, but thanks anyway."
22093,"Get up, papa! Get up!"
22095,"They're fighting over that thing, I think."
22096,But aren't the Circle in charge? And don't you lead them?
22097,"There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war."
22098,"Many of us have begun to question Alduin's lordship, whether his Thu'um was truly the strongest."
22099,That a boy. You're doing great.
22101,That should be all right. How much space were you planning?
22102,"If you want to talk about my brother, I'm not interested."
22103,"That's it, son. Make me proud."
22105,Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal.
22106,Your free will is an illusion. Whether you acknowledge me or not is your own business. But I will be in your mind.
22108,The Thalmor need to be taught a lesson.
22109,You performed your duties to the letter.
22115,Nah...
22116,Haal!
22117,"You've not only earned your payment, but my respect as well. And believe me, friend - that does not come easily."
22118,I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this.
22119,Oh if only I could provide more than this coin. I hope it'll do.
22121,So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.
22124,Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.
22125,"Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems."
22126,"There's a pack of werewolf hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock."
22127,"Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well..."
22128,I have Alva to take care of now. I don't need Helgi anymore.
22130,So we send in Vex and find out he's hired a bunch of mercenaries to guard the place.
22131,"I warn you, Gray-Mane, you are treading on dangerous ground."
22132,What are you still doing here? The Jarl said retrieving that stone tablet is a priority. Remember?
22133,Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!
22134,"You'll have to see the Jarl about that. Maybe his steward, Avenicci. I'm sure one of them will pay you appropriately."
22136,"Papa used to say I was greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him. I miss him..."
22140,I do indeed.
22142,"My... associate will be pleased at your resourcefulness. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me."
22144,"Oh, very well. Just try and clean yourself up."
22145,"Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule Solitude, I will garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city."
22149,"Oh. Well, you should probably go get it before someone steals it."
22150,"If you lose, well, you'll know the freedom of Sovngarde if you're lucky."
22152,There is no point in further talk. Go now!
22154,I can't imagine what happened to the dwarves. How could a race with the capability to build a place like this simply vanish?
22156,"Petty thieving, huh? Just like poor Grisvar. Hopefully you'll learn your lesson faster than he has."
22157,You heard the man! Drink and be merry!
22159,Not right now. You bought my last one.
22164,"Walk always in the light, or we will drag you to it."
22167,"Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?"
22170,Bow to your betters!
22172,Halt!
22173,"If you're looking for anything to sell for a fair price, I run the Pawned Prawn over by the market."
22175,So I ran. Joined the Forsworn. Started killing. Got caught. Now I'm here.
22177,"How long have you run this place, again?"
22178,"A Nord nobleman I served was stabbed in the night. Wasn't me, but I knew I'd be blamed."
22180,Because life was better under the old ways. No Nords and their laws.
22186,"The Imperials are good for business, and business is good for Skyrim."
22187,"Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with."
22192,Do the bees need to be happy?
22195,"We have as much right to be at this council as all of you. More, actually, since we were the ones that put the Dragonborn on this path."
22196,"Thank you, friend. Don't worry. I'll have that shiv ready for you."
22198,"Ah, you're a clever one aren't you? Now, here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?"
22199,"Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance."
22201,"All right, but if you change your mind. Not like we're going anywhere."
22202,"Ask all you want, you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Not in this part of the world anyway."
22203,"Well all right. Here, I scribbled down the last place I'd heard about. Check it out, but be careful."
22205,"You give me one more look, and I cut you open. That Skooma's mine."
22206,You are new to Morthal. We have not spoken before. This is interesting.
22211,Enough already. Put on some clothes. You're making people nervous.
22212,"The path to Paarthurnax is perilous, not to be embarked upon lightly."
22213,Skooma addict. Get lost.
22214,Looks like I chose the right person for the job.
22215,"First, you must open this door."
22216,"Enough! We can't imprison the very people that own the jail we would be throwing them into. The Silver-Blood family are to be left alone, am I clear?"
22219,A true friend is a gift. Here. I'd like you to have this.
22221,Try our meats made here at the Festival. They're the best.
22226,Smart.
22227,"You dare to betray us, Illia?"
22228,Watch this.
22230,"It's my boy Sven you need to listen to. He sings at the inn, most every night."
22232,"Here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?"
22234,"Right away, sir!"
22237,"You wanted me to do something, yes?"
22238,"I will serve Gularzob as best I can, even though I am his elder."
22239,That doesn't change anything.
22240,"We are all blood here. One family, one tribe."
22241,"Yamarz betrayed us all. I will never allow that to happen again, so long as I rule."
22243,I had heard that Gjukar's men were wiped out. I came to find you.
22244,"Please don't mind Joric. He's not mad, really he's not."
22245,I am honored to have been chosen to lead. But I know that being picked by Malacath does not mean that I am ready.
22246,"We have learned from our mistakes. Malacath's needs come first, and we will serve him faithfully."
22247,"Good. If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to Oblivion... he's not welcome here any more."
22251,Ro...
22252,Largashbur will not soon forget what you have done. We have a second chance thanks to you.
22253,"Gularzob has been chosen as chief. He will one day be great, but he has much to learn."
22255,Think carefully where your loyalties lie... sister.
22256,"I killed a lot of High Elves in the Great War, and I didn't die. I guess that makes me a war hero."
22259,I've worked with metal long enough that I almost never burn myself anymore.
22265,"I don't know who in Windhelm would even have something like that. Other than me, of course. "
22266,Only a true Orc knows how to temper Orichalcum properly.
22267,Well. I trust you have something vitally important to tell me. Important enough to interrupt me in the middle of council?
22268,"It matters not. The plant cares nothing for the rays that bring it the warmth of the sun. As you carry Dawnbreaker, so will my light touch the world."
22269,"The only thing you need to know is that they almost destroyed the world, and they were stopped. A long time ago."
22275,"And so the Empire runs roughshod over Skyrim, as usual."
22277,"These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I."
22280,"I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event."
22281,"Take care, husband."
22282,"Skyrim was not J'zargo's first choice, but Winterhold is removed from politics, dedicated to study. This is the place for J'zargo to become great."
22283,Stay away! Last time you hurt me.
22284,"At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm."
22286,With good planning and constant vigilance.
22287,"Yes! Yes, you can. She's all saddled up and everything."
22291,But learning a Word of Power is only the first step... you must unlock its meaning through constant practice in order to use it in a Shout.
22294,Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.
22295,No day goes by where I am not tempted to return to my inborn nature. Zin krif horvut se suleyk.
22296,You must first prove you are in control.
22297,"Well then, it's too bad my wife is already taken."
22298,I serve no mortal!
22299,Fine. Let's go.
22303,"You control nothing, mortal!"
22306,I watch you to make sure you are honorable. 
22307,"Again, and we break his grim hold over Shor's realm, and redeem it for eternity!"
22311,"You lead, I'll follow."
22316,I continue to hear things about dragon sightings in Skyrim.
22317,"Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time."
22318,"Now now, fella. Let's not get too close to my new bride, eh?"
22319,A stretch in the Castle Dour Dungeon will straighten you right out.
22320,If it even exists.
22321,Forgive me. I was... intemperate. I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty.
22322,"Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the moment, but we're already overstretched."
22324,"I hope my son has found some nice, well-mannered girl to settle down with."
22325,"Please step back, there's an execution in process."
22327,"But he thinks everything used to be better. I, for one, would trust any Companion with my life."
22328,"To hear Vignar tell it, they're a bunch of layabouts and useless whiners who used to know how to fight."
22329,Ah! Are you planning on hurting me again?
22330,It's good to see a fresh face. You wouldn't have happen to come from Whiterun would you?
22331,"Attic room, eh? Well... we don't have an attic room, but you can have the one on the left. Make yourself at home."
22332,"Now, you are going to speak to this... Monk... and find out why he is here, and then he will be removed from College grounds."
22334,Death is the only way out of your misery!
22336,Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!
22339,Word is spreading like magefire! The great evil has been vanquished! You have truly saved us all!
22346,Get your fresh fruit and produce here!
22347,Don't think I don't know what's coming.
22348,"When we arrive, blood is spilled and our blades sing to the glories of Ysgramor."
22349, 
22351,"The short answer is: we fight. The long answer is... eh, forget it. You're not worth my time."
22353,Are you looking to join? I wouldn't get your hopes up.
22355,Please! Don't shoot!
22358,It's never been an issue. People say you helped with the problems at Wolfskull Cave.
22359,"Ah, Aegisbane. Sigil of Clan Shatter-Shield. But didn't that get stolen awhile back? Hmph. Must be rememberin' wrong."
22360,"If you seek either, you've found the right place."
22362,Why would you even come to Jorrvaskr without knowing what we stand for?
22363,"Runs the Blood Horkers, and makes sure the battles end right-side up."
22365,"But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hmmm? No. No... Of course not. Because then Cicero would get angry, and that would be... ugly."
22366,The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge.
22367,"Haven't seen you here before, egg sister. Welcome!"
22368,You'll hear some of the brighter faces around here talk about honor and glory.
22372,Stay sharp.
22373,The Companions are my family. We fight so that other people don't have to. 
22375,"...Yeah. We can't have that rheumy-eyed fool as our watchman, even if he is Hajvarr's uncle. Time we dealt with both of them."
22376,I've been here longer than most of them. Even I don't know sometimes. I just hope they don't kill each other.
22378,"It was the Forsworn, wasn't it? I lose dozens of shipments every season to those barbarians. Now they're in the city? Gods help us."
22379,"Maybe you've seen masts sticking out of the water to the northeast? That would be the wreck of the Winter War. Fine vessel, back in its day."
22382,Go away.
22383,Mercenaries. Warriors of honor. Brothers and sisters of the blade. Drunken rabble. Take your pick.
22384,"The only untapped market left is Markarth. However, I just got word that Kleppr at The Silver Blood Inn might be interested."
22386,Gods be praised.
22388,I doubt that very much.
22390,And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.
22391,An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor. 
22392,"Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll be well -prepared to face threats both magical and mundane."
22394,I don't like it. What are they waiting for?
22395,"Go quiet, break him out, then run. This isn't a suicide mission. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell."
22396,"Truth is, I found out about all the Imperial spies crawling around Falkreath. A few well-placed bribes, and they bought themselves some friends. "
22397,"This is life, sister. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath."
22398,I'm too swift for you!
22399,"They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers."
22401,"Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King."
22403,"Oh, I know, Thonar. Only a mad woman would ever betray the Silver-Blood family."
22405,Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important. No entering Pelagius' Wing without that.
22406,"Yeah. Uh, I know you hurt someone in town recently."
22408,This cold is unbearable. It's all I can do not to shiver until my teeth rattle.
22409,You seem to be a bit closer to Brynjolf than the rest of us. Is he giving you any idea why this place seems to be falling apart?
22410,Can we really just make things up? It doesn't seem right.
22411,Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?
22414,"Aha! Here we are. Honored guests, I present to you - the Gourmet!"
22415,"Too confusing for me. Empire, Nords, Talos. Who cares?"
22416,"You should see my mother, Sharamph, if you need a cure or a poison."
22417,But I'll follow the old man's lead. As ever.
22420,Alain used me to get close to my friends. And now they all think I'm some kind of... monster. Alain Dufont took my life. And now I'm taking his.
22421,I've got one!
22423,None of our business. There's no honor to be had in the squabbling of jarls.
22424,"Politics are something best avoided. I prefer more personal confrontations, myself."
22425,I know I sound abrasive. It's just that I love Mauhulakh so much that I want us to be happy together.
22430,"No, not that kind of spell. Believe me when I say I wouldn't be asking if it weren't necessary."
22431,You. You must take the Lexicon. Free me of my burden.
22433, 
22434,"In charge of what? I'm in charge of me, and you're in charge of you."
22436,You dare fight a Dunmer?
22437,Looks like you weren't followed. Good.
22438,I've really missed traveling like this. Walking the breadth of Skyrim has always filled my heart with excitement.
22441,"Kodlak advises them, but he doesn't really give orders."
22442,"That's Aela, Skjor, and the brothers, Farkas and Vilkas. "
22444,The Circle are the ones who parcel out the jobs.
22445,"If you want to embarrass yourself, I won't stop you. Kodlak is the Harbinger. He's the closest thing you'll find to a leader around here."
22446,"I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?"
22447,You don't just waddle in here and get to speak to the boss. Who do you think you are?
22448,Now that is a shame.
22449,The Greybeards can tell you much more than I can. They're the masters of the Way of the Voice and taught Tiber Septim himself.
22450,"The College of Winterhold is truly an asset to our city... err, town."
22451,"Soon enough, it'll be me. In the meanwhile, the Circle handles our daily routine, and Kodlak advises them as Harbinger."
22452,You're the best! Can you be my father?
22453,Treat her right and she'll make you rich. Try and rip her off and you'll have the whole Guild to answer to.
22460,I will serve Dawnstar as I always have.
22461,You should probably be in bed. You're looking a bit under the weather.
22463,What? How?
22464,"Oh, I'm not a Companion, myself. I just help Vignar. He took me in when I was having a tough time, and... well, I owe him."
22466,Only that it happened. 
22467,"Now, then, boy. Helgen was destroyed? How did you get away?"
22470,Or else what? You'll kill me? I already had to face that today.
22471,Get me down. Get me down!
22472,The word is that Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood.
22474,"A man of my station has many debts. I'm not much use at labor or learning, but I can throw a punch with the best of 'em."
22476,"You're only young once. Trust me, I know."
22477,"But... J'zargo is pleased to see that you are here, and not in pieces!"
22478,"Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you."
22479,"Skjor says it was more like forty, but he's just being modest."
22480,Haven't you heard the stories of Kodlak and Skjor fighting off the hundred-and-one Orc berserkers?
22481,Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier to the inner sanctum.
22482,Ah...Viing!
22483,So I wouldn't have to answer stupid questions from idiots.
22484,"Fortune and glory, friend. Fortune and glory."
22485,"It is a hard time for all of us. I hope that you too can find some sanctuary here, Mathies."
22486,"Excellent! We've hit 'em where it hurts. Repairs will be needed when we take over, but at least the Stormcloaks won't benefit in the meantime."
22487,"Here you go, sir. The finest Colovian brandy."
22488,"I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings."
22489,"My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there."
22493,"It's held many names: Dagger of the Final Wounds, Bane of the Righteous, the Kingslayer."
22494,"Taking me up on my offer, eh? Good."
22495,"You come do an honest day's work at my mill, and I'll pay you an honest day's wages. Then we'll drink."
22496,"It was lit one hundred and sixty-three years ago, back when this building was the home of a grand warrior named Vundheim."
22497,He left to fight in the Great War and never came back. So he's not my problem anymore.
22498,"If you want to know, ask Nelacar. He's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Knows the whole sad story."
22499,"We were brought here by Jergen. Whether he was our father or not, I don't care."
22500,"I love my brother, but his brains are not his strong suit. "
22501,"Why are you speaking to me, Imperial?"
22504,Even Vignar couldn't remember Companions younger than us!
22505,"Ooh, real tough, wagging your weapon around..."
22506,Talos protect you.
22507,I knew I'd find you!
22508,"Our father, Jergen, raised us here. "
22511,Krah!
22512,"Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call."
22513,"Well maybe if you would finally convince Thongvor to put you in charge of the family, I wouldn't need to question you anymore."
22514,I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt.
22516,Looking to stay alive? Why take a chance?
22517,"Of course, the money is still good. And the drinks!"
22518,I'm glad you were able to correct your mistake. I'll release Wuunferth immediately.
22519,I was lucky the Companions found me. Now there's a reason to be fighting. The honor of my brothers and sisters is worth more than coin.
22520,There are few places where one can pursue my type of work without fear of persecution.
22521,"You're the one all the guards are talking about. You went into that Sanctuary... wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! Friend, I owe you a drink."
22522,"The money was good, and the women were good, and the drinks were good. But I was losing myself. My heart. "
22526,Cidhna Mine's for prisoner scum only. Keep out.
22528,I learned the ways of the blade in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City. 
22530,"And Betrid Silver-Blood is always asking for more potions to fuel Thonar's ""ambitions."" Gives him a temper fiercer than any bear."
22532,Here. Let me show you some of the things the temple healers taught me about potions.
22533,"Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, girl."
22537,"He promised a paradise awaited his followers when they died, that they would be reborn by Mehrunes Dagon's side."
22538,These terms are not acceptable. You know that.
22539,"Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, boy."
22540,"Oh, thank you!"
22541,I hate those things. Too many eyes or something.
22544,This is a curse that was laid upon us. That much is clear.
22546,"It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter."
22549,It's like being born. Every time.
22550,They don't like us talking to people when we work.
22552,Let me give you a piece of advice. If you want to make some serious coin in this business you need to listen to rules.
22553,And when I feel myself filling with the blood of the wolf... it's like I'm bringing all the strength of all the beasts inside me.
22554,"I was raised in the woods. Hunting every animal I could see, with my father. I know them all as well as I know my own mind."
22555,"What do I care about Sovngarde? Give me the power to tear my foes as a beast of the wild, and I will savor it."
22556,"Time to die, hero!"
22557,"The old man and I have our differences when it comes to this. It's a blessing, given by Hircine. "
22558,A sensitive question. You may want to be careful broaching that subject with some.
22560,"I keep searching for some hope of Sovngarde, but to no avail."
22562,"For me, a heavy burden. "
22565,"It's a guild of Altmer thieves, they call themselves the Summerset Shadows."
22569,"I don't know who you've been talking to, but they were clearly mistaken. "
22570,"In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't normal dreams."
22571,Vomindok. I do not know. Perhaps in the very doing they erased the knowing of it from Time itself.
22572,"I think there are some things that... oh, wait. Are you trying to trick me? You are not a full-blood yet. We can't talk about that."
22573,"If I make enough money from the farm, I'll buy myself a longship to sail the rivers of Skyrim."
22574,What did I tell you? Keep quiet about that.
22575,"And if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one who can stop them."
22577,Don't get too many folks up here these days. Sometimes I think they've forgotten about me.
22578,"You shouldn't even know about that. Remember you're not a full Companion yet, whelp. Know your place."
22579,That's your imagination running wild. Nobody knows how we feel about each other.
22580,"Thank you! Thank you! I'll never speak of this to anyone, I promise!"
22582,I don't want to see you treating any of these books poorly. Are we clear?
22584,What the... we've been betrayed! Look out!
22589,My advice? Don't overthink it. Fight well and the rest takes care of itself.
22590,I think.
22591,We have Shield-Siblings to keep our backs as dangerous as our fronts.
22592,"It means when I have troubles, I always have someone on my side."
22593,Ah! I feel like I just woke from a nap.
22594,"Millwork sure is boring, but at least I don't have to work in a nasty mine."
22595,"To be counted in that line is a bit of immortality. Even if I never see Sovngarde, I'll have that much."
22596,"The oldest fighting group in Skyrim, and nothing but glory from Ysgramor's day to our own."
22598,So much.
22600,I'm afraid he's asked to not be disturbed. He has important business.
22601,"When you got that much, we'll talk."
22602,"Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of Ustengrav."
22604,"We try to uphold the legacy of Ysgramor. To bear his good name such that it never be forgotten, and always be spoken with reverence."
22605,"You have no business in our stronghold, outlander."
22609,"She was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair."
22610,But there's always been a kind of honor to it. We don't deal in politics or underhanded sneaking. 
22612,"Without it, we're just a bunch of petty thieves."
22613,There's been a group called the Companions for over 4000 years. It's been many different things in that time.
22614,"When we step into battle, we fight for our own name, and the name of the Companions."
22618,I've never been a smart one. But the Companions welcome anyone with the heart of a warrior.
22620,"It means waking up every day knowing that you could die, and having to earn your life by clawing for every breath."
22621,My brother told me you were coming. I'm supposed to give you what you've earned.
22622,"But when it's time to draw blood, there's no one in Skyrim I'd rather have at my back."
22623,"It means resting your haunches in Whiterun more than I'd care to, for one."
22626,"I would trust anyone here with my life, which is more than I'd say for the milk drinkers who raised me."
22627,"Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Solitude botanical gardens. Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are?"
22628,Well we have to harvest somewhere! This is getting absurd.
22629,I wish more of our ranks asked such questions. 
22630,Amazing... you can see how the Akaviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...
22631,Deal with problems head on. Leave whispers and sneaking to the gutter rats who can't fight for themselves.
22632,"Honningbrew uses only the finest natural honey, not that sludge you'll find at Goldenglow Estate."
22635,"Glory in battle, honor in life. "
22638,"The Greybeards tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning."
22639,"Mostly food supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time."
22640,"Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll."
22642,"Well, it's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food."
22643,"That's generous, Jala, but I am happy to pay my way."
22644,"Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done."
22645,I should not have agreed to host this council. The Greybeards have no business involving ourselves in such matters.
22648,"No one's seen them in well over a hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle of Artaeum."
22649,Really? That would be kind of you.
22651,"You made it out alive, at least. Your gear's safe in my room, as promised."
22653,Halt in the name of the Jarl!
22655,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
22656,"Oh, certainly I hope not! That would be quite unfortunate for my research."
22657,Hello.
22658,"I'm glad we've taken back Winterhold. While the Imperials were up there, important resources were tied up stiffening our northern border."
22659,"I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point."
22660,I have one. A nephew. He's in prison for being a member of the Forsworn.
22661,You aren't as attractive as you'd like to believe.
22665,It's difficult to explain to the layman -- forgive me if I begin waxing alchemic. 
22666,Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
22668,This stronghold is for the Orcs. Leave. Now.
22670,"Quite a climb, wasn't it?"
22672,"We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not."
22673,"Other than that, watch your footing. In these wintry conditions, the stairs can be treacherous."
22674,"Well, there's the occasional wolf pack or stray, but that's all I've ever had to deal with. Shouldn't be a problem for the likes of you."
22676,Have yourself a great day!
22678,Now go give those stupid bears what's coming to them!
22679,"If you get a chance, kill a few more bears for me, will you?"
22680,Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.
22681,"Welp, time to gather more supplies I guess."
22683,Thanks again for the legwork.
22684,"It's Falion. He... He did it. I don't know what it was, but he did it."
22685,I...I'm fading away!
22686,Hmph. What a boring conversation.
22687,Reyda! Reyyyyda!
22688,Good. And I hope you were careful in that lumber mill. Those splinters and rusty nails can be quite nasty.
22689,The mountain will eat you! Watch the mountain!
22690,Narfi so happy! So happy! So happy!
22696,Good luck getting one of the guards to help with anything.
22697,I wish I could go with you...
22698,I'm just saying that these ceramic lamps make me nervous. They just seem so... fragile.
22699,Most people would need to train for years before they could even attempt a single Shout.
22700,Looks like nobody here knows what's happened yet. Come on. Gerdur's probably working in her lumber mill.
22701,Get moving!
22702,Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor.
22703,Just get out of town as fast as you can. Nothing for anyone here.
22705,"He was too privileged and too foolish, more interested in entertaining his queen than ruling his country."
22706,"A pleasant journey, milady."
22707,Farengar can explain the situation better than I can.
22709,Shoot the far target.
22710,Call... that... a... swing?
22713,"If you pass through again, stop by for a drink."
22714,"If you're headed up to the monastery, watch your step... it's a long way down."
22715,Keep your eyes open in the barrow... that's how they get you!
22717,Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing?
22718,He didn't want to hit the bar like the rest! Ha ha ha!
22720,That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone.
22722,"Mining accident, back when I was in prison for being a pickpocket."
22723,It does not matter to M'aiq how strong or smart one is. It only matters what one can do.
22724,"Your compassion is admirable, but you see, we cannot help them all. The poor must learn from the examples of the gods and raise themselves up."
22727,"Ysmir's beard, you're going to freeze to death..."
22730,Find Arniel Gane. He's somewhere in the northern section of the ruins. He'll show you what to do.
22731,You should have acted. They're already here.
22733,"Right, then. You prefer to listen, is that it? Well, you must represent the Dark Brotherhood. I certainly wasn't expecting anyone else."
22737,"Nah, not so much. The odd traveler on the road. But mostly just old Fultheim, come to drink away a lifetime of bad memories, I'd wager."
22739,"This old place? Been here forever. Built by my great grandda. Run by him, then all the way up the line to me."
22740,You've got a lot of nerve. But not a lot of common sense.
22741,"He mostly just hangs about. Goes down to the lake, sometimes samples the stores of wine in the cellar. Man can do whatever he pleases, far as I care."
22742,No more.... No more!
22745,"Anything you need, just holler."
22748,This is for Haldyn!
22749,"Poor Roggi. If you're feeling charitable, buy the Nord a mead. He's good for it."
22751,You see any other inns around here? Where else would I go to drink?
22752,"Kind of sad, really."
22755,"A law made at the tip of an Aldmeri sword, aye. A sword stained red with Nord blood."
22756,"Either this is some kind of a joke, or you're keeping something from me."
22757,"Next time, you might want to get dressed before leaving the house."
22758,"Welcome to the Moorside. If you need anythin', I'll be 'round. Good to have a customer."
22759,Let's kill someone.
22763,I suppose it's time I gave him an answer...
22764,This is our stronghold. Leave.
22765,Ah yes.
22766,"He's still in town, getting by plying spells to the people inside the Frozen Hearth. Disgraceful."
22768,"But the truth of it is, I have a mountain of paperwork back in Windhelm and it's not getting any smaller."
22770,You want knives? You want them in your belly? No? Then you stop talking to Deeja.
22771,"Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that."
22772,"Now, back to the matter at hand."
22773,And what would you have me say? Sorry for following the misguided teachings of a mad Divine? Sorry for stealing memories from children?
22775,"Who in Dagon's name are you? Speak, or I'll cut you down where you stand."
22778,"Of course, here. Be well."
22779,I guess you had your reasons.
22783,"Well, well. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I've always got time for lovely ladies."
22784,She can't tell me what to do!
22788,"Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later, when you are ready."
22789,"When I became Steward, I had to give up the bottle. The people of the hold need me at my best."
22790,"And you are not alone. There are others. A child of night... a stalker of the sands? Oh, but before you are family, there will be blood. Such blood. "
22791,"But until that dragon's dealt with, Ulfric's just going to have to wait."
22792,I see... Give the papers to my Steward.
22793,That sounds good. I'm not sure the court will believe that Olaf had wizard powers but we shall see.
22794,I just can't wait to be a bride someday. Someday...
22795,"For now, give the papers to my Steward."
22796,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
22797,"Here. I had to use simple words, but this letter should convince Camilla it's from him."
22798,Ain't many visitors come to the dungeon. Every now and then Sybille Stentor will come by looking for... volunteers.
22803,Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes. 
22806,Good. Follow me. We have to fight our way up. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.
22808,Hmm... these are interesting reports...
22810,"Let's go, let's go!"
22811,But ten little cuts...
22813,"You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid..."
22814,"Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun..."
22816,There's bound to be resistance. There are many Stormcloak camps tucked away in the hills. 
22817,I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.
22818,"You are pleasant company, more than pleasant. And what about you? Would you... be interested in a life together?"
22819,"As in all things, Lord, caution... I urge us to wait and see."
22820,"Help... ? No, no! Look I didn't even know it was her until after she contacted me."
22822,I feel like I can beat anything.
22823,"Good job! With those Imperial scouts out of the way, I can be more aggressive about where I send our men."
22825,You plan to march on Windhelm?
22826,"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates."
22829,I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead...
22830,"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or to declare his intentions."
22831,He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!
22832,He'll do no such thing!
22834,He was rather straight forward with Torygg.
22835,Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!
22836,Pity no one told the Elves. Whole group of those Thalmor came and they demanded Ulfric's arrest.
22837,"That ""boy"" was High King of Skyrim."
22838,I owe a great deal of money to someone and I think they cheated me. I don't know what to do.
22839,"Though I suspect he'll prefer to send his ""Stormcloaks"" to do it for him."
22843,"If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the old way, let him. "
22844,You cannot even conceive of the power I wield...
22846,"One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind."
22847,"I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. "
22850,"You can try, but we've gotten nowhere talking to him ourselves."
22851,Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.
22852,"I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen..."
22853,Ruins ahead. Means old traps and bonewalkers.
22854,"Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric..."
22857,I worry that you've been spending too many nights out.
22859,"But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire."
22861,And what harm is there in letting a few legionnaires die in place of your own men?
22862,"No, no, no. I need this job! This is the last place in town to have work."
22865,"Yes, I'm a powerful wizard. No, I won't put on a magic show for you."
22866,It seems cowardly.
22867,"It's hard work keeping Solitude fed, but I wouldn't trust any other family to do it."
22868,As long as those orders came from Ulfric.
22870,Be seein' you around.
22873,"Yeah, that's what papa says too."
22874,This again?! That was different. Was Balgruuf given a chance to object? No. The Jarls weren't asked. He was told. And he had to like it.
22875,The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.
22881,Did you know Vittoria is the Emperor's cousin? Best stay on her good side.
22882,Ulfric is the one who has offended. 
22885,Illdi. What year did the Aldmeri Dominion invade the Empire?
22886,Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her?
22887,The milk drinkers in this town wouldn't last five minutes in a real battle.
22888,Damnit! This isn't about gold!
22890,"Not now. If I don't pull night duty, I'll drink a round with you at the Sleeping Giant."
22891,"Wait, come back!"
22892,You want another one of those?
22893,"Oh, he's serious. But so am I."
22895,Been on the river since I could walk. Wouldn't trade it for the world.
22897,"I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the esteemed Jarl of Windhelm."
22898,Come back when you figure out how to spend money.
22900,Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.
22901,One moment. But don't go far. I expect I'll need you.
22902, 
22903,"First, I need you to clear the main chamber of those monstrosities. I'll stay here until you're finished, planning our next move."
22907,"If he returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps it, then we are at peace."
22909,Ulfric will know my meaning.
22910,"There have been unconfirmed reports that someone has been sneaking into the town of Winterhold while invisible, and causing... issues."
22911,M'aiq wishes you well. 
22912,"Ah, but nobody wants that, right? Painful for you, annoying for me. So, you pay my fine... and you walk away."
22913,"Now that we've got that out of the way, I'll take everything you have... or your life."
22918,Good...
22919,"Help take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it."
22920,"What's this? If that oaf thinks all I'm going to do is stay in that filthy house of his and clean, I'll...."
22921,He stayed with us for decades... became an uncle of sorts to Aduri.
22922,Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment. 
22925,"Legion soldiers gleam like fresh-fallen snow and clank like a kitchen. They head this way, we'll know it."
22926,"Yes, to General Tullius. "
22928,Certainly isn't helping my business any; who'd want to rent a room anywhere near a haunted barrow?
22929,Is that so? I've been wondering when he'd come around.
22930,Master Borri has agreed to teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
22932,This is your last mistake!
22933,"May I just speak with her, please, to clear all this up?"
22934,"The College of Winterhold is an amazing sight. I've never set foot on the grounds, but always wanted to."
22935,Something's happening...
22936,"Leather? If they're armored, you should talk to Balimund over at The Scorched Hammer."
22940,I have nothing to say to that murderer.
22942,I got locked up one too many times. Now I'm in for life.
22945,Hope you're not getting too wet back there.
22947,Please! I'll pay you. I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't leave me here!
22948,"Another drink, Cosnach? A porter with Arnleif and Sons deserves nothing but the finest here."
22951,"I had hoped life would be simpler here, but war seems to find a way of following me."
22952,Sooner than you think.
22953,"Ask any fool around here, and get a different answer."
22955,"That's mighty bold, strutting about like that, looking for a fight. This one will oblige if he must."
22956,The Empire and the Jarls who back them must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.
22957,There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat without threshing the chaff.
22958,I must now show them the path that will lead us back to our strength.
22959,"I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk, it makes us weak. "
22961,That crown should be around here somewhere. Just keep an eye out for the bonewalkers...
22962,"You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you."
22963,We haven't caught anyone or anything yet. It's like it knows when I'm there.
22964,"Oh? True, I may meet my end in a dark alley with a dagger in my back. But the people have seen the truth, and they will not back down."
22966,Just because I don't fit in here is no reason for others to ridicule me behind my back.
22967,"Considering how the Great War ended, I think we need to be cautious about what we rely on."
22968,"You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?"
22969,"Watch yourself, these Nordic ruins are notorious for their traps."
22971,"Down with you, damned worm!"
22972,"It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child."
22974,"That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door, and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him inside."
22976,Bah. Another honest man lost in all this madness. And for what?
22977,I'll turn you back over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be with us all.
22980,"Hmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror of midnight. Sithis is all those things."
22982,You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response.
22983,"Of course not! Complacency is the bane of art. They're in good hands with you, Inge."
22985,Very funny. Did Enthir put you up to this?
22987,...I'll never do another span in that stinking jail... rather die than give myself up...
22989,Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!
22990,"Ah, yes. The entrance seems to be near what's now known as the Karthspire. We'll have to see what we find when we arrive."
22993,Wait. Are you... Are you serious?
22994,That's none of your business and I appreciate if you wouldn't mention it again.
22995,"An intelligent, beautiful woman like her wouldn't fall for that nonsense... I hope."
22996,"I knew I could count on you, soldier."
22999,But I don't want to be safe! I'm not afraid of the dangers out there. The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting my life on this farm.
23000,The Thalmor know how to deal with Talos worshippers.
23001,"This opens up entire new realms of research for us. Oh, if only Septimus were here to see this!"
23002,All this standing around is rubbish. We should be taking the fight to the Stormcloaks.
23003,We have been on our own for some time now. I fear we will not survive.
23006,Show respect while you're here and you and I will be fine.
23010,"Ah, Nana Ildene, whatever would my family do without you?"
23011,"You do not know of Malacath? He is the keeper of oaths, the master of curses."
23013,I heard about what you did. You hurt someone. Bad.
23014,Something I can get for ya?
23017,"He demands loyalty and strength from his orcs. We have tried to please him, but he is now angry with us, and so we suffer."
23019,Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild.
23020,But you might be able to butter them up enough to lower their guard.
23021,"If you need any more smithing work, come see me again."
23022,Give those pirates what for! 
23023,"If you wish to trade, see me during daylight."
23025,"Thank you for telling me the truth. You should speak to Sven. I'm sure he'll want to thank you, too, for defending his name."
23026,"He is quick to anger, and slow to forgive. One who wrongs Malacath is one who will endure great torment in return."
23027,"But, well... There is one more thing. If you're interested?"
23028,Weeks? Longer? It feels like an age has gone by. I haven't slept in so long.
23029,As you may know Talos worship is outlawed in the Empire.
23030,"Ataf, please play back that piece for me."
23031,"Look, I've seen one of the spirits with my very own eyes. When it glared at me, I swear it burned right through my soul."
23032,"Between you and I, I think his motivations are a bit more self-serving. He uses this holy war as leverage in order to pursue the throne."
23033,"Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do."
23034,"They say I'm just snooping around bothering people, but I'm trying to save lives!"
23035,Then I was wrong about him. 
23040,"The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground."
23041,I said move along. The Forsworn are just a bunch of madmen. We have everything under control. Stay out of it.
23043,"We've made you a fair offer. Are you serious about these talks, or are you just here to posture?"
23046,We never saw him again.
23047,"What say you, Dragonborn?"
23048,"One should never pay too much attention to rumors, Torbjorn."
23049,"Steady! Steady, now! Keep under cover until it's down!"
23051,"I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it."
23052,"Jorleif, I want you to send a messenger to our western camps."
23053,"Like anyone, a crisis will push them towards devotion. I've been seeing a lot of the Shatter-Shields, since they lost their daughter. "
23054,"About a year or two ago, some fella named Wyndelius came through; said he was some kind of a treasure hunter."
23055,"I am the Jarl of Markarth, now. The Silver-Blood family is finally where it should have always been."
23057,"Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride."
23059,It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.
23060, 
23061,I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!
23064,"If you give me a list, I'll have them delivered to the dock by tomorrow morning."
23066,"I surrender! Give me a few hours to gather my household, and I'll depart. You have my word."
23067,...I can't believe this...
23069,"If it's work you need, how about chopping up some wood for the fires?"
23070,Slow? No. It just ain't there at all.
23072,Did you know my father? He was really important. He even talked to the Jarl sometimes.
23073,I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?
23075,Everyone looked and no one could find her. Wilhelm said she'll be back... told Narfi not to worry... Reyda will come back.
23076,You... didn't mean... yourself. You meant... Pelagius...
23077,"Reyda was here, then gone. Went to gather plants and never came home... nope, nope."
23079,I don't want some snotty elf telling me what gods I can and can't worship. 
23081,It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
23082,"Makes Narfi very, very sad. Narfi needs Reyda to say goodbye."
23083,"That's it! Now, wait until he's well inside!"
23084,Will you be needing anything special today?
23085,With father I said goodbye... with mother I said goodbye. Reyda leaves and Narfi can't say goodbye.
23086,Don't patronize me!
23089,"Here's the payment for killing Alain. And nothing for letting Nilsine live. Just remember, that was your decision."
23090,He just keeps to himself in what's left of his folk's farmhouse across the river.
23091,He's harmless. He's been in a state ever since his sister Reyda disappeared over a year ago.
23096,But is it safe for you to be here? Won't the Imperials be looking for you?
23097,Enough! 
23098,"I tried to look for her, but she never turned up."
23099,That twisted jester will pay for what's he's done...
23101,Probably best if you avoid it for now... it didn't seem to do Reyda any good.
23102,"I've seen some sort of a cave entrance over there. Folks call it ""Geirmund's Hall,"" but I don't know why."
23104,"Sorry, I need to pay attention so I can remember this."
23108,Excellent! Sorry it didn't work out with you and your lady. I know how excited you were for the wedding.
23111,"Oh no! No, no, no. Narfi never got to say goodbye! Now Narfi's all alone."
23112,Come! Come and see what goods I offer.
23114,"Well, you see, that's a little complicated, and... you know what? Never mind. Guess I'm not retiring anytime soon."
23115,Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that.
23119,"Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good."
23120,"But that was a great many years ago, before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely."
23121,The Greybeards? What do those old hermits want with me?
23124,Tell you what. Bring me ten of their pelts from anywhere in Skyrim I'll gladly pay you for thinning out the herd.
23126,Are you kidding? Those damn things will drive me right out of business!
23131,"You get a generous amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die."
23132,Nice to finally meet someone who can follow simple instructions.
23134,I sell all sorts of poisons for almost every occasion.
23137,It's getting to the point where I have to scour Skyrim for untouched trees at the right size. Costs me too much time and money.
23139,"But not all of them, because some of them are still here."
23142,This is how the Empire repays us for our loyalty?
23143,"By Talos, the stones on this one! You're in no position to dictate terms to us, Tullius!"
23144,It's strange holding a hilt that isn't connected to a dagger. Oh well.
23148,"Yes, my lord."
23149,"Harbinger, I'd be honored if you joined me in my search."
23150,Vahrukt unslaad... perhaps none but me now remember how he was defeated.
23151,I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...
23155,That didn't take long.
23157,All right. I wrote down the last place I'd heard about. Don't get killed.
23159,"Hear, hear!"
23160,Yes!
23161,"Well, isn't this a surprise!"
23162,Diplomatic as usual.
23163,She's part of the Imperial delegation. You can't dictate who I bring to this council.
23164,"Some other time? That's not going to help me much, now is it?"
23165,Stormcloaks! Get them!
23166,"Gretta, Engar, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Imperial reinforcements taking us by surprise."
23170,You didn't die. A battle you live through is a great honor.
23172,Mighty decent of you.
23173,"But mom, it's so boring with just me and Torom. I was just asking Skaggi some questions."
23174,You've got some nerve.
23175,He has something special planned for you. Better talk to him.
23176,But I thought you only cared about your fishing!
23181,"But they also stole Finn's Lute. We just learned where the bandits fled to, and I very much want that lute back."
23184,"If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get."
23185,"Secondly, we got a couple of Imperial spies roaming through the hold. Need to put an end to that."
23186,Ha ha ha ha ha!
23188,We're taking Whiterun. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
23192,"Many thanks. And please, take this gift. I hope it's a fitting token to honor the deed."
23195,"Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes."
23197,Finn was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today.
23199,This is only a taste of the benefits that accrue to those that align themselves with Thalmor interests.
23200,I'm surprised that the College is allowed to excavate here.
23201,"In Morthal, there is little to rule. But there is much to teach. And so, I am Jarl."
23202,It makes me sad whenever I think about it.
23204,The captain inherited the Sea Squall from his mother when she died. Maybe I can inherit the ship if he dies...
23205,"I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone!"
23206,"Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly."
23207,I assure you that we mean you no harm.
23209,What? You did? Oh sweet Divines! You did!
23213,This place reeks of gray-skin filth!
23214,Well don't just stand there. Go get my flute!
23215,Get out.
23217,"Aye, that I do. Have all my life. We Battle-Borns have been here since the beginning. Along with the Gray-Manes."
23218,I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for seventeen generations!
23219,Larina. That fool student of mine stole my flute and sold it to some necromancer.
23221,I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for the Winterhold wizards.
23222,"Perhaps... I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare. But I'm warning you, if this turns out to be a waste of time and men..."
23225,Why are you here? Did you follow me?
23226,You work the forge.
23231,"I've been trained as a skald, as was my father, and my father's father before him."
23232,"You're not supposed to play with fire, you know."
23233,It wasn't long before we lost what we depend on to survive... respect.
23234,Apparently Larina told him some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance.
23236,Don't let it get you down. Indaryn will eventually tire of picking on you and move on to someone else.
23237,"Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there."
23238,"They represent the reason I'm here. I can't just ignore them, Aerin."
23240,"Boethiah talks about leaving your mark, a sign of your passing.... Well, you can make a mark on the world without treachery and murder."
23241,"Ah, hello my good friend. Would you do me a kindness? I seem to be down to my last drop of spirits. Let me tell you, sobriety is highly overrated."
23242,"Yes, and I couldn't tell you why."
23243,So many refuse to talk to us. They call us thieves and smugglers. I am glad to see that you are not such a one.
23245,Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. That was the missing clue.
23246,"When you disrespect your Family, you disrespect yourself. Don't you care for anything at all? Prove that you do - speak with Nazir, make reparations."
23247,What? The Emperor? But I...
23249,Only in that I'm a graduate. I work at here at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
23250,"You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least."
23251,"You must be new around here. Bad manners to ask such a direct question, at one of Elenwen's little soirees."
23253,The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.
23255,"Bandits harass the caravans at every step, but Khajiit usually scare them off."
23257,"One of them stole my Moon Amulet, given to me by my mother when I was just a cub. It is my only memory of home in this cold land."
23260,"A few days ago, we were ambushed. A nuisance, really, but many of the marauders had quick fingers."
23262,"Don't let them intimidate you, sister. We both know how to keep our heads while the men let their hearts rule."
23264,Did you learn anything useful?
23266,"Alain made all the pain just... go away. But it was all lies! Alain used me. He ruined my name, destroyed my friendship with the Shatter-Shields..."
23267,We don't stand a chance!
23268,Here to dig. That's all.
23270,"It's an honor to see you, the keeper of Namira's ring."
23271,"I'm worried about Idgrod, and I don't know what to do."
23275,"If you ever need the skills of a Khajiit warrior by your side, I would be honored to travel with you."
23276,There it is. Ah.... Home....
23279,"What would you have me do? If we do not send men to fight in the war, you'll find yourself guarding one of Ulfric's men."
23280, 
23281,I'm not so certain that Ulfric's intentions are as noble as they think. I think Ulfric cares about Ulfric and the rest is a smokescreen.
23283,You should never have come here!
23284,I am buying a fish for Noster. He likes fish.
23288,Any progress on finding the mask?
23290,Excellent.
23292,He's Solitude's priest of Arkay. He's the one who figured out Potema was still around. He'll help as much as he can.
23295,"This is our stronghold. Here, we are free to live as Malacath intended, away from the prying eyes of the Nords."
23296,"Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?"
23297,I trust his judgment on this. As a priest of Arkay he's had to deal with necromancy before. Nothing as dangerous as Potema though.
23301,I'm not really sure. Styrr thinks you have some sort of link to Potema.
23302, 
23303,"Every other day, seems one of the laborers runs off in the hills saying he'll join the Forsworn."
23304,I think I see what I was doing wrong...
23305,"What do you think, genius?"
23306,Taking on Potema won't be easy. But you are the one to do it.
23307,Good luck. I'm counting on you.
23308, 
23310,"Oh, I thought that matter was handled. I think Falk is taking care of that."
23311,"I will do nothing of the sort. You have no business here. I'm sorry, but you really must leave."
23313,Court is in session.
23314,And then we were all fighting just to survive. None of us were prepared. It was amazing the rest of us survived.
23315,You want me to smile? What's there to smile about? Soldiers and dragons are going to be trampling all over the crops this year. I just know it.
23316,"Ah yes, good idea. Best to let a professional businessman handle that money for you."
23318,"Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up."
23319,"Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. Looks like he really did it!"
23320,I better get back to cleaning the store. What a mess.
23321,"Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin, wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal! "
23322,Please don't interrupt the court.
23324,Oh. Um. Well... You see...
23325,Raagghh!
23329,"When we are done with that, we will take our army to the Dominion, and show those pointy-eared bastards not every man is fit to be their slave."
23332,Keep in song in your heart to ward off the gloom.
23333,Come on!
23334,Ah! Damn wizard. Keep your spells off of me. 
23335,I'm glad you'll be with me in there. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
23336,"No need to explain, I'm well aware of your Guild's methods."
23339,"Be safe, traveler."
23340,I've got one all saddled up for you! What do you figure she's worth?
23341,"Olaf returned in triumph to Whiterun. By his decree, the city's keep was rebuilt as a prison for Numinex."
23342,Why are you stopping?
23343,"Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that's burning your farms and killing your sons."
23344,We served our time in the Legion. Now we're just trying to make it day to day.
23345,Mind what you say! The Empire has ears all over this town.
23346,Make Laelette go away!
23347,Stendarr's Light purify you of your ills.
23348,"There were six of us. Full of ambition, eager to conquer the world."
23350,(Deep exhale)
23351,I get to help mother with the shop. I used to help papa too... 'till I tried to use the forge...
23353,Good to talk to you.
23354,"My spies report the Jarl's Steward, Anuriel, has arrangements with the Thieves Guild that would be rather embarrassing if made public."
23355,The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.
23356, 
23358,We'll all meet Arkay sooner or later. Best to enjoy the time we've got.
23359,Speak to Vex. We have nothing else to talk about.
23361,"Life is far too short, my friend. Don't waste it!"
23364,"I told you, I don't know anything else about it."
23365,Out of my way.
23369,"You hear any juicy gossip in town, be sure to share it with me!"
23370,"Steal anything from my shop, and you'll regret it."
23371,"Kust is my assistant. He helps me tend the headstones and keep our cemetery clean, as befits a place of rest."
23372,Of course. Something that seems to be in short supply these days.
23373,I'm just here to work the mine. Nothing else matters anymore.
23374,"Oh, merciful Arkay, no! I am too old and frail, and this graveyard is too large."
23379,"Rjorn's drum! Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be."
23380,"Considering most of us are now dead, I assumed as much."
23382,"Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of the Nord heroes -- this is the Akaviri symbol for ""Shout."""
23383,"After each battle, more dead were buried, and the graveyard got bigger. I've heard it's now the biggest graveyard in Skyrim."
23388,"I'm no scholar, but I know that a lot of battles have been fought here over the course of history."
23389,The cemetery is ancient. It's been here longer than the town.
23391,"Those true sons and daughters of Skyrim will never cease to worship mighty Talos. If we cannot do so in our temples, we will do so in our hearts."
23393,Enough to know that it's not worth it.
23394,Hey! You planning to steal something? Don't even think about it.
23395,Door's over there. Why don't you use it?
23397,"Later, ham hock."
23398,"They just call themselves the people of the Reach. Lot of common blood with the Bretons, by the looks of them."
23401,"I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that, it's hard to say."
23402,"Before we get down to business, I've got something I need you to do."
23403,The only thing we're lacking is a reliable way to transport our merchandise across Skyrim.
23404,"Malur, I need you to take care of something."
23412,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
23414,"Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you."
23418,Wow. Nice weapon! Can I hold it? I promise not to break anything. Honest!
23420,It's an illegal substance highly favored by the Khajiit. Very difficult to come by.
23421,Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot?
23425,"You approach as if you know us, stranger. Who are you and what do you want?"
23426,"Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk."
23428,Sometimes it pays to look in every nook and cranny.
23429,"My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps as a hunter, but I set my aspirations a bit higher. He never complained... I miss him."
23430,"Before you even ask, yes I have an ancestry steeped in magic, and no I don't want to talk about it."
23431,"Patience, Illdi. We study the heroes of the past so we can have better understanding of the heroes of today... and tomorrow."
23432,They say there's nothing a Nord woman can't do if she puts her mind to it.
23434,"No, no. Sorry if I sounded so mean there. My brother always said I have a big mouth."
23437,"Ah, Moon Sugar. I could smell it on you. I'm pleased with this offer, and accept."
23440,"Good job. Here, let me give you something for all the leg work."
23441,"Good, I'll contact some of my people and have them prepare some shipments right away."
23443,Very good. I'll see that this is put towards getting things back to normal.
23446,Did Ri'saad accept our offer?
23447,"Was there anything else, or is our transaction complete?"
23448,You'll find Ri'saad with his caravan group. Just don't do anything stupid when you get there.
23449,Who do you think's killed more Imperials? You? Or me?
23450,Give my regards to Tonilia. Tell her I'll contact her soon.
23451,"Quickly, follow me!"
23453,Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?
23454,"Skyrim isn't very friendly for Argonians, so we mostly just keep out of the way."
23455,"The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me!"
23456,We should get after Vals Veran before he does more damage here.
23457,It's just up here.
23458,"Oh, stop apologizing. It makes you look like an idiot. Learn to talk back a bit, girl! Why, when I was in the temple...."
23459,I'll tell you more about it when we are nearby.
23460,"Thank you. I'll look these over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant. "
23461,"Mara's mercy! A dragon... in Helgen? Why, it could be here at any moment!"
23462,Thanks again for your help.
23464,Thank you. The pain is already easing.
23466,"My joints ache, I can't eat nothin' and my head feels like a furnace. I've seen better days."
23468,I'll see you there.
23470,"I still can't hold nothin' down, but it's better than yesterday."
23471,I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.
23473,"The fever's down a bit, an' I can almost see straight."
23474,Eorlund Gray-Mane's a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor.
23475,Some people can't be trusted to accomplish anything that's asked of them. They don't take pride in their work.
23480,"The pain's a little less than before, but it still hurts bad enough."
23481,"Yes, yes, as you've said, countless times before..."
23482,Let's go.
23483,"Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim."
23485,Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.
23486,"Did you hear that? A metal on stone sound... hmmm, perhaps it was nothing."
23487,What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?
23489,You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text.
23490,"There could be Draugr about, I can smell the decay in the air."
23491,"Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts."
23492,Say you're sorry. Say it now.
23493,Why do they call it Left Hand Mine? Can the miners use their right hands too?
23494,Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.
23495,"Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research."
23496,"Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable..."
23498,"Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back."
23499,Again!
23501,"By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over!"
23502,Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.
23503,You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not Tacitus.
23507,Farengar!
23508,Come on! Let's see you put up a fight!
23509,"Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. "
23510,"Well, I just never expected the Gourmet to be a Breton. It almost seems too obvious. Some of the greatest cooks have been Bretons, and..."
23511,"I hear there's been fighting in Skyrim. Rebellion, maybe. Wonder if our iron is being used for weapons."
23512,You're nothing but trouble.
23517,"Dragons are coming back, and you're a born dragonslayer. That's all you need to know right now."
23518,"See if you can't ""convince"" one of those innkeepers to help you."
23520,"Soon, I will be of age. The taste is bitter."
23521,"My friend Olava? The seer? She says things will get better for me, once I start sticking up for myself."
23522,Thanks. Couldn't have done that without you.
23523,Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.
23524,Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed.
23526,"Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution."
23527,"What do you want, Imperial? Ain't my life hard enough?"
23530,"So, uh... how is Astrid doing' these days? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up."
23531,"So, feeling loose? How about you run a job for me."
23533,"I'm not half the wizard my uncle was, but I still have a few spells worth buying."
23535,I need you to retrieve the poem.
23536,Good talking to you. Not many care to chat with the help.
23537,Ru...Maar!
23540,Get me out of here!
23542,Hey!
23543,Last but not least. Let's go!
23544,All right!
23549,Thanks!
23550,Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.
23552,"Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and she deserves better."
23553,You would violate this marvel of Kynareth's glory to fix that half-breed stump in Whiterun?
23554,If only we knew where she was...
23556,But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
23558,They promise people they'll kill off all the Nords that rule over the Reach. Nothing but murderers and saboteurs.
23559,I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.
23560,Oblivion take them. Every miserable last one of them.
23561,Rikke. You don't have to do this.
23562,"The Empire has agreed to accept our beliefs, and its citizens have a responsibility to cease their heretical worship."
23563,"Yes and no. Viik nuz ni kron. Alduin was not truly defeated, either. If he was, you would not be here today, seeking to... defeat him."
23564,Aren't you already running a job for Aela? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
23567,"There may be a way out, down this way."
23569,"If trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becomes a burden, and you find yourself in Winterhold, visit me at the College."
23571,"Have a client lookin' to have a rival's business ledger changed. Don't know the reason, and don't want to know. Count you in?"
23572,"Come now, my friend. Haven't we played this game long enough? Untie me, and we can all go our separate ways."
23574,"I used to run with them myself, but took a job with Maven after they started hittin' a rough patch."
23575,"Have you learned nothing from us? Would you simply be a tool in the hands of the Blades, to be used for their own purposes?"
23576,"I promise you, I buy much more than simple silver trinkets."
23577,"Glad your here, I've been looking for some more merchandise to buy. Have lots of orders to fill and my clients don't like to wait."
23578,Come and visit me in Solitude sometime.
23579, 
23582,"Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?"
23584,"No. No, I'm quite sure I have no idea what you're talking about."
23585,The only reason I'm here is because my refusal to attend would cause a diplomatic incident.
23587,Let's see what you have for me today. Something simple to turn around for a profit I trust.
23588,You little thief!
23589,"If you've got the time to sell, I've got the time to buy."
23590,"Be sure and investigate Radiant Raiment's fine selection of clothing. We have many items you'll fancy, I'm sure."
23593,Excuse me.
23594,"In trouble with the Guild, eh? Well, looks like we won't be trading merchandise until you smooth it over."
23595,"So, did Delvin send you again or you here on your own this time?"
23596,Thank you.
23597,These bastards call themselves Imperial Legionnaires...
23598,"But what you seek does not come easily, and can destroy those without a strong will."
23599,"I'm not sure. At first they accused me of being a Stormcloak, a secret Talos worshipper..."
23601,I saw Caius.. that dragon just grabbed him and... I don't know how I made it out of there...
23603,You're right. It's mine. 
23608,I told you what you wanted to know. What else could you want?
23609,What brings you to Whiterun? Got some juicy goods to sell?
23610,A group of them has holed up in the Pale.
23612,"Not well. He's convinced that his house is haunted, so he's sleeping on the street."
23613,I have several elixirs for sale.
23615,Brought me more than some Firebrand Wine I trust?
23616,"If it puts your mind at ease, I'll take it with me. I'm sorry."
23618,"Ah, you're back. I'm hearing good things about the Guild through the grapevine."
23620,"Come to sell me something special, or did you just want to look through my merchandise?"
23621,"And indeed, there are many that call us heroes."
23622,"Ah, you're just in time. I got in a shipment of fine wares courtesy of the East Empire Company."
23623,For the Empire!
23624,Are you enjoying the party?
23625,Hurry back... and bring more merchandise.
23627,Give my regards to Karliah if you see her.
23628,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
23629,I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he is.
23630,"I am the Jarl's Steward. If you have court business to tend to, you talk to me."
23632,"Do me a favor. If you speak to Maven, tell her everything's well at hand down here, okay?"
23634,"Mara, I forgot how late it was. We'll need to lock up the shop."
23635,You're the brute that hurt me before.
23636,"I... I don't know why I pressed the others on, convinced them to keep going."
23640,"Back to the time when a king was a king because his enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him. "
23641,"Everything seems to be working out nicely, wouldn't you agree?"
23642,"Years of work, finally going to pay off..."
23643,"There's been no word from the remnants of the Summerset Shadows, so I'm assuming you either eliminated all of them or they've fled Skyrim."
23644,How come you're in Winterhold? My pa says people like you are the reason no one lives here anymore.
23645,"Plus, the meadery's doing so well, I'm almost having trouble keeping up with the demand."
23646,How could I complain when I went from Sabjorn's lackey to one of the wealthiest merchants in Whiterun in no time at all?
23648,"Best of all, there's no need to smuggle things quietly anymore. With the influence we have in Solitude, I can march it right out the front door."
23651,I will be waiting at Reachcliff.
23652,A Thane of Riften is expected to maintain permanent residence within the city walls.
23653,We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.
23654,"I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard."
23656,"From the look of it, I'd bet it leads straight into the prison."
23658,"But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back."
23659,I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
23661,There's a grate outside the wall. Looks like it used to be buried in snow. I don't think they know it's there.
23662,Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
23663,"Hey, welcome to the mill!"
23667,"I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard."
23668,"We found a cave under the lake. With luck, it'll lead into the prison."
23670,"Frankly, whoever keeps taking them down should get a medal."
23671,"Have you spoken to the Temple of Mara, yet? I'm so excited."
23673,"But, if you find more trouble than you can handle, run out to the courtyard. We'll come as soon as we hear fighting."
23675,Then you've salted it and nothing will grow at all. Genius.
23676,I have faith in you.
23680,"I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics."
23681,I can't get it open.
23682,"Sorry, my ears aren't so good. You say somethin'?"
23683,"Those thieves must be mad, hiding out there. Those old crypts are filled with nothing but traps, trolls, and who knows what else!"
23684,"What could be more important than hearing the prayers of the faithful, and answering the questions of the dedicated?"
23685,"Right, right... Oh, look at that. I seem to have lost my keys. Might take me a while to find them."
23687,Enough! Stop!
23690,And here we all are. Shall we step inside?
23691,And it isn't just the dark elves they hate -- they make a target of the Argonians as well.
23692,Nothing would please me more. I'll keep their eyes away while you do what you came here for.
23693,"And yet you have done my bidding. Why, I wonder?"
23694,Some of these Nords will come up with any excuse to despise us.
23696,"You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for."
23698,"If you find Staubin, it would be good to see any notes he may have collected. I doubt you'll find him alive, though."
23699,"Oh really? Hmm... this looks like someone from Staubin's little group. A brave scholar, but not very wise...."
23700,And would you raise your sword in his honor?
23702,I haven't heard even a scratch at the door. Have you done it?
23704,"Here, I usually pay researchers for their work when they emerge from the ruins, but they won't be needing it anymore."
23705,Are you looking for help with something? This is a busy time.
23707,"Unfortunately, sometimes the stone of scholarship is built on the foundation of death. I'll inform the kin."
23710,"Ah, you have returned. How goes the task I gave you?"
23715,I mean it! I'll... I'll cut you in half!
23716,"Yes, just this morning. It was from Logrolf. He wrote to thank us for the food we sent."
23718,You the sneaky type? Got some nice daggers around here somewhere...
23720,"And that we were sworn to protect the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer of all."
23724,You were given this gift by the gods for a reason. It is up to you to figure out how best to use it.
23726,We face the world together now. Where should we live? My home is yours.
23727,"We taught that dragon not to mess with Whiterun, didn't we?"
23729,"Then we stood and fought, our shield-wall defending until by dawn's light the Legion's ranks wavered."
23730,I hope you will find a warmer welcome in your travels than we have found in ours.
23731,"Now, if were done being sentimental, it's time for you to take the Oath."
23735,One small detail though - I need all of the gold they gave you. No one skims around here. Come back when you've got every last coin.
23736,I hope that you will come to do business with us again.
23737,"Hey now, you be careful with that fire."
23741,"He wants the city this badly, he can fight me for it."
23742,"I'm afraid ""acceptable"" just isn't acceptable anymore. I'm sure they can spare a few more coins in monthly rent."
23744,Are we running low on mead?
23747,Just stay away from me and maybe I won't weave a spell to shrink something that matters to you.
23750,"Oh my, how wonderful! Lady Mara will be so pleased!"
23752,What do you want? You have no business being in here!
23754,"You mean the official sort of business? Hmm, well... no. No, not really."
23755,"The dragons and the war have scared many other traders away, but for those with courage, there is much profit to be made."
23756,"I guess we also owe you something for locking you up. Here, my family's ring. And everything the guards confiscated from you."
23757,"The wise trader finds the best opportunities, even if he must travel far to find them. Skyrim is a ripe opportunity indeed."
23758,"An astute question, for we are far from home and this is a cold, hard land."
23759,What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises?
23762,"When they look upon us, they see only pickpockets and skooma dealers. It is most unfair, but we do our best to ignore them."
23765,I seem to have an unfortunate talent for getting myself involved in misunderstandings with the law.
23766,"Get out of our city, gray-skins! This is Nord land!"
23767,"Not long, in truth. I came to Skyrim after I found myself unwelcome in both Elsweyr and Cyrodiil."
23768,They're in! Don't let them gain further ground!
23771,You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick?
23773,The Bunkhouse isn't an inn. I'd recommend the Bee and Barb.
23774,"I say this without bitterness, for it was Ri'saad who saved me from a life of servitude aboard a trading ship."
23776,I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim.
23777,"I don't mean to do this to myself, but I can't help it. I tried some skooma a year ago, and ever since then, I can't stop!"
23778,You don't have to say sorry to me. I just hope the Eight bring us more peace in the future.
23781,"Long ago, I was an orphan on the streets of Corinthe. I stowed away aboard a trade ship that brought me here. It was Ri'saad who found me."
23782,Thanks for talking to me.
23784,Ain't every day we get visitors in Riverwood.
23788,"It was Ri'saad's idea to come here now, while the land is in turmoil. Where others saw only danger, he saw opportunity."
23789,"The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means."
23791,"I think, given the state of Skyrim, some might disagree."
23793,Vampire!
23794,"You asked for my help. Not for nothing, I hope?"
23795,Don't play stupid. I said turn out your pockets... now!
23796,And would you raise a mug in her name?
23797,I will end you!
23799,"If they just snuck out of town together, I could manage my husband. "
23801,I'm listenin'.
23803,"Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?"
23804,"Your skin's as pale as the snow. You scared of sunlight, or something?"
23805,Wizard tricks! An Orc faces the enemy. He doesn't hide from him.
23806,"If you head straight west from where the White River splits towards Whiterun, you can get a look at the Cradlecrush giants."
23808,I wish Elgrim had spent more time tutoring me then that Ingun girl.
23809,I believe you have a delivery to make.
23810,"Ah, good to see you, sister. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed."
23813,You want to talk to the King in Rags? Fine. But first you got to pay the toll.
23815,I'm afraid that's impossible.
23816,You're not a threat... merely an annoyance.
23817,I've been trying to figure out what makes Riften mead better than the stuff from Whiterun.
23820,There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor.
23821,Nocturnal will feed upon your soul!
23822,Yes mother? What is it?
23823,"Keep your weapon out of your hands, and we'll get along just fine."
23824,Thank you. The pain is already easing.
23825,So far so good.
23826,"The way they walk, what they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway."
23827,Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. Your best and least painful course of action is to apologize and promise to leave my family in peace.
23828,"Let's get out of here, for pity's sake!"
23829,Someone's got to head out there and take care of the beasts.
23830,You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.
23833,I don't see the relevance.
23836,"This is your last warning, outsider. We keep the peace, here. Stay out of our business."
23837,"Tell me, do you believe in mighty Arkay, god of life and death?"
23838,Now you die!
23839,Like I said. Hagraven.
23840,"I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but if you want to clear out the cave, I'll make sure you're repaid for your work."
23841,"Well, yes. Two of them. But you're reaching the end of what I have available."
23842,"There's one out on the road. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company."
23845,It's a smart man that demands something up front for his work. Some gold now and some when I have my dog. Here's the meat.
23846,I don't miss home one bit. I'm glad to leave that life behind me.
23847,His name's Bolund. He's the one who works the lumber mill down by the river.
23848,"My mother's been haunting me ever since she died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad she's here."
23849,Damnable jester...
23852,Now... what did you say you wanted?
23854,"Please, leave me alone. I need to be by myself."
23855,"Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need to pay you something for the goods."
23856,Speak to Filnjar in Shor's Stone. He's got some sort of ore sample he wants us to identify and was willing to pay us well for it.
23857,It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.
23860,Let's make the exchange.
23861,Have you... gone... completely... mad?
23862,"Ha! You've done it! Got to admit, I wasn't sure you could pull it off. But you've definitely earned your pay."
23863,But you won't get any better than this from me.
23864,"Why did you... nevermind, it's a sign. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your help."
23869,"I work silver, like my father, and his father before him."
23873,This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No.
23875,"He's had some troubles in his life, but I can't have him drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin he owes."
23876,"Thankfully Faleen is not quite his type, but they've been friends for some time, and he may have some ideas."
23877, 
23878,Cave up ahead. Trouble or maybe treasure?
23881,I'm married to Thonar Silver-Blood. Keep that in mind while you're speaking to me.
23885,Not just anyone is allowed inside. Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic.
23887,"Woah, woah. Calm down. Let's just think about this for a moment."
23888,"I'll think on this, but I make no promises."
23889,"Trust is always difficult, especially for my people. Yet we must trust in Tullius' leadership. For what other choice do we have?"
23890,"I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse."
23892,I hope that someday this city will be free from corruption and we can all live in peace.
23893,There's so much to learn about the shop. I'll never get it all straight.
23894,People say there's a man wandering the streets near the Blue Palace. He seems distressed but he's not making any sense.
23896,Vampire! To arms!
23899,Not lately. Business has been slow.
23901,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
23902,You call yourself a wizard? I challenge you to a duel!
23903,Takes coin to pay a fine. And you don't have enough.
23904,What's this nonsense? Bah.
23905,Done. Convince him to stay out of the city while you're at it.
23906,Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
23907,I'm sorry. I don't think I can bare to sell anything right now.
23909,No. She's such a nice woman. Comes by every day looking for jewelry for her family in Cyrodiil. Is it because she's a noble?
23914,"As Riften's Steward I'm afraid I can provide only limited assistance, but speak your mind."
23916,"You'll find that in his office, in the Legion stronghold of Dragon Bridge. It's your choice. Now go, and may Sithis speed you. "
23920,"Thane Bryling, at your service."
23922,"The Empire, in its wisdom, has come to recognize Talos worship as a barbaric remnant of a bygone age."
23923,I don't know. Rumor has it that she was murdered... butchered by a madman. I really try and stay out of such things.
23924,"Here it comes again. Not happy with a roof and a trade, no. You want to be something entirely... different."
23927,I must return to Markarth.
23930,You. Weapon. Put it away. Now.
23931,Who sent you? Was it the College? The Jarl? We agreed there would be no more questions.
23932,"Oh, of course, the poor girl who was murdered. Such a beautiful young thing... a tragedy to be certain."
23933,Get her!
23934,Fjotli...  Fjotli... Where have I heard that name?
23935,"Well... when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're talking about."
23936,"Yes, I think you'll be just what I need. "
23937,Are you out of your mind?
23938,You're accusing me of taking part such a... such a... heinous act? I should have you arrested for even suggesting such a thing!
23939,I serve my chief and my brothers by working in the mines. It's the only place fit for an aging Orc.
23940,You. I've seen you snooping around. Asking questions.
23941,"Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first."
23942,"Now that's the real question, isn't it? Because honestly, how much time off could a demented Daedra really need?"
23944,"Everyone, inside. Now!"
23947,Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?
23948,How dare you!
23949,"Don't bother, Clavicus won't talk to me."
23951,Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
23952,You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of threat.
23953,Of course you do.
23954,"To be honest, I doubt someone would be stupid enough to make an attempt on Maven... sorry, Jarl Maven's life."
23958,"Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people."
23961,"You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back."
23963,Imperials! Kill them!
23964,"Look, I had no choice. They're crazy... I could be killed!"
23965,But mother says you're a terrible innkeeper!
23967,I can't believe Fastred's gone. I... I should have been nicer to her.
23968,"Their leader, Linwe, he's the worst of the lot. He steals valuables from the dead."
23971,I used to fence for the Thieves Guild in Skyrim a long time ago.
23976,"After you're done with all this, come back anytime, and I'll make good on my end of the bargain."
23977,"In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic."
23979,"I never would have suspected that the Eye could be so dangerous. Tolfdir is right, isn't he? Magic really can overwhelm you."
23980,"Linwe is holed up at a place called Uttering Hills Cave. He's got his entire Guild there, so be careful."
23982,"Still, I'm surprised you haven't heard of Ulfric. He's our leader - the leader of the Stormcloaks."
23983,This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!
23986,"Forgive me, Ambassador. I allowed this... fool to provoke me. The fault is mine. There is no need for further disruption on my account."
23987,What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?
23988,"Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people."
23990,Anybody there?
23991,I'm guessing you're the newcomer then?
23992,"When the Skeleton Key was stolen from the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed."
23994,"It's wonderful to be able to sleep soundly, don't you think?"
23995,"That's no small amount of coin, friend."
23996,The Gray Quarter's a disgrace. Them dark elves live like animals.
23997,We've heard rumors of death and... and fire from the skies. But no real news.
23998,"Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this... violation of all our traditions."
23999,The World-Eater is dead! The way is now clear!
24000,Maybe she's looking for something to eat?
24001,I cannot tell you in detail. I never heard it used. Kogaan. It was the first Thu'um created solely by mortals.
24002,You needed to know more?
24003,Yeah. You beat people up.
24005,"Conquering paranoia should be a snap after that ordeal, hmm?"
24006,"Well! Same congratulations apply! Just, you know, for what you did for the insane emperor. "
24007,You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved themselves in political affairs.
24010,"But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where."
24012,"Krosis. Sorrowfully, no. It cannot be known to me."
24013,But you're not done yet. And you could still die...
24015,Mortal? Insufferable.
24017,"If you can... I want you to kill someone else, as well. You don't have to - not as part of our deal. But if you do... I'll pay you even more."
24018,"Just like old times, huh Horik? You and me fighting in a war over some forsaken scrap of land."
24019,"Without the Lighthouse, the Icerunner will have swung wide of the western shoal and run aground on the eastern coast."
24021,Brrrr... Chilly.
24023,"Um... We're not talking about Barbas, are we? Clavicus Vile's... dog? Oohh... awkward."
24024,"Ah! Good, good! No more barking at all hours, and chewing up my slippers. You used the hemlock, then? Damned good idea! I..."
24025,Of course. I rented a bed there. Where else would I sleep?
24026,You found what?
24028,"The timid warrior and the sly Khajiit. Must have been one or the other, right?"
24029,"I'm not angry with you. Tell you what, lover. Meet me in my chambers later and we can discuss the situation in private."
24030,I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in  the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. 
24032,"Oh, it's you. I didn't expect to see you again."
24034,"Excellent. I'd suggest that we go retrieve it immediately, but right now we have more pressing matters."
24037,"Yes, well, see that you keep at it. That is all."
24038,Come back and see us again.
24039,He opened a gate and the wrong man rode out of it. If that man hadn't been Ulfric Stormcloak. If Ulfric hadn't killed High King Torygg...
24041,Hjalti? I've never heard of anyone named Hjalti. Tiber Septim had many names. Maybe that's one of them?
24043,"If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me."
24044,"Of course, not as many pilgrims these days."
24046,Do not try to hide from me.
24048,"Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. They built the temple."
24049,"What do you want, milk drinker?"
24050,"A few decades ago, this place was as busy as the Imperial City. Now, you're lucky if you don't trip over a skeever instead."
24051,This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
24052,Is it true? One of the Psijics was here in the College?
24054,"This is the Temple of Kynareth. The Gildergreen, outside, was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun."
24055,"Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection."
24057,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Winterhold."
24058,"Yeah, rub it in. Just imagine what I could get done with my full power and none of these pesky ""morals."""
24060,You've actually done it. You've found the Sybil of Dibella. You have done Markarth a tremendous service. 
24062,There it is again. Did you hear that?
24064,"How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you."
24066,"Check every crate, chest and barrel you see. Who knows, maybe a few of them have something valuable inside."
24071,"And truth be told, since Torygg's death, he had no real power in court. But still... He didn't deserve to die."
24072,"Carry on, Lonely-Gale. And loosen yourself a bit."
24073,"Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol."
24074,I'll bring a blanket and some wine.
24075,"I have a necklace that would look lovely on you, or on a... special someone."
24077,"All lovely young ladies, too. Let's hope the guards find that demon soon, and introduce him to the headsman's axe."
24078,You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that damn treaty was the day the Empire died. 
24080,"All right, you've had enough."
24082,"I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, we could wake up its child."
24083,"Not much. But as a bard, I find the whole affair depressing."
24084,"My shipmates scoff at my love of finery, but I know envy when I hear it."
24085,"And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at the end of a blade."
24086,"Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better. "
24088,"You... You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place?"
24089,"You tell him that jester is up to no good, and he'll deal with it. Then come back here, and I'll toss a few coins your way, yeah?"
24090,You have yourself a bet.
24092,He even stole that locket right off that poor murdered girl's body... or what was left of it.
24093,Do come back.
24095,Why? We had a deal Madanach. A deal!
24096,Apparently some Nord women were murdered. Not sure why I should care.
24098,"It's called ""Nettlebane."" The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself."
24100,You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Spriggans. 
24101,Are we ready to proceed?
24103,"Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic."
24104,You'd better get out of that Stormcloak gear. Today's not the day to go around dressed like a rebel.
24106,"We may guard Whiterun, but the Thieves Guild guards us. If you know what I mean."
24108,It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock.
24109,Your spirit is strong. Kynareth's winds will guide your path.
24111,You aren't worth my time. Piss off.
24112,I have no time for Marla or Mara or whatever her name is... there's work to be done!
24113,"Ignoring me, huh? Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!"
24114,I set up the whole deal. A courier was supposed to be bringing it from Morrowind. He never arrived.
24118,Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.
24120,"The sap is precious. It can restore barren fields or bring life to rocks. I can use it to repair the Gildergreen, so we can worship properly again."
24121,"Soon, soon. These things must be done properly, you will be inducted as part of the Festival itself."
24123,I thank you. And may Kynareth's soft rains fall before you.
24125,"I may not live to see this little one grow into a new Gildergreen, but I can be remembered as the woman who planted it."
24126,"Please, we do not have much time."
24129,Be more careful next time. This isn't a game. 
24131,I... I don't have any money.
24132,"You should take it to Whiterun. Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance."
24133,Patience. Give me a moment and I'll explain everything.
24135,"Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion."
24137,"It was my pleasure, friend. In a way, I envy you getting to carry such a direct sign of Kynareth's graces."
24141,Good luck on your travels. May Kynareth's wind carry only the sweetest scents.
24143,You've got to help me! Please!
24144,"I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur."
24145,Do vah kiin!
24146,"But the deepest, keenest hatred was for himself."
24148,"I'm sorry, but I can't do it. We'll just have to keep fighting the dragons as best we can."
24149,But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?
24151,I've told you where Sky Haven Temple is. I'll trust you to get us there in one piece.
24152,"Ho, now... Keep me out of this..."
24153,Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you a great deal.
24154,"Sibbi will prove to be a fine leader one day, but Ingun... that girl has her mind somewhere other than business."
24158,Why? What did I do?
24162,You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops around without attracting a dragon attack.
24166,I think you overestimate Ulfric's chances. He's stretched himself too thin.
24170,Ulfric's insurrection has reached its high tide. Soon enough the rebel Jarls will realize what it means to oppose the Empire.
24171,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have nothing more to discuss. I encourage you to take your time and enjoy yourself. You look like you could use the rest."
24172,"Ha, enjoy the Chill."
24173,"Constance tries to stop her, and is real good to us, but it's never enough."
24174,"Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the right."
24177,True. A pause to consolidate our gains would be useful. And the Empire can afford to look magnanimous in victory.
24178,"I'll see about getting this order filled right away. Here, a few septims for you."
24179,Alduin mahlaan
24182,I like the pretty lights.
24184,But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize.
24185,"No, I certainly didn't!"
24188,"You're not planning on burning anything with that, are you?"
24192,"You wouldn't do that, would you? You wouldn't leave me here with her!"
24195,Your payment for services rendered.
24199,But... To have won against Malacath himself... That would be seen as real power.
24200,"Once again Brynjolf sends me someone with no backbone, no determination."
24201,Haven't heard from him since. 
24202,The only thing I understand is you bothering you.
24208,She thinks she's in love with Bassianus and wants to leave town. With him.
24210,"Alok, Vuljotnaak. Tiid boaan."
24213,"Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true, we're all doomed anyway."
24214,Even Tullius may be forced to talk sense in the face of such a threat.
24215,"Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true... well, it changes the situation doesn't it?"
24217,Got any work?
24221,It's difficult sometimes... To know whether what I see is real or not.
24222,"You speak truly, Dragonborn. Sometimes the grubby business of politics clouds my eyes."
24224,"I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?"
24229,I don't need you to teach me how to play high politics in Skyrim.
24231,"I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. Normally these parties are reserved for  the Jarls and business leaders of Skyrim."
24236,"If you find anyone you think would make a good recruit, I can certainly take a look at them."
24237,That was a close one!
24238,"Think I'm going to head out now. Take a long vacation from woodcutting, you know? Good luck."
24239,Lokir of Rorikstead.
24241,"He's stewing in the pit while we figure out what to do with him, if you've got the stomach to look at him."
24242,Oh my. How precious.
24244,They're miners. Harmless.
24248,I gave them no such pleasure.
24249,I think they wanted to break me. Use me as a way to get to the rest of the Gray-Mane family.
24252,We have no interest in negotiating with the Empire. It's only a matter of time before they are driven out of Skyrim.
24254,Now thanks to you I needn't worry anymore.
24255,"I wish I could believe that I'd have held out forever against their torture, but I can't be so sure."
24257,"Gods, I've lost count of the days. It feels like an age has passed."
24261,The fever... my body burns...
24264,So sick... can hardly stand it...
24269,I can't bear it... make it stop...
24270,Unghhh... oww...
24272,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
24273,The pain is so great...
24274,Try to relax. You'll be well soon enough.
24275,"All right, all right. I guess I made enough from his shipment. No need to waste any more time threatening a stable hand."
24276,More rest will do you good.
24277,"Pantea, perhaps you should attend to your students, and leave the politics to me."
24281,Legate.
24283,Feeling any better?
24284,What do you mean? That wine tastes finer than anythin' Surilie Brothers ever made.
24285,Ugh. The wine in Skyrim tastes like urine compared to the fine vintages we had in Valenwood.
24288,"All right, all right. Here."
24289,"Her name's Olda. If you've met her, then you probably already know what I'm talking about."
24290,Has your fever cooled?
24292,"It's not as bad as before, but I still can't get a good night's sleep."
24298,You'll pay for your blasphemy!
24299,"No, I guess not. Well, get out of here before I change my mind."
24300,Shhh.
24301,Thank you. The pain is already easing.
24302,"If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined."
24305,"Gods bless you, healer."
24306,It sounds like Eastmarch is too busy with their war to keep their own prisoners in line.
24307,"If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener?"
24309,The path to Paarthurnax lies through this gate. I will show you how to open the way.
24312,"Kynareth has blessed you with tremendous compassion, Silana. You will find a way, I'm sure of it."
24313,"Yes. I had Falk call you back because you were at the summoning, you have a connection to Potema now. You must deal with her."
24314,I don't think so.
24315,Ought put on some clothes. Bound to upset some people...
24318,"Good riddance.  Let's move on, the scroll must be in the next room."
24319,Don't reckon they can use you. But stranger things have happened.
24321,"If this is another dwarven trinket, I keep telling you I'm not familiar with them."
24326,"No, without Ranmir around we're running out of stock far less often than we used to."
24327,I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.
24328,"May you be saved by the Divines, as I once was."
24329,"Great! I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, then you can lead the way."
24331,My son died. Things won't be the same without him.
24334,"Hard enough to keep up with who owns this fort. One side takes over, the other runs away. I tell them, ""I ain't leaving! I come with the place!"" Ha!"
24335,"After that? Probably just stick around here. Saw some good game on my way here, and I'd like to stay close for a while."
24340,"Ah! Oh, by Kyne you startled me. There's a necromancer around here so watch yourself."
24341,There's no reasoning with these people anymore.
24343,More bad blood between the houses. Fralia is convinced our family is somehow at fault for the loss of her son.
24344,I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone watch my back.
24347,"That's interesting. Why do I care? You want a drink, or maybe just a few broken bones?"
24348,Just one more thing the Gray-Manes want to blame on others. 
24349,It's probably not a good idea to walk around naked like that.
24351,This is why I avoid being social.
24355,"It's enough for me to know that they're out there somewhere, and together again."
24356,"It's a great big festival put on by the bards, every year. They burn an effigy of old King Olaf. It's quite a bit of fun."
24359,I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now.
24360,Revenge? No. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to bend his knee and give me his soul.
24363,"He made the mistake of supporting the Stormcloaks, and it cost him. Bitter news for his family, but a fate they should've expected."
24364,Haven't you heard it by now?
24366,"Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure. Or... you could use..."
24368,I'll find that Elf. I always do.
24369,"As you say, it will happen."
24370,"If that's what you really believe, then you're a fool. Never had much patience for fools, myself."
24371,Here's the letter. Now leave me out of this.
24375,Then I'll wait.
24378,Have you seen that Shrine of Azura? They say the dark elves built it after they fled from Morrowind. Sight to see.
24381,Indeed it is.
24382,"That would be Skald the Elder. He's been running Dawnstar ever since he was a boy, and he never lost that brat's attitude."
24384,"Silence, idiot! I should have known better... to trust this place after it's been riddled with filth."
24385,Frost took my husband years ago. He was a good man.
24386,Don't let Viola catch you in her house.
24387,"Lately it seems I am more nurse than priestess, tending to those who have suffered, both in mind and body, from this terrible war."
24388,Don't let him get away with this!
24389, 
24390,"In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should talk to her about it before you go."
24391,What's that supposed to prove? Get back on patrol!
24392,"General Tullius, over here!"
24393,Deeja and I are more like their representatives here in Solitude. None of the Blackbloods can show themselves without being arrested.
24394,Remember Radiant Raiment when you need a change of attire.
24396,"Here you go, ma'am. The finest Colovian brandy."
24398,"Th...thank you, my Jarl thank you."
24399,There are always good reasons to fight. I just wish this war had them.
24400,"Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell Captain Aldis I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge."
24401,"Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing."
24404,"I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed."
24406,Splendid. Call if you have need of me.
24407,Get back!
24409,Then I have an important task for you.
24411,Good point.
24413,I do have one set of bracelets in a style that is popular with the nobility in Sentinel.
24417,"Be careful, lass. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you."
24419,"We had this same argument every week, even when you were Jarl."
24420,Looks like you're a little short on coin though. Sorry.
24421,"Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful."
24424,Good riddance to bad rubbish I say.
24425,I think I expected more.
24426,All meats guaranteed clean and free from Rockjoint!
24428,And he's right.
24430,You betrayed us!
24433,Where are you hiding?
24434,Strike us with the power of your Voice.
24435,Traitor!
24436,Stormcloak lover.
24437,"Remember, being a bard isn't just about the music."
24438,Get on with it.
24439,"Good, Illdi. Soak in the lore. Jorn, what happened during the Red Year?"
24440,The chests of gold didn't hurt.
24441,Late One-seventy-one.
24442,"This isn't as bad as it seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly! Please... he'll have me killed!"
24444,"Why do you intrude here, if not for tinvaak?"
24446,Even I cannot see past Time's ending to what comes next. Niid koraav zeim dinoksetiid. We must do the best we can with this world.
24450,Be sure to watch your finger positions. Especially during the transitions.
24452,Malacath has heard my pleas! He speaks to us!
24453,"All right, let's try something a bit more... fun."
24454,That's what I thought.
24455,What hole did you crawl out of?
24457,"Remember, it's your job to ""deliver"" these songs. To excite the crowd. Draw them in and they will love you for it."
24458,I've got a shipment of Spices the East Empire Company is holding up. I need someone to convince them to release it.
24464,Your chief Talos-hunter?
24465,Usual guild rate. Let's take a look at them.
24466,What? Get over with the rest of the men at Korvanjund.
24467,Ah yes. If she wants to pay the two thousand gold tariff than we'll be all set.
24469,Need something?
24471,I mean of course you will. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
24473,You will?
24476,"Just be patient, aunt. She'll have it, I promise."
24479,I've heard that miners sometimes die from poisonous gases trapped beneath the ground.
24480,"I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him."
24481,There's nothing quite like a good vegetable.
24482,"Any fool can just flail about, swinging his weapon as fast as he can. Any fool can die. Keep your guard up and wait for an opening."
24483,No. I was just getting some fresh air. Had one too many pints of mead at the Silver-Blood Inn.
24485,The Forsworn have taken Kolskeggr Mine. We're the only ones left.
24488,I suppose I could make an exception. I do like her spiced wine.
24494,"Keep walking, stranger."
24496,Thank you so much. I swear it's a fight with them every shipment. Here's something for your troubles.
24497,"Just like anywhere else, it's all about who you know. Lucky for you, you know me."
24498,"The nature of the favors varies per deity. Please, feel free to worship at any or all of the shrines."
24503,"Hmm? Ah, yes. That once held the shrine to Talos. But the worship of Talos was banned by the White-Gold Concordat, some time ago."
24506,No matter how much the Stormcloaks may wish it were so.
24509,Then I don't have time for you.
24511,"In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power."
24513,Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.
24514,The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?
24518,"I don't care that we lost, I'm just glad the war is over."
24520,Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.
24521,"Me? I'm Maul. I watch the streets for 'em. If you need dirt on anythin', I'm your guy... but it'll cost you."
24522,"Alduin, thuri!"
24524,"I once captained a ship called the Argent Raptor. She struck an iceberg and went down, just north of Windhelm."
24525,"Go ahead, Ataf."
24526,The cornerclub's been filling up at night lately. I'll bet Elda up at Candlehearth is jealous.
24527,"Yes. My older brother. He was a bit of a fop, really."
24528,Work hard for the future and leave the past be. That's my motto.
24529,"Well, you were right. These so called 'Gutter Saints' live in the sewers beneath."
24530,"Fly, my hunter. There are others who vie for my favor. A bit of competition. Don't dally while the prey flees. "
24531,"Here's your reward, as promised. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work."
24536,But you're not out of the woods yet! Get it? Out of the woods? 
24537,"Yes, of course. The Arch-Mage has my thanks."
24538,Very good. Then we're done here.
24540,Your superior and I were simply having a... discussion about my level of access to the College.
24541,Aiiiieee!
24543,Sorries don't help anyone.
24545,"That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through."
24546,"You think so, huh? Maybe you'd like to put some septims behind that boast."
24547,"Aerin, I owe you my life. It would take a threat to all of Skyrim for me to depart."
24552,Maybe you'd like to try the horker? Or some beef?
24554,The Arch-Mage believed it important. It must be powerful.
24555,"We don't know that. We don't even know what it is. Where is Aren, anyway?"
24556,"Oh ho. Now that's the Dark Brotherhood I know and love. This for business or pleasure? Ah, what's it matter, right? I'll see that it gets done."
24558,"Stay out of trouble, Imperial."
24559,I inherited the store from my husband. His father was Arnleif.
24560,"Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!"
24563,Such was my... honor. As Keeper.
24565,Taxes. I love taxes.
24568,The poor dear must truly be hungry to comb through rubbish like that. Hope he finds something edible.
24569,"The Night Mother's crypt in Bravil was... desecrated. The Imperial Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present."
24570,"So while I was in Ivarstead, I heard news that something terrible happened at Helgen."
24571,"You know, I'll pay you to attack one of my enemies..."
24572,You did? Really?
24573,"There are cities so ancient, the sands have swallowed them whole. But now I will say no more, for I miss my home greatly."
24575,Dishonorable dog. You attacked one of my kin. So now you're going to apologize... or I'm going to lop off your head.
24581,What? Who is the Night Mother?
24582,Why are you still here?
24583,I've seen him sneaking over to the Riverwood Trader to speak with her when I'm not around. He's wasting his time.
24585,"It's Nilsine Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm. If Nilsine dies, too... I'll make it worth your while."
24586,Too easy.
24587,I'll fight you to the end!
24588,Stop it! I don't like magic.
24589,"Oohhh... Cicero's heard about the Butcher. Interesting knifework. Just... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab! And then... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!"
24591,I think someone has a crush on Illdi.
24592,He is... the Void.
24595,Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.
24596,The daughters of this land are just as strong and loyal as its men.
24597,"I'll sell just about anything, if it's worth my time. Keep that in mind, will you?"
24598,Have you taken leave of your senses?
24601,Everybody pushes me around. Well no more!
24609,"Oh, yes! The prophecies make clear the signs that will precede the end times. One by one, I have seen them fulfilled."
24610,Your objective is Fort Greenwall.
24611,No. I was just buying jewelry for my sister in Cyrodiil. I've never even seen that man before.
24616,"Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?"
24617,"That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle."
24622,"The Empire didn't think we could take the Reach, but here we are."
24625,"Not much. One moment I was buying a necklace, and the rest is just a blur."
24627,"And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire."
24629,No. I'm not.
24630,"If it were to somehow end up in my hands, I wouldn't argue. "
24631,Was is that obvious? Damn. I must be losing my touch.
24632,"You're a talker, eh?"
24635,"Even a fine weapon is only as good as its wielder, sir. But they should fetch a high price from the Imperial army."
24637,Any day now more draugr are going to come out of that crypt.
24638,"Look, it was one night, okay? I think she slipped something in my drink. I haven't even been back to the Bunkhouse since."
24641,"You know, I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago."
24642,"Why do they need me to do this?  We use magic, not weapons."
24643,"Morthal is a troubled place, and it is my duty to see it rest in peace."
24644,Mark my words. Thonar Silver-Blood was behind that attack in the market. Somehow.
24646,"Everyone else, with me."
24647,"They own Cidhna Mine, one of the toughest jails in Skyrim. I was hoping I could buy or steal the deed, but I don't think that's how things work here."
24648,Pity.
24649,Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard? There must be eight of them in there.
24650,"The worship of Talos outlawed, and now the Thalmor come to conduct their witch-hunts while the Empire stands idly by."
24652,The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.
24653,Rather not talk. I have to head back to Cyrodiil soon.
24654, 
24658,Here's the gold I promised. Keep following the trail and there will be more in it for you.
24662,"You've been warned, outsider."
24664,I don't buy all that talk about ship captains having to be stern and strict. I want my crewmen to enjoy their work.
24665,Back off. You don't want to know what happens to troublemakers here.
24666,"Excuse me. I'm assuming that armor you got rid of wasn't an accident, but just in case, I wanted to make sure I could take it."
24667,"Now, what's he's asking, it's just impossible. Even if it worked, the questions and accusations it would cause..."
24668,"They named me Thane, and they got my nephew Siddgeir in my place. A real friend to Cyrodiil, that one."
24670,Run for it!
24671,"I understand Eirid's been playing ""Hunt the Elf"" again."
24673,One of my customers? Did you know I inherited the store from my late husband? Shame what happened to him. He had such good taste.
24674,As you wish.
24676,"Sir, the Imperial Legion has again requested assistance. What shall I tell them?"
24686,You've been warned.
24687,A debt. Is a debt.
24688,"From the look of you, I'm guessing you're more looking to cause some trouble for the Horkers."
24689,"Oh, I do not approve at all."
24690,"Well then, look. Look all you want. And when you're done looking, maybe we can get some work done."
24693,The Dark Elves live in a run-down slum called the Gray Quarter. Ulfric's content to keep it that way. 
24694,Dragonborn?
24699,No. I don't.
24702,No.
24704,"If you journey north, keep well away from Snapleg Cave. Damned Hagravens have infested the place."
24707,Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
24708,"For that amount, I can. Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay."
24710,Haven't up until now.
24711,"I'm really getting tired of your excuses. When you borrowed the money, you said you'd pay it back on time and for double the usual fee."
24712,"Come to see the hag with an offering of coin, then? So be it. I accept your investment."
24713,I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will. 
24715,Wise women like myself are mothers of chieftains. We guide the tribe and advice our kin on what is most pleasing to Malacath.
24718,"True sons and daughters of Skyrim reign in every city, we've crippled the Imperial Legion, and cut off its head by killing General Tullius himself."
24721,I'm so glad you got back from Olaf's Tomb okay. They gave you a tougher task then they gave me.
24722,Hmph.
24723,"Well, that's the good and the bad of it. "
24724,"Come on, come on. The sooner you buy, the sooner I can get drunk."
24725,Looks to be another cold day.
24728,"One more time, and the World-Eater must face us!"
24729,"We've lost a lot of good people to that damn crusade. Drive out the Nords, they say. Well, the Nord ain't driven out."
24731,Don't get involved in that nonsense. Just want to work.
24735,The heat of battle is the fire that forges the strongest blades. It's an old Nord proverb.
24736,You don't like the Nords? Fine. But pledging your whole life to killing them? That's just dumb.
24740,Mulush. Big Orc fella. Can't miss him.
24742,"Me and Hathrasil mostly. Mulush barks at us all day, but I wouldn't call that honest work."
24743,The Vigil will be watching you.
24744,What? No. Thonar Silver-Blood owns it. He owns everything in Markarth.
24745,She... spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie! The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener!  
24746,Go on. See what she says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.
24747,"A good lumberjack is quiet, hard-working, and honest."
24752,Free mead!
24754,Let me take a look at what you found.
24755,"Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us to give up Markarth at the negotiating table."
24756,A citizen of Whiterun has asked for our help.
24757,Tell me again why we're wasting time and dwindling resources chasing a legend. We don't even know it exists!
24762,This is how you repay our trust? Paarthurnax's trust?
24763,Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was Gallus's pet project.
24765,Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had to learn to use their power.
24766,Come on. I don't want to hit you until you have your ward ready.
24769,Laborers. The sick. The lame. We're all here.
24771,"It's where you go if you can't afford a room anywhere else. About the time they opened the mines, someone got the idea to throw beds in here."
24775,"In time, he brought me here. To the box. "
24778,Oh yes. I know everyone who sleeps in the Warrens. Kind of the one who passes the keys around.
24782,"Sorry, but you don't exactly belong here."
24783,"He he he he he he he. The real question is, ""Would someone pay to have me killed... again."""
24785,Come... embrace your death!
24787,"Trust is hard to come by here, but all right."
24789,Yes sir.
24790,"No, I don't think so."
24791,Welcome to the Warrens.
24795,And I wasn't stuttering. No key.
24796,Right.
24797,"I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine."
24798,"Here you go, boss. All the details."
24800,Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.
24801,You've been digging around where you don't belong.
24804,"No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent symbol for his cause to rally around. "
24808,I don't care if you're best buddies with the Guild Master. I'll still smash in your skull if you try anything.
24810,"Ironically, if she were alive today, she'd be the only living member of the Septim bloodline. By all rights, she would now be Empress."
24813,Go on in.
24814,"Hello again, friend. I'll never forget what you did for me."
24816,Excuse me. What's your business here?
24821,Remember to stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows. I have some if you don't have any.
24823,"If you must know, I'm the maid. And the master of the house is old and needs his rest."
24827,"Raerek, how is The Reach faring against this Forsworn menace?"
24829,"Father, could you clean up the house a little while I'm away?"
24833,"It's an honor, Keeper of the Ring."
24834,Aye!
24835,You forsake the weak and pitiful Boethiah?
24837,"Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send her in."
24838,"Hmph. Yes, Nepos."
24839,You've made a mess of things and Maven's furious. I told you not to burn more than three of the hives!
24842,"That's right. It isn't yours. You're under arrest, Brand-Shei."
24844,"You disrespected the Brotherhood. And it'll cost you. You want back into the Family, you pay the price. 500 gold, and all is forgiven."
24846,This how you get your thrills? Feeling up an old man?
24850,Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he did.
24851,"This is a fine wedding. And to think, it's for us."
24852,"Because my king told me to. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines."
24853,Good. Wait until I start the distraction and then show me what you're made of.
24854,"I don't know how, but he lives. I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question."
24855,"My king. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines."
24856,We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.
24857,"Come down here and fight, you coward!"
24858,The Greybeards...
24859,"I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question."
24860,"Look, we've got to deal with this situation. You've got to deal with this situation."
24861,"When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines. I don't know how, but he lives."
24862,"But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises. "
24863,I... I don't care! I'm not paying!
24865,"That's all right. I can teach you a very basic ward, one that's enough for the purposes of this lesson."
24866,That looks dangerous...
24867,"If you need any alchemy supplies, I'll do my best to provide them. Assuming I haven't used them all up."
24869,"My dear girl, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?"
24870,"This is an orphanage, not an inn. Begone from here."
24872,One moment.
24873,This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.
24879,It was my idea to replace one of the key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went into it.
24880,I've been holding onto this for you. Here! I hope you like it.
24881,All from inside Cidhna Mine. A Nord prison. The irony is quite thick.
24882,You'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine right away. And welcome to the College of Winterhold.
24883,"Lord of Seasons, I pray to you now that you might watch over the dead with mercy and kindness."
24884,My brother Jon's got the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war.
24885,"Shall we proceed, friend?"
24887,"Don't start swinging that thing in here. You break it, you buy it."
24888,"Then one day, I was drunker than I've ever been and mounted a poor colt. Broke his back in two. Haven't ridden since."
24889,It's bad enough my brother is harping on me to pick one. Don't you start too.
24891,He is the King in Rags. A man who once held all the Reach within his grip.
24893,"Then Ulfric and his men came. Those of us who didn't run were executed, except for myself, my king, and a handful of others."
24896,"But then during their war with the elves, we had our moment. We drove the Nords out of the Reach in a great uprising."
24897,"Honor may mean nothing to you, but it means much to me. Your apology, or your life."
24898,Markarth and the Reach are our lands. That is why we are the Forsworn. We cannot claim the home that is rightly ours.
24899,"You are troubled, Gorm."
24900,"Good work. Here's your gold. I have a feeling Nepos gets his own orders, though. If you find out, I'll have more for you."
24901,"No, I guess not. Well, the principle applies here. It's a potion, made from those dragon parts. Give it a try."
24907,And everything is made of stone. Even the beds. We'll have no trouble from dragon's fire here.
24908,"And of course, they own Cidhna Mine, the finest prison and source of silver in Skyrim."
24909,Hroggar's house? It burned down not too long ago.
24910,"I'm glad Ralof is helping drive them out of here. If I was a bit younger, I might have joined the fight myself."
24911,"I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you."
24912,"Here you are. Now remember, people in Skyrim respond to deeds. You will find more people interested in your love if you help them."
24913,"If you're here to talk politics, though, you'd want his brother Thongvor. He spends most of his time in Understone Keep."
24916,"I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes."
24917,Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
24920,"The temple, Betrid? You were one of Dibella's faithful?"
24921,"For one, the landowners of the Reach. It goes without saying that they rely heavily on us for our silver and support."
24924,"To me, it means not having to answer foolish questions a second time."
24927,The Thalmor's memory is long.
24928,"So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture."
24929,It was a cold day. The end of Frostfall is nearly winter in the Jerall Mountains.
24930,"Private business, I mean. No visitors."
24931,Riches are a gate-opener around here. Head right in.
24932,I'm just a soldier. Killing is my job! Surely you can't fault a man for doing his job?
24934,"Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice."
24935,"Oh, it's you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant."
24937,That must be the Voice!
24938,Careful!
24939,"You're right, it's none of your business. How about you keep your nose out of it?"
24940,I must have misheard you. Did you say you were leaving?
24941,A dragon?
24943,"Look, friend, if you think you can do better than the legion of guards, be my guest. "
24945,"...hmph, wizards... Now that's power... Bet they got that ""secret"" magic... can turn wood to gold... yeah... Wish I could turn wood to gold..."
24947,"I doubt he'll be free, but all right."
24948,Let me know when you've learned more about the pirates.
24949,"I have poisons for your weapons, and cures for your ills."
24950,"So it's true, then. For now, it's enough to know that he's alive. I can find peace in that."
24953,What are you doing here? I told them no visitors.
24954,Now get out.
24957, 
24958,What a display of color!
24961,"""For Clan Battle-Born!"" they cry in the mead halls. ""First into the fray and last to quit their ale!"""
24964,She finally decided to return it to her father. Bless her heart.
24965,They're crazy. Think they rule the Reach.
24966,Hmph. Tell me something I don't know. Crazy fool's already asked me about five times. Seems he's not satisfied with my answer.
24968,Markarth is my city. You have no right looking into my business. Now get out.
24969,The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor. You'll have to prove yourselves to them.
24971,"You are no match for me, Dovahkiin."
24973,I trust you found your journey to Winterhold not entirely unpleasant.
24975,Damn Madanach. Damn his Forsworn backside.
24976,My wife. They killed her.
24977,"And that's why I won't rest easy until every single Imperial soldier joins her, and Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim."
24978,"Take it slow and careful, and I think we can sneak by her."
24979,Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm upset?
24980,"See, that kind of attitude comes from someone who wants to get rich and stay alive long enough to enjoy it. We're goin' to get along nicely."
24981,The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
24982,Who needs customers and their old junk?
24983,Shut up. Only the gods can judge me. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
24984,"The Emperor's cousin, killed. Right here in Solitude. I feel nothing but shame..."
24986,Now keep going.
24988,What's happened? He's not...
24990,He was supposed to keep them under control.
24992,"They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the Imperials behind them!"
24993,"I offered him a stay from execution if he used his influence to deal with any annoyances that came up. Competitors, agents, idiots."
24996,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything all right?"
24997,We already have people that do that and they make quite a bit of coin for it.
24999,"And... I heard about Nilsine. You have more than fulfilled your part of the bargain. Please, take this - as payment, and a symbol of my affection."
25001,"You survived! You have it, then?"
25002,"When their uprising was crushed, I had Madanach brought to me. He was a wild animal, but a useful one."
25003,But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of flesh.
25007,"I have to remember... ward first, then summon."
25009,"For now, give this ""Ratway"" a wide berth."
25010,"Well, he's been very busy. Perhaps today he'll have some free time."
25011,Then you know the hard looks as judgment gets set upon you. The sneers of people who never had to face sentence.
25012,"But again, we see that the natural order will be restored, one way or another."
25013,"Madesi, why don't you just take a bed here? There's no need to sleep in Beggar's Row."
25017,Get of my house. Now.
25022,Teeba-Ei the hatchling never imagined working a mine in this cold place. Greater things were dreamt of.
25023,"I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith. Afterwards, her magic sustained me."
25024,My prison. The source of half the silver in Skyrim. The most secure prison in Tamriel.
25027,"This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my help, not to use me as a test subject!"
25028,Have the decency to leave me to my sorrows.
25031,"They call me a war hero. I'm no hero, I'm just a soldier who didn't want to die."
25035,"Legend has it that the crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and is said to increase the power of the wearer."
25038,"I've taken over the Hag's Cure, since Bothela is gone."
25039,I know Galmar. We fought in many wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes the crown is there... he's likely found it.
25040,"It's a religious matter. The Thalmor do not recognize Talos as a god. He was only a man, and does not deserve to a place in our pantheon."
25042,"If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole."
25044,"Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas, when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns."
25045,"Blacksmith, at your service."
25047,I wasn't expecting to see you here! I assume you have your reasons. Everyone does.
25049,"We're backing Elisif. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing."
25052,"This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only."
25054,"We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support."
25056,Ugh! Only a fool tries to kill the dead!
25060,Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?
25065,By Ysmir! That's impressive.
25066,Ungrien! I just found another spoiled keg! What's the matter with you?
25067,I guess... I'll hold down the fort by my lonesome. Hurry back and tell them to send a garrison. Quickly!
25068,"Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. Dragon Bridge is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense."
25069,"Thank you, soldier. Let's take a look at these reports..."
25070,I can't believe we're the only ones who survived.
25071,What's the hurry?
25072,"Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is."
25073,Guess Tullius wants to make sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for Eastmarch.
25074,Many thanks!
25075,"Hello and welcome, my friend. How may I help you on this fine day?"
25077,"If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric."
25078,"It means I have a business to run, I need to have the books straight and you're barely ever here!"
25079,"Please, you can't leave me in here! If you let me out I can show you where they hide their best treasure."
25083,It's about time Brynjolf sent me someone with business sense. I was beginning to think he was running some sort of beggar's guild over there.
25084,"The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout."
25085,"Well, yes. But the Key isn't only restricted to physical barriers."
25086,This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. 
25087,"If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck."
25089,Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the Guild although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.
25090,"Good enough. I'll just confiscate any stolen goods you're carrying, then you're free to go."
25092,Oh no! They've found me? I need your help!
25093,That would be wonderful.
25094,Fight! Fight!
25097,"I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong."
25098,I'm afraid I didn't see anything...
25100,"Hello, dear. I haven't been drinking too much, if that's what you're thinking."
25103,"Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid."
25104,Another corpse for the pile.
25108,You are free to leave.
25109,"Tell me again, why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale."
25110,"You're worth putting in the extra effort for, pooch."
25111,"A little snow never stopped me, don't worry."
25113,Well... you did show remarkable initiative. And you didn't have to bring the crown to me...
25114,"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
25116,No! Wait! We're not rebels!
25117,What if the Forsworn come here? We aren't safe.
25119,Someone who doesn't like you asking questions.
25121,"Last I saw him, he was visiting a friend in the Blue Palace. But no one as mundane as the Jarl. No, no... such people are below him."
25122,"Quickly now, or would you prefer I let Whiterun fall to the Stormcloaks?"
25126,"If the workers had a dispute, we'd rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments."
25127,You have to train a good war dog from a pup. Bite your arm clean off otherwise.
25128,The fairest prices and the highest quality in Skyrim!
25131,I got nothing to say to you.
25132,"Good to see you again, friend."
25133,"Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine. "
25134,It's rotten because the wood is cheap and its soaked with ale! Now we'll have to replace all the furniture before bugs set in.
25137,It's probably best if you put that weapon away.
25138,We want compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
25139,Speak with General Tullius. He'll administer the oath.
25140,"Come along, no more stops, we need to find our way to Solitude."
25142,"Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed."
25143,"I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. Leave me alone."
25144,"It's called a shortsword, oaf. It's quicker. Sharper. Like a razorfish against a whale."
25145,"By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh?"
25146,"Mistress, a word?"
25149,The mill!
25153,"Right, but if you plow the soil with fire salts..."
25154,"I keep hoping this is another vision, that it's not real. But it is, isn't it? We really have lost our home."
25155,"Now that the Imperial blight has poisoned Riften, the worship of Talos is strictly forbidden by the terms of the White-Gold Concordat."
25157,"You behave like you're carousing in a house of ill repute, not the residence of the Thalmor Ambassador!"
25158,And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to regret this day.
25161,Now we never talk about it again. Got it?
25164,What is it now? We have a tasting to attend to!
25165,"I don't want to hear another word about what you're learning from the elf! It's high time you learned to be a Nord, too!"
25166,Grow back that missing limb!
25167,"I mean, someone who's not me, that is. "
25168,I'll do it.
25169,We're going to make them pay.
25171,Not really.
25172,"They look like they were made with... well, the ancient Nords used these kinds of curved blades when they embalmed their dead."
25173,The only unusual thing is the shape of the cuts.
25174,"And I wouldn't very well tell you about the cuts if I had made them, now would I?"
25176,"Now, I really got to get back to the body. Lot of work to prepare her for the grave."
25177,Here's what I can spare.
25178,I will see that it is dealt with. Thank you for bringing clarity.
25180,I take what little business I can git. I'm grateful for anyone willin' to spend money here.
25185,"I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body, and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!"
25188,"Oh my, yes. I absolutely love weddings. I haven't found my special someone yet, but there's still hope. Vittoria is, well, getting up in years..."
25189,Here's your share. Nicely done.
25191,But I never knew if nights-end brought victory - a swift-flying arrow to Sovngarde carried me.
25193,I hope you can change my father's mind. He can be a little stubborn.
25196,Feel free to sit and put your head down on the table for as long as you like. I won't bother you.
25198,"Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet, loud, quick, slow - whatever you feel is best."
25199,I'll introduce you to Farengar. He can be a bit... difficult. Mages. You know.
25200,"Hold, there!"
25201,Bring back this tablet that Farengar wants and I'll be in your debt.
25203,"Go, incinerate some poor bastard for me."
25206,"Here, take this as a small token of my esteem."
25208,"I just handed you the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Does that make me Dragonborn, too?"
25210,"I'm sure Riverwood will be all right, dear. When the Jarl learns what's happened, he's sure to send soldiers."
25211,"I see you still have the run of the place, traitor."
25212,Have no fear. I believe it is within you to excel in your studies. But you must learn to concentrate!
25213,I can't afford to send anyone else. And we don't know where the dragon is. 
25215,"Yes, Housecarl. We'll leave immediately."
25216,Your main job will be to keep an eye out and get the people to safety if the town is attacked.
25217,"It's just us against a dragon, is that it?"
25218,So don't concern yourself with it. Markarth is safe. You have my word.
25220,I don't expect the three of you to fight off a dragon by yourselves. But I do expect you to do your duty.
25221,Of course. We'll keep Riverwood safe. You can count on it.
25222,Let's move out. Time's a wasting.
25224,Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes.
25225,"I haven't known you to drink before, Ataf."
25228,"Please, sir, leave me alone!"
25231,I've eaten more in the last two hours than I have in the last two weeks.
25232,"That would work, except you ain't got."
25233,Yeah? Why?
25234,I'm not looking for a conversation.
25235,"I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong."
25236,Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.
25237,"Call it whatever you like, General. The man's going to try to take Whiterun. "
25238,Jarl Balgruuf...
25239,Not at this rate. I'll just go back to clubbing horkers and scaring the debtors.
25241,"On the other hand, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim."
25242,What's going on?
25245,"Well if it turns up, I'll be willing to buy."
25246,You people and your damn Jarls.
25247,You can't force a Nord to accept help he hasn't asked for.
25248,Sir?
25249,I can't lose all my research. There has to be a way to save the College.
25250,"If you can learn to keep your composure and trust that each shot is true, then you should be able to quickly handle multiple targets.  "
25252,"I thought we were taking Ulfric back to Cyrodiil, but I guess the General changed his mind. You know the rest."
25254,You gonna hurt me again?
25256,Tell Shadr he doesn't owe me anything.
25257,"If Vokun is as powerful as I think, I may need a little help um ... dealing ...with him."
25259,"""I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak..."""
25263,I tell you this province is losing its grip. The bandits become more brazen every day.
25264,I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
25265,"What my daughter sees in that... barbarian, I'll never know."
25266,I've got coin and I've got merchandise. Let's see what we can do.
25267,"Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now."
25269,"One of the prisoners, if I recall correctly. "
25270,"If anyone should be thanked, it should be you."
25272,Suddenly I feel much better.
25273,"That... I gave it to her on our wedding day. Help me, Divines... it's true isn't it? "
25276,"I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber for the last quarter century."
25279,"In the meantime, why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke. "
25282,"But he hasn't reported in yet, so he can't exactly confirm your story. "
25283,"I am an artisan, painting in strokes of blood red upon the canvas of life. But yes, I will take coin to fight at your side."
25284,Hadvar's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good soldier. 
25286,"It is my personal mission to ensure that the Bards College preserves the great deeds of the past, in both poetry and song."
25289,"Nothing to say. Fine, but I'm watching you."
25290,Ooh. That had to hurt.
25292,"If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject."
25293,That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.
25295,Not today. Sold my last one. Pretty sure I sold it to you.
25296,"To protect my research, for one. There are more cutthroat scholars out there who would steal my findings if they got the chance."
25297,"Madesi, my friend. How have things been since last week's incident?"
25298,"I'm not going to go through the normal process with you. I've got a little test lined up. Pass that, and we'll talk about you joining the Legion."
25299,"But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade."
25300,You survived Helgen? General Tullius told me what happened. Not many made it out alive...
25301,"On his deathbed, my master urged me to take over his business but I decided against it. I chose to wander Tamriel instead."
25302,Are you lost? 
25303,We'll soon find out.
25306,"We have a nice arrangement in this city, and we're not letting you get in the way."
25308,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
25312,Use your Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.
25313,"There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich, you should try it sometime."
25314,"Yes it can. I haven't been wrong in 50 years, and I won't be wrong tomorrow."
25315,With pleasure.
25317,"Sadly, most have fallen into disrepair. And nearly all have been overrun with bandits or other vagabonds. "
25320,"Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now."
25322,And it's full of vampires?
25323,"Thorald... Thorald Gray-Mane? Fighting for the Stormcloaks, disappeared and believed dead?"
25324,Yes. This is a test. I don't think you're regular militia material. I want to see what you're capable of.
25326,"Oh, I'm not sure I could ever settle down like you have, friend. "
25331,The Jarl of Falkreath will view that as a provocation! He'll assume we're preparing to join Ulfric's side and attack him.
25333,I think I almost got it.
25336,"There are indeed. Three, to be exact."
25339,"I swear, every wanderer who shows up in Whiterun looks weaker than the last."
25342,"Thank you. I don't know what's going on, but I think I owe you my life."
25343,Careful with that fire.
25344,"For goodness sake, Bolli! You barely lift a finger yourself when you're here except to point at things for your workers to do."
25345,"My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once."
25346,Are you ready to enter the Star and purge the soul of Malyn Varen?
25347,I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my own sword.
25348,"Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies."
25350,Hmm? What? Project? You think you could help me? I really don't think so.
25351,I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...
25352,"Ah, indeed? The Jarl... Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons."
25353,Excellent. I can't wait.
25354,We've got them pinned in! It's only a matter of time now. Keep fighting!
25355,"Oh, thank you so much! It's wonderful to have someone around who understands."
25358,I'm not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.
25360,I'm so nervous.
25363,"It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look."
25364,There is much beauty in this place.
25366,"Hmph. Well, that's sure to throw a branch into Falkreath's well-oiled political machine."
25367,"Do your loyalties lie with the Thalmor, then?"
25368,"The Jarl can be found in the Great Hall, probably sitting on his Jarl's throne. Not over here in a wizard's laboratory."
25371,"This has all been foreseen, and we must play our parts."
25373, 
25375,"Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through.  But you... you're going places."
25376,"Why would I do that? For money? Because I swore an oath? No, it was because he was a good man and a true friend."
25377,Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack.
25378,"Indeed I have, sir. Elven weapons for their armies, sir. Elven material, but poor workmanship, like most of what we get from them."
25379,But I began to search for information about dragons - where had they gone all those years ago? And where were they coming from?
25380,One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside his experience as being impossible.
25381,"You see, when the stories of dragons began to circulate, many dismissed them as mere fantasies, rumors. Impossiblilities."
25385,Dodge this!
25386,"Assorted fruits and vegetables, all delicious and affordable!"
25387,Give up?
25389,"Oh, it's no trouble. She's a smart little girl. Might talk your ear off, but she's fun. "
25392,"You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun, the sooner done, eh?"
25395,Meet me then if you've still got the stomach for it.
25396,Go away. Go away. Go away!
25402,"Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there. It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of here."
25403,"An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the Dragon War itself."
25404,You play so well.
25405,Orgnar. I'm travelling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.
25406,"Being honorable might make you a good man, but it doesn't make you right. Be a better world if it did."
25407,Come see me in the marketplace tomorrow. You won't find better prices in all of Eastmarch.
25410,These poor souls... suffering in eternal servitude.
25412,Good. Let's hope it's a lesson learned.
25413,Come on! I dare you!
25414,"Thank you for helping my Aunt, earlier. I'll see you around."
25415,You have returned with the gauntlets! Enter. Speak to our chief right away.
25419,It's almost all I have time for these days.
25420,"Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim."
25421,"But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us."
25425,"Why, this very palace was built by one of Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name - Dragonsreach."
25427,"Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us."
25428,I'm gonna kill you!
25430,Tread lightly.
25431,"Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into historical times."
25432,"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
25433,Protect the Jarl!
25435,That he worries about being chased from Whiterun.
25436,"Farengar, I see you've already met my new friend here."
25437,"If he keeps it, I will bide my time. If he returns it to you, it means war."
25438,"Yes, my lady. I will pass the good news on to her."
25442,Balgruuf!
25443,There's no need to be concerned. We've been through more difficult times than this.
25444,I don't like where this is going.
25445,Go ahead and fill her in with all the details.
25446,"We have felt the whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found."
25447,"Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders."
25448,"This is a priority now. Anything we can use to fight this dragon, or dragons. We need it, quickly. Before it's too late."
25449,"Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my Shield-Sisters through time."
25453,It 'may be' in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much question.
25454,"Hmm... Yes, the silence suits you. Gives you an air of mystery. "
25457,Don't let my uncle go on about his theories. You'll be here all night.
25458,"Succeed at this, and you'll be rewarded. Whiterun will be in your debt."
25459,"And perhaps some day, you'll join us in that battle. But for today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory."
25460,I'll not stand idly by while a dragon burns my hold and slaughters my people!
25461,Thank you. Blessings of Mara upon you as well.
25463,"Not yet, not yet. When we get to Riverwood... with Delphine... I'll tell you both then, when I've collected my thoughts."
25464,But it seems you have no intention of dealing fairly with me.
25466,"So, it is done. Alduin dilon. The Eldest is no more, he who came before all others, and has always been."
25469,"Good, then you understand why this is about more than just Mercer's lust for power."
25475,Stop it! This is a one-on-one duel!
25476,Stop that.
25477,And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?
25479,"Oh, hello. Have a seat, will you?"
25480,A coin or two for a veteran? It's not much to ask...
25481,"When I get home, I'll have him start on it right away. Come back to pick it up in, oh... three days?"
25482,"She's also got ties to the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, so basically no one can touch her."
25483,"Do not be so sure about that. Beware - the Blades may claim to serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have."
25484,"He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire."
25488,"Used to have run-ins with the guards, now they have run-ins with me."
25489,"Is that a threat? Back off, or by the Eight I'll cleave that arrogant head from its shoulders."
25492,It is no great secret that we have been unjustly blamed for a great many things over the years.
25493,"Oh, yes? We'll get to that, after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation."
25494,"You'd better speak to the Jarl, then."
25495,"Well, I'm not quite done myself. "
25499,"By Ysmir, Irileth was right!"
25500,You once told me you did not believe in destiny.
25504,Riften is off the table. The Empire barely has a toehold left in Skyrim. We don't need to pay such a high price for this truce.
25505,"Hail, Dragonborn. That honor is also mine - to our shared birthright you'll bring new glory!"
25506,Well. You surprise me. I was expecting you to favor Ulfric. Maybe this council will achieve something after all.
25507,"Not sure you belong here, citizen."
25508,"Look, this is really simple. I lent him some gold, he promised to pay me back and now he says he's broke. End of story."
25509,What's the current spirit among the dark elves?
25510,I knew that stupid kid would try and find a way to weasel out of his debt.
25513,"This place has seen better days, but it's not my fault."
25517,"Unmid and Anuriel shouldn't blame themselves for Riften's fall, I am the one who's ultimately responsible."
25521,You have vanquished a great evil from Skyrim. You have saved this land... and our very souls.
25522,"I don't care, a deal's a deal."
25523,Patience. The body needs time to mend.
25524,Yeah. Threw it in the lake like you said.
25526,Safe travels.
25529,"You don't have enough gold to pay it off, and I'm not cutting any deals."
25531,You can tell Shadr his debt's been paid.
25535,I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.
25536,"How are your parents faring, Grelka? Doing better than we are I would guess."
25537,Listener!
25538,Ha ha! Are you kidding me? I've got the entire Thieves Guild at my back. What've you got?
25539,"Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me."
25540,"All right, all right! Take it easy. No idea why you'd care about a stranger so much, but this isn't worth a fight."
25543,I've been at Arnleif and Sons all my life. It's a good store.
25544,"Well, I had forgotten we had our horses tied up just outside of Windhelm... Vex rode hers back and arrived hours before I did."
25545,"You can go back and forth all you want, he just needs to pay."
25548,"Better to work in the cold than in the heat, I say. Though some sun would be nice."
25549,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
25550,"Back off, this action's all mine. No room for anyone else in the Guild on this one."
25551,No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.
25553,"If we had known the Nords would be so unwelcoming, we may have kept walking."
25555,Hert keeps giving me this look. I don't know if she wants me or if she wants to eat me.
25557,Tell you what. I'll give you a share right now if you forget the whole thing.
25558,Bashnag cursed me. I can't cast a spell to save my life right now. I'll have to wait until the way out is safe.
25560,I wonder what great battles were fought here?
25561,The Jarl is... tired. Be mindful of that.
25565,Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire!
25566,"You consider Restoration a valid school of magic, worthy of study, don't you? Don't you?"
25569,Although our Jarl's humble wizard might be willing to help you too.
25570,"Fancies himself a bard. He pays, so I let him stay."
25572, 
25578,My father was all the family I ever had. I felt so lost when he died. But the crew of the Red Wave's my family now.
25579,"Yeah, I figured it would be like that. Here you go."
25583,"I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself."
25585,Don't see many travelers out this way.
25586,We raided a caravan one spring... I think it was a few wagons with some farmers moving to a new village.
25591,"Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough."
25592,"I haven't seen Savos since the explosion. He must've been blown clear, and he may be injured."
25595,"Try not to play favorites, Lady Ateia. It does a disservice to the whole class."
25596,I just want to go home and read.
25597,Huh? What do you want?
25598,"No. Not yet. After all, a dragon... something out of old tales and legends... no one could have expected that."
25599,"Look, I already said Shadr doesn't owe me a thing, so get off my back."
25601,"That all happened in the First Era, so the well should be clear of poison by now. It says the key to the well is likely somewhere in the crypt."
25603,Noooo!
25606,"Only, she was gone. Shipped away to another orphanage, or adopted, or... I didn't know what else to do, so I came back, hoping nobody noticed I left."
25609,"Then the Forsworn will be where they belong. In the mines, bringing us wealth."
25610,Let's see if this works...
25611,"Yes, yes. My staff, take it. Kill something pretty with it."
25613,"Did you say an ""elf"" and ""stars""? I hope you don't know what you're asking."
25614,Your blood is such a pretty shade of red!
25615,"Now, you try it Aia"
25616,But I don't do that stuff anymore. Father keeps catching me and then I get in trouble.
25618,"But at the same time, I don't dare refuse an invitation from Elenwen."
25619,Don't get any bright ideas.
25622,"Most of the time, people just forget I'm even here. That's why I hear so much good gossip."
25629,You want to walk away? Fine. But there's going to be no justice for that poor woman. No one to care what happened to her.
25631,"My mother always loved the sea. When I was young, we'd visit Solitude and watch the ships from the bluff. Ah... better times."
25632,Visitors to the city usually stay at the Silver-Blood Inn.
25634,I never did understand the local custom of simply leaving one's trash wherever is convenient...
25635,"He was one of the smelter workers. I used to have a job down there myself, casting silver ingots."
25638,"If something's being handed to you on a silver platter, then there's a catch... steal the platter instead. You get it?"
25639,"But somehow they're still here, and they're killing people."
25640,What good is a court mage if she refuses to fight? Where's your sense of duty?
25643,...must oil Mother soon... ...get all the hard to reach places...
25644,They're remnants of the old rulers of Markarth. Natives of the Reach. Followers of the old ways.
25645,"The last few pages seem to describe ""the failure of the Nightingales"" although it doesn't go into great detail."
25648,"I swore I was going to just give up, for my child's sake, but it's like my father's ghost is haunting me. Asking me ""Why?"""
25649,"If you ladies are finished bickering, there's much to be done."
25651,My eyes are sharp.
25653,"He was killed. Guards said it was just a madman, but everyone knew the murderer was a member of the Forsworn."
25655,"Well, even if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be learned here."
25660,"Oh, Klimmek..."
25661,"Well, then he's welcome to eat and drink at home, isn't he?"
25663,"Oh, we'll make sure it's emptied out by morning. You can trust us!"
25664,Please. I don't want to talk about it. All that blood.
25665,"You work hard, Daighre. Glad you have stayed with us."
25666,"I'm positive whatever I require will be revealed to me on its own, in due time."
25668,Thinking I need to train some more.
25671,"Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh, happy times! I can't wait to..."
25677,Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market?
25678,She had a room here. Might talk to the innkeeper about it.
25681,"Look, if I were you, I'd proceed carefully. Crossin' Maven is one of the first things you learn not to do when you're down here."
25685,I ain't lookin' to make friends.
25686,"Speak your mind, Bryling. You're among friends here."
25688,Lucan found the claw about a year after he opened the store. He never quite explained where he got it. He's a tricky one.
25690,"Ah, yes. Rented the nicest room we had for a whole month."
25694,"In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society."
25697,Lok...
25698,I have some preparations of my own to make. I'll meet you at the stone.
25700,Good. Don't fail me.
25701,I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway.
25702,"Hmmm. I don't think you've got enough to cover my expenses with Silver-Bloods, much less convince me give my words away."
25703,"Secondly, I want to take the fort here. Having a fortified position will make it easier for us to amass men for our ultimate attack on the capital."
25704,"You're right. Look at me, talking in circles like some old wise woman. Very well, outlander. You have my axe when you need it."
25705,"Well, you seem like the honest sort. Here you are."
25706,"I'll try to hold to your hopeful purpose. Quickly, before this encompassing fog once more snares me in the World-Eater's net."
25707,Is that right? Here's how the Legion deals with rebel scum like you.
25708,"Sorry. Margret might be dead, but the room's rented."
25710,"Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!"
25713,Are you serious? I say more threatening words to my husband.
25714,Why don't you take your coin and keep walking?
25715,"Hmph. Yes. Yes, I surely can. It's not something I do lightly, mind you, and it's not as specific as you might want. But yes. I will do this for you."
25716,All right. I don't want any trouble. It's yours.
25719,Did you need anything else?
25722,"My job is to keep the Jarl safe, despite his best efforts."
25723,"Oh, good. She'll listen to you, I just know it."
25726,Yeah. So?
25727,I'm still looking for someone to deliver my message to Sibbi Black-Briar...
25728,Thank you for asking.
25731,"This is it, you know. Through this door. Can you feel it?"
25732,So be it. I'm sure Arkay will find it in his heart to forgive you... eventually.
25733,I asked the question because I was hoping you might be able to help me recover something I've lost.
25734,It was the Forsworn from Broken Tower. Never been much trouble before. What's it to you?
25735,"She... she said that? She said those words... to you?  ""Darkness rises when silence dies""?"
25736,"Remember, this isn't Stormcloak territory. If we're ahead of the news from Helgen we should be fine as long as we don't do anything stupid."
25737,We also keep a constant vigil against those who practice the vile arts of necromancy.
25738,Priests of Arkay such as myself perform rites for the dead and sometimes console the bereaved.
25739,"Well, as I said, Arkay is the god of life and death. You'll find his temples and Halls of the Dead all across Tamriel."
25740,"Take the giant's hammer to Atub, and tell her what has happened here."
25741,My old bones don't hurt so much now.
25742,"Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true daughter of Skyrim, or you're not."
25744,Speak. I will listen.
25746,"Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true son of Skyrim, or you're not."
25747,"Oh, really?"
25750,"Think you've got the mettle, eh?"
25753,And we'll cleave through the Legion to get to them.
25755,I hope one comes running up here so I can stab it right in the face.
25756,See if you can unlock that door.
25757,A parent should never outlive a child. Having my daughter's spirit here... it's as if she never died.
25758,That's a load off my mind. Here's your pay.
25759,Skyrim is the birthplace of humanity. The birthplace of honor. And those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor.
25760,"I want to pay you, but I had to cover up the murder. Didn't expect you to go on a killing spree."
25762,"Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally."
25764,"You mean Ulfric's so-called ""Stormcloak rebellion""?"
25769,I'll be at the market come morning. You better be there too.
25771,"Good. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to do this. "
25772,"We are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim, and Ulfric... he's the truest of us all."
25776,"Of course, Jarl Balgruuf. You seem to have found me an able assistant."
25777,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
25778,"Ahh, going for the mysterious and brooding thing, hmm?"
25779,But you're right. Victory is within our grasp. We can afford to give the Empire one more chance to withdraw.
25780,Bye.
25781,Look at you. Such a devoted student of Restoration.
25783,"If you are, then you make your way to Windhelm and talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly."
25785,What? You left him on his own? With the Thalmor after him? Go make sure he's safe and bring him here!
25786,Now then. I assume you know about...
25787,"Let us sleep, sweet Arkay, by your side. Let no harm come to us."
25789,So. You were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes?
25790,"Sorry, no time to talk. I need to keep playing."
25794,"The Legion's always looking for strong, capable warriors. If you think you've got what it takes, our headquarters is in Solitude."
25796,"Going way back to King Harald's time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It was the symbol of his might and power. "
25797,Something has to change soon or I may as well pack this place up and leave it for the skeevers.
25799,Be careful not to fall on your way out.
25800,Go on in.
25804,"My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do."
25805,"I don't care what you're doing, after what happened you're lucky I don't toss you in jail. Now get lost."
25808,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
25810,The Palace of the Kings in which you now stand is one of the last buildings that remain from that era.
25811,"Not now, Braith."
25812,"Windhelm is one of the oldest human cities in all of Tamriel. In fact, it was the capital of the First Empire, which was founded by Ysgramor"
25817,But I've heard from the Snow-Shods that they intend to burn this place to the ground!
25818,"Well, a few reasons come to mind."
25821,I cannot thank you enough for all of the help.
25824,Let's just hope that doesn't happen.
25825,"I'm supposed to allow you to trade in one of your pieces of Guild armor, so what will it be?"
25830,Rogatus and I have been married over 50 years. He's always been a bit of a grouch.
25836,"Talos guide you, lad."
25839,Eh? Did you say something?
25840,"Wait. General, you don't intend to just hand over Markarth to that... traitor!"
25841,It's off to Cidhna Mine for you.
25842,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Whiterun.
25843,We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
25844,"Look at me when I'm talking to you, eh?"
25848,"Your payment, my friend. Well done."
25852,"Hey, jailor! What I don't understand is why you're siding with the Imperials."
25853,"Excellent. Thank you, I'll see that this gets put to good use."
25855,Our struggle is our people's struggle.
25856,Tough luck for you then. Come back when you have at least one of the pieces.
25857,Blood on the wind today. Good hunt ahead of us.
25860,I was hoping you'd offer. I didn't think it was my place to ask such a favor of you. I thank you.
25862,You call yourself a warrior?
25865,Hurry! Before Alduin your life devours bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!
25866,"Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you."
25869,You'll see! It was a dragon! It'll kill us all and then you'll believe me!
25870,"Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way."
25871,"No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true daughter of Skyrim and'll know what to do."
25874,"That can have interesting results. Some victims may flee, others may cower in fear. "
25876,"The Flagon was once a city beneath a city. We had our own smith, our own alchemist... you name it."
25878,"The war keeps most folks away, these days."
25879,"I have no idea what happened. Ancano did it, I think."
25883,"That doesn't mean I support everything the Empire's been doing lately, but Nords have never been fair-weather friends."
25885,We'll chat after the ceremony.
25889,"Riften, eh? Probably down in the Ratway, then. It's where I'd go."
25890,"I own the lumber mill, and pay a fair wage. See my husband Hod if you're looking for work."
25891,"Ulfric murdered Torygg, you know. Walked right into his palace in Solitude and killed him. Shouted him to death, if you believe the stories."
25892,"Ah, I forget you're new to Skyrim. Jarl Elisif, I should say, although only because she was married to Jarl Torryg when he was murdered."
25894,"Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind..."
25897,You must be lost. The tavern is down the road a piece.
25898,"It was as big as the mountain, and black as night. It flew right over the barrow."
25900,Damned wizards and their damned magic...
25901,I only counsel caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in times like these.
25903,What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruuf is not receiving visitors.
25906,"As housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that threaten the Jarl or his people. So you have my attention. Now, explain yourself."
25909,There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.
25911,Guess we'll have two more mouths to feed for a while.
25914,"At times like this, I truly appreciate the joys of a warm fire and a stiff drink."
25915,"Whatever you have to say to the Jarl, you can say to me."
25916,All that remains is to ensure the safe return of the Skeleton Key.
25917,"Good, the place is crawling with bandits.  We lost some good men trying to take it earlier."
25918,Just remember me if you get your hands on anything else.
25920,Perhaps. Perhaps not.
25921,"You'll never be in charge of this family with that attitude, loving husband."
25922,"Then like Roggvir, you're a Nord at heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand."
25923,"It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what she has to say."
25924,"It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to say."
25926,The Voice? Here?
25927,Let's go tell the others.
25930,"Now having an Orc for a wife would be something, yes. Strong and bulky. Too bad they don't let people go beyond the walls."
25931,It seems like Dorthe grows a head taller every season.
25932,I've had enough troubles recently. What is it that you're after?
25935,Die damnit!
25940,"Great, back to the fight."
25941,"I work steel, weapons mostly."
25943,"No time to talk now, my friend. No time. Out mistress needs tending. Keeping."
25944,"If talking your way out of trouble isn't enough, you could always pick up some training from Delvin, Vex or Vipir."
25945,"Arch-Mage Aren assures me that his people had nothing to do with it, and I believe him. But Winterhold never recovered."
25946,Keep walking.
25948,"And besides myself, Delvin, Niruin and Vipir can help you with any sort of training you might need to sharpen your skills."
25949,"If you're ever in need of some quick coin for items you find on the job, Tonilia is the best fence around."
25952,I also suggest you spend some time in the trainin' room. Just talk to Vipir. He'll show you around.
25954,What's become of us? We used to be inseparable... always fighting back to back and letting nothing stand in our way.
25955,"Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived for so long. "
25956,"If you're lookin' to get some coin for the fruits of your labor, you should talk to Tonilia. She sounds tough, but she'll cut you a fair deal."
25957,"Skald, if you don't mind sir, I have a request."
25959,"Where else would I want to be but here? Learning from them, fighting at their sides."
25960,"You've betrayed me, murdered my sister and massacred my men!"
25962,But we haven't taken a side because it's not our fight.
25963,"Well, then I'll just stay behind you a little bit, and follow along quietly."
25964,Always have your shield at the ready.
25965,"Sorry isn't good enough, Orthus. There's a lot of gold at stake here, and sniveling isn't going to get it back."
25967,Forsworn have troubled the Reach for too long. I intend to deal with them.
25968,Agh! Who did this?
25973,"I can also provide a few supplies useful to our trade now and again, for a small fee."
25974,"I'm the fence down here. You come by anything you don't exactly own and I'll pay you some coin for it. Minus a little slice for the Guild, of course."
25977,"Sure, how about I get Dirge to knock you over your head and dump you into the cistern?"
25980,Got my hands full as usual.
25981,"Here's your armor, just make sure you put it to good use."
25984,Are you crazy? What were you thinkin'? You can't just go around doin' things the way you please!
25985,"That thing's evil, Lynly! I told you to keep away from there!"
25986,I don't think so.
25988,Now you die!
25989,It was on a job a few years back... it was supposed to be a simple burglary on a house in Windhelm.
25992,"Lost it? Well, at least you showed signs of initiative by telling me."
25993,I hear Adonato Leotelli's staying up in Windhelm. I've read a few of his works. Be good to meet him someday.
25995,"Look, here. In the third panel."
25996,We should keep moving.
25997,"Fletching suits me. It's difficult, and sometimes tedious. But a well made arrow strikes forth like the fury of a god."
25998,"You blind, boy? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that."
25999,Good! I've got a few scores to settle.
26000,"You can tell Cicero I'll be along presently. I just need to do a couple things here first, and gather my tools."
26001,Watch it!
26002,"Or perhaps you should crawl back into whatever swamp you came from, lizard man."
26007,Huh?
26011, 
26017,"She wishes to speak to you herself. Please. Place your hands on the altar, and you will hear her voice."
26020,"You see - Paar-thur-nax - a Thu'um - a Shout, yes?"
26021,"Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always made up of three Rotmulaag - Words of Power."
26022,"Leave me alone, Braith..."
26023,Last night I saw Lod the blacksmith writing a letter. Probably sending word to Solitude and General Tullius.
26024,"Laila, Riften is my home, but if my meadery can't be safe here, I'll just move it elsewhere."
26026,"But Odahviing, he is... headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the dov, he was known for this."
26027,"Farm work is hard work. It's good to relax when I can, but I still have to listen to my brothers harping about ""injustices."""
26028,"He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature. Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin."
26029,"The Companions are the oldest, most honored band of warriors in Skyrim. Whiterun was built around their hall, Jorrvaskr."
26030,Argonian Ale! I can almost taste it!
26031,This is the longest day I can remember.
26032,Leave me.
26035,We've almost got it!
26036,"If we can just find out what this Dragonrend Shout is, you may have a chance."
26037,That's it!
26038,You're welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his papers stashed in his desk.
26042,You might as well have some sweets. I made them for the festival after all.
26045,Steady now!
26046,"What do you want, lizard?"
26050,I will conquer where Alduin failed.
26054,Kynareth humbles us with her beauty.
26055,It is the power of old! The Voice of the Dragonborn!
26056,What would you ask of me?
26057,"I've done my part, Dragon Bridge will have extra guards. Falk Firebeard will find a way to take care of the cave."
26059,"What was that you said, venomous wife of mine?"
26060,Faaz! Nah!
26061,Dovahkiin! Here I am!
26062,Damn dragon!
26064,Coming right up.
26066,Remember - don't trust the Imperials. No matter what honeyed lies they tell you.
26070,Our ancient debt for Alduin's reprieve is now repaid - the long night is ended!
26072,I should bring some of these Dwemer artifacts to the Arcane University in Cyrodiil for study.
26073,Good day.
26074,I think I may wait until the Burning of King Olaf to have and Spiced Wine.
26075,The Jarl's down!
26076,Housecarl! No!
26077,We thought it would be so simple.
26079,Atmah cried to herself. Hafnar wouldn't look at either of us. And I kept telling them it would be all right.
26082,"Yes, sir."
26083,What is the meaning of this?
26084,"We're wise to your scheming, you coward."
26085,"What would you have me do, woman? Cross the Guild? Take them all on one by one?"
26086,"Got ourselves a freelancer thinks he can muscle in on our territory. How about you teach him some manners, eh?"
26087,"You're under the arrest, for the Murder of Susanna of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest. "
26088,Right. Till next time.
26089,Has the whole city lost their brains?
26090,"Drem Yol Lok. Greetings, wunduniik. I am Paarthurnax."
26092,Get him out of my sight.
26094,I can feel you laughing behind my back.
26095,Lone travelers can find these woods a little treacherous.
26096,I'm proud of my farm. It takes no small effort to grow crops in this part of Skyrim.
26097,"Yes, sir!"
26098,"I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me."
26099,"This is the College of Winterhold, a safe haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge."
26100,"Well met, traveler."
26101,"Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about."
26102,"This isn't over, Jorleif! "
26104,In you go.
26105,Dorthe won't eat that. Are you trying to starve the child?
26106,You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a daughter of Skyrim.
26107,The people of Morthal would much rather weave their own horrid tales about my life than simply ask me for the truth.
26108,"Ay, it is.  I suppose it won't hurt the girl to eat it this once."
26112,Just never you mind about that.
26113,Can the sawmill handle those logs? They look a might big.
26114,"Ay, it can. Wouldn't want them any bigger though."
26115,And the blade?
26116,Gettin' dull. We'll need a new one soon.
26117,It's the rebels! Defend the entrance!
26118,"How's about a drink, Hod."
26119,You'll be wantin' me to pay for them?
26120,It's only right seein' as your the important lumber man.
26121,"Confound it, boy, I know what I'm doing. It will help me determine the season of his burial, which I can cross-reference."
26122,"Yeah, if your interested then I'll give you the book for free. If you like it you can come back later and I'll have other stuff."
26125,"J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves, but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he. J'zargo comes out on top."
26127,Release...me.
26128,Hsss...
26129,"Same as the others. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart."
26131,"Do not dishonor or attempt to harm Elisif in any way. Adhere to that rule, and you'll be fine."
26132,Uhhh.
26133,"I'll be sure and have everything ready. This is exciting, isn't it?"
26134,Please do let me know if you change your mind.
26135,"Then you are fool, and will die for it."
26136,Now you. You can call me Ann Marie.
26139,Go. Do what has to be done.
26141,"I've tried repeatedly to eradicate that meddler, but he has ears within the city guard. Gives us the slip every time we raid the warehouse."
26142,"They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else."
26143,"Perhaps not the brightest spot in Skyrim's history, eh?"
26144,That way it was always ready for the next inevitable victim.
26147,I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun. 
26152,"Not much, I'm afraid. It was named Kahvozein's Fang after the dragon worshipped by this particular sect of the cult."
26154,Stay away from me!
26156,I suggest you put away your weapon. Wouldn't want to cause a... scene.
26157,"Then, if you should happen upon the corpse of a dragon, you should be able to use it to slice off a heartscale or two."
26158,Can't hide from me.
26160,"That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood is itself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift."
26163,I can take you!
26164,And that's it. I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the tome. Use it well!
26165,This is preposterous. Disrespect... insulting! I am tired of being hounded from all sides!
26166,"Wonderful, just wonderful!"
26167,"If I'm not being clear enough, that means we don't want him killed."
26168,"What did you say to me, Reachman?"
26169,"Here, then, is the first of the Illusion spells you sought."
26172,"Don't go setting the place on fire, okay?"
26173,May your bed be warm and your food sweet.
26175,"I feared she'd befallen the same fate, ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal."
26176,Karliah... she's still alive?
26177,"That clumsy maid at the palace spilled wine on my best suit. Sister, I believe it's time for a replacement."
26178,"Actually, there is, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out."
26179,"In my youth I was a fisherman... I had a beautiful ship named ""The Brawny Prawn."" But the years have a way of creeping up on you."
26182,Can we both be chiefs?
26184,"With Nilsine dead, maybe then Tova will realize what she's lost, hmm? Maybe then she'll see that I was just as much a daughter as the others."
26187,"Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner."
26188,"These fruits and vegetables are disappointing, Carlotta."
26190,"I get them fresh from the farms daily, Nazeem."
26191,"Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do?"
26192,"If you were getting them from my farm, they'd be twice as fresh."
26193,This Khajiit guards the others.
26197,"I am under no obligation to tell you anything. Now, leave me at once and never mention that you saw me."
26198,"Praise to you, champion!"
26200,You picked quite a day for a trip to Markarth.
26201,"So little is known about the Elder Scrolls, almost anything is possible where they're concerned. Artifacts of truly inconceivable power."
26202,You picked quite a day for a trip to Solitude.
26203,It got bad back in Cyrodiil. The war with the Thalmor ruined... everything.
26204,"But this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm..."
26206,"Well of course, not with an attitude like that!"
26208,Any luck getting the marks from those men?
26209,Better bundle up. This may keep up for a while.
26214,At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.
26215,I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.
26216,"Oh, look at the colors!"
26217,Come on. Let's go see if there's a mythical dragon buried up there.
26218,"He only cares about this stupid town, but Bassianus makes me happier than anyone ever has."
26219,"I hope you have coin to spend, and you're not just here to gawk at my goods."
26220,Why is it always raining?
26223,"Meantime, you best steer clear of me."
26225,"This here's the Darkwater. Comes down from Lake Honrich into the White River, a few miles downstream. Good fishing, I hear."
26226,Nice weather for a ride. Hope it lasts.
26229,"What would you have me do, Hrongar? Your brother is the Jarl. You know I can't question his judgement."
26231,Couldn't ask for better weather.
26232,It's almost getting downright hot out now.
26233,The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him.
26234,"Steady, old girl."
26237,"You'll find Windhelm's full of dark elves. The kind from Morrowind, you know. Not that I have anything against them, long as they keep to themselves."
26238,"You might run into some of them lizard-folk in Riften. Quite a few of them work the docks there, not sure why. Like swimming in the lake, maybe."
26241,"We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!"
26244,I don't want to be hurt again!
26245,"Please, I need help! I don't want to die on this damned log!"
26246,"Once you have it, I want you to place it in Brand-Shei's pocket without him noticing."
26248,I'm willing to let the Dragonborn be the judge of the fairness of my request.
26249,"Not very good quality, is it? Probably came from the Gray Quarter. Have a talk with Revyn Sadri."
26250,"That amulet. I've seen the Nords wear these when they're looking to marry. With your strength, you should have no trouble."
26251,"You'll want to watch out for the Forsworn if you do any travelling around the Reach. Bloodthirsty bastards, them."
26252,"Solitude's a big port town, you know? Full of sailors and their tales of far away lands. Most of 'em's foreigners and liars, of course."
26253,"Ever been to Windhelm? Oldest city in Skyrim, by some accounts. They say the big old palace there was built by Ysgramor himself."
26254,"You'll never see the sun again, you hear me? No one escapes Cidhna Mine."
26256,"Listen up, spy! You're trapped in here, and we have your accomplice."
26259,"Well, it appears your actions are startin' to make waves out there. People are talkin' about the Guild again."
26260,"My intention was to spend the rest of my years here, burying the past and praying for forgiveness."
26261,"By then, Burguk had already become chief, and he welcomed me home as family, not a rival as is tradition."
26262,Welcome! Allow me to recommend the Black-Briar Mead... the purest brew in all of Skyrim!
26265,Look out!
26266,"Gee up, there!"
26267,We're not fighting we're just.... Why don't I get you something to eat? Mama and papa will talk later.
26268,I don't know if we can outrun 'em.
26270,Watch out!
26271,"Look out, I think we have company."
26272,"Lead on, then."
26273,"Well, seems like you have a bit of gold left in your pockets, don't you, my friend?  Mmm, yes..."
26274,Ro!
26275,"Believe, believe, the Dragonborn comes."
26276,"You're trying my patience, lass."
26277,"Anything I can do for you, I will."
26278,We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of different functions all working in tandem to keep us alive.
26279,Trust Septimus. He knows you can know. 
26280,"One day when you can see past your own interests, you will come to see that we were right."
26284,Some old priest buried here long ago.  I've been searching for his tomb for a few years now.
26286,Find Mzark and its sky-dome. The machinations there will read the Scroll and lay the lore upon the cube.
26287,I'm not sure I like these Alik'r warriors hiding out here. They seem like trouble.
26288,Wait... I know you.
26290,Why don't you have yourself a drink at the Moorside before you head back?
26291,Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life.
26292,Stormcloak scouts are making it difficult to move around. It's good you made it here in one piece.
26294,It's been so long since we've had any contact with the Greybeards. Do you really have the Voice?
26296,Glad you were here. 
26298,"You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help."
26300,"It's not easy running messages, what with Imperials scouts crawling all over the place. Well done."
26303,"Ah, good. Looks like the reinforcements for the fort are on the way. And we have some information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent."
26304,"Did you raise your prices, Carlotta?"
26306,"Oh! Um, he he... Hold on... I... I can explain..."
26309,I didn't say anything about giving up.
26312,"Laelette was told to burn mommy and me, but she didn't want to."
26314,"Well, at least allow me to reward you for your uncanny foresight."
26315,"First, I need to get a handle on rebel operations. Need to discretely liberate some documents from their headquarters."
26316,I saw it first! I'm taking it.
26317,"What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study."
26319,Haafingar seems to have trouble keeping their prisoners in line.
26320,"Spoken like a true Nord. I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn."
26321,You won't leave here alive!
26323,My duties keep me busy in Markarth. I don't know if I can help you.
26324,"Oh yes, I was once brother to the Companions. Let's just say they found my methods ""unsettling."" The Dark Brotherhood, obviously, feels differently. "
26325,"The idiot got lost in the mist and ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom."
26326,Kill me if you must. But I can't promise I won't haunt you till the end of your days if... if the Dread Lord lets me. Ha ha ha ha ha.
26327,"I want to help you, Dragonborn. And I will. But I need your help first."
26330,You trying to hide? 'Cause I can see you plain as day.
26333,"And there are the villains - those that misused their power. There's always a choice, and there's always a risk."
26334,I'm preparing to leave for the standing stone. What is it?
26339,"My men will be ready when you are, Dragonborn. You have a truce to arrange first, eh?"
26340,We need nothing from outsiders! Yamarz will provide for us.
26341,Okay! Let's play hide and seek. You find me and I'll tell you.
26342,"We'll be ready, don't worry. You do have a plan for actually luring a dragon into this trap, don't you?"
26343,"As I promised, my men stand ready. The great chains are oiled. We wait on your word."
26344,"So this is what passes for Imperial craftsmanship. Try not to sneeze, or you might bring the whole fort down."
26346,"Destroy Vighar, my long dead vampire ancestor. Have you changed your mind?"
26347,"Among ourselves, of course. Mu ni meyye. None were yet ready to openly defy him."
26348,"Here, take the Goldenglow Estate Deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more to him alive."
26349,Some of them might try. But that's not what I'm worried about.
26350,"I had no choice, don't you see?"
26352,"A dragon... here in Skyrim. What's this world coming to? First the war, now dragons... trouble loves company, they say..."
26355,You're dead! Dead!
26357,You think Stormcloaks and Legionnaires are dangerous? Ha!
26358,"You're right, I saw it. Didn't want to believe my own eyes, is all."
26359,"Unfortunately, we've had to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems with the local Nords."
26361,"Suddenly the nobles are calling for a new Jarl, and all the while their pockets are jingling with the sound of Imperial septims."
26364,Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back - you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.
26366,"Oh, for the love of Mara, would you please just go?"
26367,No time to talk. Out of my way.
26370,"No, dear sister. We do not."
26372,The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...
26373,"Several of his ancestors belonged to the Mythic Dawn, the cult that almost destroyed Tamriel."
26376,"I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, Grelod has been so angry."
26378,You looking for something or what?
26379,"Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such... Wait, it can't be."
26380,A witchhunter from the Priesthood of Stendarr is in town. He's asking a lot of questions about that old abandoned house.
26381,Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Word.
26383,You realize this is exactly what they wanted.
26384,What who wanted?
26386,"It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?"
26387,Heh.
26388,He's not a werewolf any more? Even dead? This is a good thing! 
26391,We aren't the bad guys you know.
26393,"It is the last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you."
26395,Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?
26396,May the gods preserve you.
26398,Ha! Found you!
26400,"Sorry, boss. Had to use your share to cover expenses after you done and got messy."
26401,You just said it yourself.
26402,It makes us right.
26403,"Oh, Rogatus! Maybe tomorrow will be pleasant for once, hmm? It can't be terrible every day!"
26405,And if I surrender?
26406,That Empire is dead. And so are you. 
26408,"Oh look, it's little baby Battle-Born."
26409,So be it.
26410,"If the stones were remounted on the crown, it would be of great benefit to the Thieves Guild."
26411,If you say so.
26413,"Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?"
26414,"Rescue? No one knew where I was, when I was taken. Who sent you?"
26415,"So, Roggi, when are you going to get yourself a woman?"
26416,"Well, that's good to know. I suggest you tell your people at the College to keep a tighter leash on their mages."
26417,An apple to keep you healthy? A tomato to keep you strong? Surely you need one or the other...
26418,It will be our little nest. I'll be waiting for you there.
26420,Vittoria! There's someone I'd like you to meet.
26424,"I damn well hope so. If it helps you twist them up, I'm glad to help."
26426,Farewell.
26431,"Song or not, I just want it done."
26432,"Everyone knows it's the College's fault that the sea swallowed our city. Still they deny it, but we all know the truth."
26437,As you wish.
26441,"The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself."
26444,"Honored to see you again, my Thane."
26446,"I'll let you in if you agree to something for me. There's a giant spider in Nchuand-Zel. My workers call her ""Nimhe,"" the poisoned one."
26447,It brought me all the way to these frozen reaches from the warm embrace of Summerset Isle.
26450,"As you wish. This moment, we three, will be immortalized in song."
26451,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
26452,It does not.
26455,"Please. I must remain uninterrupted if I am to complete the ritual. Have no fear, your time will come."
26456,"Dragonborn. Here, use my sword to do it. This moment will be immortalized in song. Make it a good kill."
26458,Enough... enough...
26460,"Worst thing is, nobody wants them in the cities. Nobody trusts them."
26462,"Sorry, my scaly friend, you've come to the wrong place. Around here we don't ignore what's happening in the world."
26463,"And if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one who can stop them."
26464,"Hey, Unblooded."
26465,"That journal means a lot to me, if you find it."
26467,My mother and father yell a lot. Always have.
26469,"Sulla look, the passage is open, wait... there's someone down there!"
26470,"Yes, sir. I've been trying to quiet her, but she's insistent. She thinks she can find out who's been killing the women..."
26472,"Sulla, let's just get out of here. Hasn't there been enough death?"
26474,"You've seen them? Then waste no time, head there at once!"
26475,I'm hoping to run my own inn someday.
26477,Halt! City's closed with the dragons about. Official business only.
26479,Thanks again for delivering those supplies to the Greybeards.
26481,"The Jarl will definitely want to talk to you. You'll find him in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill."
26482,I caught a glimpse of that captured dragon. It's.. beautiful. In its own way.
26485,It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone.
26486,"Riverwood's in danger, too? You'd better go on in. You'll find the Jarl in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill."
26488,"Five. Our leader, Paarthurnax, lives alone on the peak of the Throat of the World."
26489,"I thought Enmon and Mean had a little girl, but I haven't seen her in a while."
26491,I just want to make clear that the only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
26492,"They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible."
26494,Speak to Yamarz. Convince him to let you help him.
26495,"Welcome to Whiterun, friend. Go right on in. "
26496,It's got to be somewhere around here! Now where did I put it?
26498,You. Weapon. Away. Now!
26499,"You could challenge Burguk, my brother. Yours is the stronger swordarm."
26501,"Well done! I don't know where I'd be without you, my old friend."
26503,"People to see and places to go, huh? Later, then."
26505,"I was just wondering. The next time we meet, do you think maybe you could teach me some fire magic? Nothing dangerous! Maybe a candle lighting spell?"
26507,"Ah yes, my matchmaker. What is it I can do for you?"
26508,Or else what? You think you can stand against the entire Whiterun city guard? The gate's closed.
26509,"There are thieves and then there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all. He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time."
26510,Safe travels.
26512,"So you saw a dragon, did you? Tell me, what was it like? As big as a house?"
26516,"We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice."
26517,These bandits would stab each other in the back if it meant an extra coin in their pockets.
26519,"He's afraid of being taken as well, so he hasn't left the house. All he talks about is Thorald."
26520,"Oh yes, many times. But mighty Talos was my keeper, my shield against the heresy of the south!"
26522,What's this? It thinks it can just throw refuse wherever it likes?
26526,You'll want to talk to Legate Rikke. She deals with the new recruits.
26528,"All right, let's not overdo it."
26529,Can I get you a drink?
26534,"Of course! I know, today wasn't the best introduction to the Legion, but I hope you'll give us another chance."
26539,But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their purpose.
26541,"Hanse was in line to be High King of Skyrim, you know. Having that might get the ear of the other Holds and give me some authority."
26544,Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else.
26545,"Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up."
26551,Do not interrupt the ritual. Go empty the vessels and sit on the throne.
26552,I'll throw some money at you. Good enough?
26554,"He provided the funds to start this caravan, and put me in charge of it. I owe him more than I could ever hope to repay."
26556,"Smithing isn't the most exciting thing for me, but we all have to lend a hand as best we can."
26557,"Ah, look at the pretty, shiny coins. Now, how best to spend them?"
26559,"You would? Well then, I would insist on rewarding you for your time."
26562,The General has sent me to obtain a powerful weapon for the war effort.
26563,"Seen the remnants of the grove? That... well, that was me. Me and my sister."
26564,But I still hear the call of the blood.
26566,"And with that, the tour is over. I thank you for your patronage, and I hope to see you again soon!"
26571,I hope this isn't something I did.
26572,Let's try a lute piece. Follow along...
26575,Hmm?
26576,"Give me what you can't live without, and I'll make sure to get it into the Embassy. The rest is up to you."
26577,Come see my collection of Gray-Mane's finest trinkets! You'll not find their like in all Tamriel!
26578,"Keep clear of the College, and keep yourself out of trouble."
26579,Does the journal say where this wealth came from?
26580,Are those two at it again?
26581,Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.
26582,"Although, come to think of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there."
26583,"Anything else, Enthir? Anything about... the Nightingales?"
26584,Help!
26585,"You are looking after your brother, yes?"
26587,Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak before heading back?
26588,They are. Except the gem is always consumed. They're frail. Except for one.
26589,I trust you've applied the appropriate pressure in order to change their mind?
26591,Shadows preserve us. So it's true...
26595,"I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to have to ask that you continue to trust me."
26598,I knew he was telling the truth. I always can tell.
26599,"Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own."
26601,Secure the door.
26602,Do you feel that?
26603,"We all come into Arkay's light in the end, but there's no need to rush."
26604,"They got used to Idgrod just fine, didn't they? So what's the difference?"
26605,Vex! Put it away... right now.
26607,You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will assuredly fall to the Dominion.
26609,"Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today."
26611,"The Empire is weak, obsolete. Look at how far we've come and with so little."
26612,Get over to our camp in Hjaalmarch. We need to strengthen our defensive position.
26614,He has given up. But I have not.
26615,"Oh, look. It's the entrance to a dwarven city. I've heard stories...."
26617,But now he's dead... and I have a new loincloth.
26618,"They live here too, my Jarl. That's what I'm telling you."
26619,You're free to leave.
26620,"I am the perfect weapon. My innocent, childish form grants me nearly unrestricted access. Poison or a good bite usually takes care of the rest."
26622,Careful. They might put you away if you don't at least put on some pants.
26624,"You go on your way now, boy."
26625,I found them near the old Dwemer bridge in the far west. I'll mark it down for you on your map for a small fee.
26629,I killed scores of the Empire's men before I was forced to surrender.
26630,This is the Skyrim you want?!
26631,"Mara this and Mara that. Where is she when hundreds of Stormcloaks are dying for no good reason, eh?"
26632,"Damnit woman, stand aside."
26635,Did you hear? The Hall of the Dead is closed. Brother Verulus isn't the most popular man in town right now.
26637,"We had some trouble, while back. Stormcloak tried to set the mill on fire. But we sorted her out."
26640,Are you all right? Did you see what happened?
26643,"Regardless, I'm making you a very simple offer. You get me the staff, and I give you Onmund's precious amulet. Do we have a deal?"
26644,"Thank you, Thonar. That's generous of you to say."
26646,The blessing of Arkay be upon you.
26648,You speak the truth.
26649,"Yes, champion of Azura?"
26650,"However, I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to keep you safe if you're willing to help me."
26651,"My little Friga loved to cook, but she was terrible at it. Then one day, out of nowhere, she made the most amazing leek soup."
26652,Always was a stubborn woman. She's not going to stand down.
26653,Grrh!
26655,"What next, giant snakes?"
26658,"You're a cold hearted bastard, aren't you?"
26660,"If that must be, then it will. And why should I be any different? How many the lives already lost. What's one more?"
26663,Nothing I can't handle.
26666,"Aye, I'll hate it, but I'll do it if I have to."
26668,"I'll be glad when this beast is gone from here. Do whatever it is you need to do with it, Dragonborn."
26669,We're almost there. I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!
26670,"Implicate and kill his son Gaius, and the commander will be grief-stricken and humiliated, his family name ruined. The security plan will then fail."
26671,"Sir, there continues to be unrest in the Gray Quarter."
26674,The bloodiest beef in the Reach.
26675,"Oh, and one final thing..."
26676,"Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest."
26677,You fool. You don't stand a chance.
26678,"If this truce will help the Dragonborn here put an end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric."
26682,"Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current clothes."
26683,I can't believe that worked!
26684,"May they journey forth together in this life and the next, in prosperity and poverty, and in joy and hardship."
26685,Of course. Just bring it to me when you find it.
26686,Did you hear that?
26690,"Playing tonight, Ogmund? Everyone here is anxious to hear the old ballads performed by the True Skald of the Reach."
26691,"Oh, you again."
26693,Indeed it is.
26694,I haven't been touched like that since I visited a certain brothel in the city of Sentinel...
26695,"Okay. I need to get back to the palace soon, anyway. "
26696,"You'll find tonics, salves, poultices and potions on my shelves. Browse to your heart's content."
26698,"I assure you, I'm prepared to make any deal."
26699,Almost there.
26702,"You here to apply at the Bards College? Well don't bother - you're too damned old. Start past four, and it's all wasted effort."
26705,"That wasn't a fight, it was an execution."
26707,"Bring whatever he's carrying to me, and I'll send you with convincing misinformation back to Dawnstar."
26708,"Ah, but without a doubt, the most compelling feature of this frozen wasteland is the volley of inane questions leveled at me on a regular basis."
26710,"If it's armor you need, we've got all kinds, both light and heavy."
26711,Rargh!
26712,I'll be happy to assist you if you'd like to purchase something.
26714,"Thank goodness mother is keeping a level head about everything. If my brother Saerlund had his way, we'd be flying Imperial colors by now."
26716,Don't make me tell you again. Get out of here.
26717,A few septims for my supper is all I ask.
26718,What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's tomb! Explain yourself!
26719,Spare a coin for a poor old beggar?
26721,"Take pity, sir, and spare me a few septims."
26723,You've done well.
26725,Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down.
26726,"Fresh-baked loaves, still warm from the oven!"
26727,Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale!
26729,"Bits and baubles for sale, all crafted by the best blacksmith in Skyrim."
26730,Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs!
26731,"Yes, we did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. Robbers were only after one thing."
26732,"He will come. He cannot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear us, even now?"
26733,Chops and steaks fit for a Jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
26734,"The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!"
26737,"Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it."
26739,Disgusting... beast!
26741,"Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of Succession."
26748,"Patience, sister. Patience."
26750,"But with the death of High King Torygg, the Festival has been declared ""in poor taste."" So it looks like it won't happen this year."
26751,One moment.
26752,The spiders put you through the ringer?
26753,I'm here to help.
26755,"Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it."
26756,"Why, just this last week I was commenting to my fellow meadery workers just how lucky we are to be working for such a charitable family."
26759,"Oh, half the field should do."
26760,This should shake the loyalty of the dov who serve him.
26763,Sentries! What do you see?
26765,Nobody allowed in. Ulfric Stormcloak's orders. Consider yourself warned.
26766,"I know you, Ulfric. You have no intention of coming to terms."
26767,Don't just stand there! Kill that thing!
26768,"We'll make it through, dear. We always do."
26769,"You want to stay here, fine. But the rest of us aren't giving up now."
26772,We'll come back for you as soon as we've reached our goal. You have my word.
26773,The trial awaits. Are you now prepared?
26775,"If you ever come back, I won't be so gracious."
26776,Oh dear. That wasn't supposed to happen.
26777,The circumstances differ. This time I have what you seek.
26778,"Dovahkiin, you call yourself? Arrogant mortal."
26779,Once again you have come seeking something.
26780,"Fastred, I wanted to talk with you."
26781,Arrogance will serve you poorly. Your worth must be determined before knowledge can be bestowed upon you.
26783,Then... it's over and my death wasn't in vain.
26787,Alduin sizaan midroti.
26788,"Survive, and you are worthy. This is the test put before you. Will you accept?"
26789,"You will rely on your skill as a mage. Not on your belongings, not on your scrolls and potions. Only what lies within."
26792,Just what have you gotten yourself involved in?
26793,"Shagrol, once the leader of this tribe, unhappy with his demise, has dealt with Malacath himself to curse me, curse us all."
26798,You want to know the one truth I've learned in all my years? Life's too hard to face sober.
26801,You will be called upon to rely solely on your Restoration spells.
26803,Divines know the mill could use some new blades. All right. It's yours. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
26806,You are not worthy!
26807,"I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help."
26808,"Well, I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell."
26809,"If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind."
26818, 
26820,Not here. Follow me.
26821,"First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few scales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one."
26822,Three in fact. They're my own recipe. Brought them over here from my days as a bartender in Gideon.
26823,"Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve individual scales off a dragon."
26824,"Don't listen to him. Ulfric's been telling lies about himself for so long, he's actually starting to believe them."
26825,"My knowledge of Skyrim's history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things."
26829,"You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now you're here, as if the very stars have finally aligned."
26831,What's happened? Did you find a way to learn the Dragonrend Shout?
26834,"I admire your restraint, but there are times when you must make decisions, even without all the facts. Rely on instinct."
26836,"He's been digging around the records the Blades left here, too. But we can talk about that later."
26837,Esbern should be able to help. He's spent his whole life poring over every old book he could find about dragons and that prophecy.
26841,"I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers."
26847,"As I've said, I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough."
26848,"You know, I took some classes at the Bards College as a youth. Poems come in handy when wooing."
26849,Amativ! Mu bo kotin stinselok.
26851,As for what she might like...
26852,Well... let's hear it.
26853,Not possible.
26855,You should probably just let Faleen read it herself. Don't want you stumbling over the words and ruining my flow.
26857,"If it can help us get inside the College, and reach Ancano, we'll have to hope that there's a way to stop all this."
26860,You call yourself a Nord?
26861,I hope we don't run into anything worse than Stormcloaks in here.
26862,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
26863,"By Sithis, you're not joking."
26865,"You want your share, don't you? Here you are, love."
26866,And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life.
26867,"The gold is flowing nicely. Here's your half of the profits, my dear."
26869,Good. It's done.
26871,I kind of like watching things from where I am. Making money is all I care about.
26872,Kyr's orders. Nobody goes in or out until he gets back. Or the boss will skin you soon as he's done with Ra'jirr.
26875,There she is!
26877,"You know, Dorthe, with all those vegetables I've been growing lately, I was thinkin' we could make a right lovely stew. Together. How about it?"
26878,Please take the Lexicon.
26882,Lead the way.
26883,I've got a bad feeling about this... something's just felt wrong down there lately. Eerie.
26885,Now you're sounding as crazy as the cat. Be going on about the Pale Lady next.
26887,"Hey, Redguard. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
26889,"Very well. It's not something often discussed, as it might be... misunderstood by the locals."
26891,"Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine."
26892,Damn Elves! You'll pay for this!
26894,"Hey, Argonian. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
26896,"Hey, dark elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
26898,"""Everyone will see it!"" she said. Of course! That was my problem with it."
26899,There should be a way to turn this off.
26900,By the Nine!
26903,Best we all forget about her. Bad luck to talk about the dead in Markarth.
26904,"I wasn't wanting to get anyone in trouble, sir. Just wanting to get the new planting started, is all."
26906,"Well, please let me know when you are."
26908,I'm glad there are guards outside the farm. I don't think I could defend the place alone.
26910,"A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of mine in Winterhold."
26911,You've already turned down a job that I had for you.
26914,And you're sure?
26916,"Good work. A simple job, but it keeps the coin rolling in. Here's your share."
26918,"There will be peace for a time, during which we must rebuild Skyrim into the land it once was. Strong. Self-reliant. The center of mankind."
26919,We Nords were proud warriors once. And we still could be. Evidenced by the men and women who fought and died bravely today.
26920,"It is more like the calm between storms. And the next storm, I think, will be far deadlier than the last."
26925,He said he loved me....
26926,I wish only to graduate and enroll with the Legion. My drums will lead our troops to victory.
26927,I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth.
26930,"I know plenty of spells that produce light, but stars? Hmm. There was that problem a few years ago, but that couldn't be related."
26931,"Die now, and live forever!"
26933,Careful with that.
26936,"Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to her steward, Falk Firebeard. He ordered a special bottle of Stros M'Kai Rum."
26940,"You've not heard of the Gourmet? Author of ""Uncommon Taste""? He's a wizard with a spatula. Well, not an actual wizard, but his recipes are legendary."
26941,"Oh, of course you want me to leave. Just waiting for me to turn my back. So you can have all the glory for yourself!"
26942,"Have you met my husband? Well don't bother, he's a drunk."
26943,Take your time. I understand your hesitation.
26946,Liar!
26947,"They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical."
26948,"You dirty, filching lizard!"
26952,"I still have research that keeps me busy, and being here in Winterhold ensures I have access to former colleagues."
26957,"But first, you were introducing yourself."
26958,I still can't believe he knew what he was doing when he opened that gate...
26960,"Jawanan, I don't see you here often."
26963,Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.
26964,A sale's a sale but I have to know... why are you buying something for Noster?
26965,"That's all I know, okay?"
26967,A war veteran should be respected.
26969,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
26970,"In the name of the Jarl, I'm ordering you to stand fast!"
26971,"How did you get it? No, never mind, I probably shouldn't know."
26972,"Guards and Jarls can be bought. And the Alik'r are close; I'm running out of time, so I'm choosing to trust you. "
26973,"Now, do you require assistance?"
26975,Haven't seen your face before. I'm watching you.
26977,"Fine, then. I guess some Dunmer are content to be their pets. "
26979,I appreciate the thought though.
26981,"But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice."
26982,"Fresh fish sounds like just the thing today, Addvar."
26983,I've been pushing the Salmon but I'll tell you the Slaughterfish is a bit better today.
26984,"Thank you, Addvar, I am picky about what I eat these days."
26985,"Calm yourself, Breya. We are closing in on the Lexicon. I can feel it calling. We'll continue without Drennen."
26986,I seem to have more chores for the Winking Skeever each day. I still have a delivery to do too.
26987,"You know, my father collected exotic alcohols. "
26988,Really?
26989,"Rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall and the like."
26990,Enough... of this!
26992,"We draw council at Japhet's Folly. The fools in Windhelm won't go near it, which is fine by us."
26993,"Thought it was fitting I suppose. I never changed it, because it never felt right to do so."
26996,"Yeah... sure. You, too, Delphine. You be safe."
26997,Don't have much to say unless you're here to mine metal.
26998,We've talked about speed and composure. Now we'll go over precision.
26999,Often times you won't be able to get as close to your prey as you'd like and you'll have to settle with a long shot.
27000,"However, with such a long shot, it's more than likely that's the only shot you'll be able to take before your prey runs off."
27001,A citizen of Whiterun has been kidnapped.
27002,I don't know if anyone else got out alive. I doubt I'd have made it out myself if not for my friend here.
27004,"You make an example of that gang, I'll give you a year's worth of pay."
27005,"If you find yourself in such a situation, then you need to make your shot count."
27006,I suppose you're right... they say it gets easier...
27009,"Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary."
27011,The Silver Hand. They finally found enough courage to attack Jorrvaskr.
27014,Namira grind your bones for my bread!
27015,"Avulstein Gray-Mane and I were best friends as children. If I see that traitor again, I'll throw him in jail myself!"
27016,The answer is simple. Orcs. There is a stronghold nearby whose hunters can butcher a deer in seconds.
27017,"We've actually stolen this item before and somehow it ended up back in some other mark's house. Guess it's time to reclaim it, eh?"
27020,We don't need no help from the Empire on that count.
27021,"You're going? I'll miss you, dear."
27022,You did it! All four targets in ten seconds. Nice job.
27023,How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?
27024,As you command.
27025,"In life, Hevnoraak drained his own blood from his body. His goal was to transfer his power back into himself after death, becoming a powerful lich."
27026,That's right. Used to explore all over. I'm the one who originally found the mine Darkwater Crossing was built around.
27027,How in the world did that happen?
27028,How unfortunate he has to dig through refuse like that. Someone should give him a piece of bread.
27029,"We've talked about composure, speed, and precision."
27031,"It may take you a couple of tries, but that's what practice is all about."
27033,But I thought there was only one chief.
27034,"Better them than us. We lost three good men to the traps up there, and for what- just to see another damn spider clanking around?"
27036,That's more gold than they're offering. Fine. I'll sell.
27037,"I made a lot of friends in a lot of ports, and the Thalmor approached me with a generous offer."
27038,Close...
27040,But... Eisa? She's smarter than that.
27041,"Excellent. Here, this is the key to the warehouse."
27042,But.. stealing the boss's sword? Did he have a death wish?
27045,"Bloody enough for you, outsider?"
27046,"Damn it, not now!"
27050,"Slow down, you have that special request in Windhelm to finish first. After that's done, I'll send you some more jobs."
27052,"Markarth is not without its problems, but the Empire is here to maintain order."
27053,"Take care of your armor, and it'll take care of you."
27055,You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Sister.
27057,"I don't much like this, I'll tell you. But you've saved my skin, so maybe I can overlook the past for now."
27060,"If you go to him, good luck."
27061,It's no fun getting pushed around all the time...
27062,The old man's got a good sense for people. He can look in your eyes and tell your worth.
27063,Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in Jorrvaskr.
27065,Ugh. You're the most disgusting merchant I have ever seen. The guards should take you away.
27069,Ugh! That it? That your best?
27070,"There is one possibility. But... no, the Jarl would never agree."
27071,That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.
27072,Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity to take on a giant.
27074,Is that so? I'll remember that next time we're in the mine tunnels... alone.
27076,You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?
27078,"And as Companions, our glory must always be hard-fought."
27080,Let's listen to Enthir's translation before we decide what we do.
27081,"We've got small weapons as well as big. Maces, daggers, that sort of thing."
27083,I have no business with you.
27084,"Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's seen to that."
27085,"Imperials, Stormcloaks... I don't care who's in charge around here. I just want to make money!"
27086,"Khajiit are not known as mages, so J'zargo has much to prove."
27087,I hate this game.
27088,"It's cold in the mine, but Thorgar really needs me, so I stay."
27090,"If he's willing, then we'll talk."
27092,"Enmon, dear, do you have any regrets? About letting her go?"
27093,Ha. Another milk drinker crying about his effort.
27095,I... won't... surrender!
27096,Anuriel seems to think that seeing me on the streets might bolster the city's morale.
27099,"Now, what is it you want?"
27103,Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to expect when we enter the cistern.
27105,"But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy."
27107,"I'm sorry, but you're not leaving alive."
27110,"Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!"
27113,And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. 
27115,"You're part of a family now, hamshank. I trust you... you trust me. Got it?"
27116,"But you must be anxious to get to work. I'm arranging a job, but need a bit more time. For now, go see Nazir. He's got several smaller contracts."
27118,"After the Oblivion Crisis was over, many felt that magic users were to blame. Elves, to be specific. It created a great deal of tension."
27119,"While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline."
27120,"Here, this key will provide access to my museum. Feel free to browse for as long as you wish."
27122,"But that's the kind of talk an old warhorse shouldn't be making. Don't worry. I have my problems with the Empire, but I'm still a soldier first."
27124,You best rethink this course of action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.
27126,Do you realize that at a snap of my fingers I can bring the entire Markarth city guard to my defense?
27127,"Be careful, you might find more than just King Olaf's Verse in Dead Man's Respite."
27129,Tomorrow. I'll let you know tomorrow.
27130,Oh... well... I can see you have no appreciation for scholarship.
27134,"You tempt me mightily, Alva. But I won't cuckhold another man, even on murderer like Hroggar."
27135,"I'm sure that, in time, this little sapling will grow into a new Gildergreen that will tower over Whiterun. Thank you. "
27137,We mustn't tarry... the Skull needs to be destroyed as soon as possible.
27139,Don't come any closer. I don't want Kynareth to think I'm on your side.
27140,"Urog and I still hunt a lot, so it's not like I'm cooped up in the longhouse."
27142,"Wherever I can find them. If you're the type who worries over where something came from, you may want to move on."
27146,Aiiiiiiiieeeeee!
27147,I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect.  
27150,"Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage."
27151,"No, you can't ever be too paranoid where the Thalmor is concerned. Look what happened to the Blades. The Blades!"
27152,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
27154,"Hey, melon nose!"
27155,"Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me."
27158,I'm told they're the ravings of a madman... a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings.
27159,"Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name. But they seemed pretty excited about it."
27162,"Hey, cheese brain!"
27165,"Hey, skeever butt!"
27166,"Hey, slug-breath!"
27167,This one doesn't look too difficult.
27169,That should do it. After you.
27170,It'll be good to not have to hear him whining about his debts.
27174,"You keep giving and giving Bersi, and they'll keep taking and taking. When is it going to end?"
27175,The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent.
27177,"Please, someone help me!"
27178,"Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really."
27179,Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor.
27180,I'm sure you have something in mind.
27181,Dragonborn... Perhaps this is the fate of Skyrim after all. To be destroyed from the inside.
27182,As always. The Nords don't ever stop wanting things enchanted.
27183,For a dragon to attack Kynesgrove... Why? Why there? Is no place safe?
27185,I've already said too much.
27188,"Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices. Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior members know."
27189,Looks like we've got ourselves another fool.
27191,There's a whole college up in Solitude where they teach the arts. Song. Lute-playing. Poetry.
27192,"Jonna, do you think the townspeople are warming to my serenades?"
27194,"Got stones in your ears? I asked what side you're on, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born!"
27197,"Hey, watch it!"
27198,"Fine. Let's trade, then."
27200,"A wise and foresighted policy, in the event."
27201,Let me know. We shouldn't stay here all day. My men want their mead.
27202,"The restless dead. Not pretty, but if you don't stop them, they'll move on to the locals."
27203,"Difference is, the Gray-Manes turned their backs on the Empire and we Battle-Borns stayed loyal."
27204,"Meanwhile, my very capable steward sees to the needs of the smallfolk and ensures that my hold runs smoothly."
27208,You don't know what you're dealing with. There will be consequences if you harm that tree. Leave this place - you're not welcome here anymore.
27209,"When Aventus escaped, Grelod was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. But that won't happen ever again."
27210,The goddess's divine blessings have no doubt helped make Whiterun a thriving and prosperous city.
27212,"Oh, thank Arkay. Please, take this gold for your troubles."
27213,Dear. You really ought to put some clothes on. You're embarrassing yourself.
27218,I suppose it would be better than sitting around thinking about all this.
27219,"She hides inside with her 'visions'. We need a leader, not some mystic!"
27222,Keep Mother's staff. Think of it as payment. I want to leave everything from this cursed place behind. Goodbye. And thank you.
27225,"I've been trying to find out why ever since. Gotten nowhere so far, and then I got married. Have a child of my own on the way."
27227,"At the time I couldn't stand to be around anyone. They all felt sorry for me and I didn't want them to. It was my problem, not theirs."
27228,How can Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible. Could he pick his way in?
27232,"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Cave Bear pelts."
27233,"This ain't the Dark Brotherhood. Next time, you keep the job clean and you'll get your coin."
27234,We'll look around Sky Haven Temple and see what else the old Blades might have left for us. It's a better hideout than I could have hoped for.
27237,"We are thieves, you fool. We're stealing the cube."
27239,No...
27240,...
27241,"That's no business of yours, son. Mind you keep your nose out of it."
27244,"Suit yourself. It's only of value to collectors, though. Good luck finding anyone else who will appraise it that highly!"
27251,Jarl Elisif the Fair. Poor woman. Losing her husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all.
27252,"Still, even with the rough treatment we've had at the hands of Ulfric and his lot, I've got ties here."
27254,"You there. If you're here to trade, step up to the counter."
27257,"I'm a Dark Elf and I live in Windhelm, so yes, I live in the Gray Quarter."
27259,"The dark elves are too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are, and so they continue to dwell in that slum."
27261,"It was difficult at first. The Nords of this city are, at best, suspicious of outsiders."
27262,I knew when you walked into the Hall of the Dead that you were special.
27263,"You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella."
27264,"But to invade my home, kidnap my family..."
27267,It's time we had a real king. One of our own making.
27270,Wait... I....
27271,Do not delay. Alduin must feel the tremors in Time by the Scroll's presence here. He will know what it means.
27272,"Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you."
27274,Hroggar's fate is in your hands.
27276,All these younglings scampering around.
27278,Is it dead?
27279,Maybe I should round up some men and take us a few prisoners to interrogate.
27280,"In fact, who are you, anyway?"
27281,I wanted you to have this. A token of my affection. Don't mean we're engaged or nothin'.
27282,Speak to one of the others if you wish to buy something.
27285,"Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth."
27286,I made a split second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death.
27289,Our fires are visible for miles. We're in a low valley. Sitting ducks.
27295,Yep.
27296,You want to give up now? Out of fear? Is that what we're teaching our daughter?
27297,It's a Nordic ruin. Thousands of years old.
27304,"Even right this moment, I feel strange... when I don't think I should be feeling anything at all."
27305,"Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you."
27308,How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!
27309,Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there.
27311,"He likes to get drunk and walk around the Gray Quarter yelling insults at us in the small hours of the morning. A real charmer, that one."
27312,I'll mount your head on my wall!
27313,Looks dead to me.
27315,"Nothing new there. Most of the Nords living in Windhelm don't care much for us, but Rolff is the worst by far."
27320,You will pay for your defiance!
27322,I have feasted on many greater than you.
27324,Did you want something? I'm quite busy.
27325,For the Forsworn!
27326,Maar saraan ko Sovngarde.
27328,My time has come again.
27329,Paarthurnax is weak. I am strong.
27330,"You are no match for me, joor!"
27331,"He needs someone to confide in. If it will not be one of us, perhaps it will be you. Go to him."
27333,"Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this."
27334,May the Divines guide and keep you.
27335,Not right now.
27336,Brave hearts beat lesser ones. That's the decider.
27339,"Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving."
27341,Damn shame to leave that lying around.
27342,"Sir, this is costing lives of both imperial loyalists and Skyrim citizens alike. And it's winning the rebels support where they had none before."
27344,"The Blades have never followed that path, of course."
27346,But Mikael... He sings only for gold and the affections of wenches. He dishonors our traditions.
27347,Is that all?
27348,We Nords have a long history as warrior poets. I am proud to count myself among them.
27349,Man gives bards a bad name.
27351,My tunic is fading. Too much sun and salt spray.
27352,I doubt it can be repaired. You'll have to buy a new one.
27353,Back so soon Xander?
27355,"The guards know who holds the purse strings in this city, and I don't like snoops."
27356,Hmph. Looks like we got a cutthroat skulkin' around...
27357,"Don't fret, my fanged acquaintance. I shan't trouble you a bit."
27360,"Aye. She's helping me in the house, and even helps her father at the forge."
27362,Your job is to do what I say. And I say you have many nails and fittings to make before you even touch a blade. Now get to work.
27363,"Murdered? By Azura, who would do such a thing?"
27364,A...a body! How absolutely terrible.
27369,"Damn it, this will not stand!"
27370,Hsss! Dead. Who did this?
27372,"Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started!"
27373,Right then.
27374,"I'm gonna find you, Elf!"
27375,I'll claw the eyes out of whoever did this!
27377,It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do... as an instrument of limitless wealth.
27380,"Aye, he does indeed... and with his fingers in the East Empire Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt."
27385,Sovngarde take your soul. I'll avenge your body.
27386,Damn. We've got trouble.
27388,Freshly killed. Whoever did this is still close... and will suffer for their insolence.
27389,"Your body lies dead, but your soul has joined our ranks..."
27390,"Kill one of us, and three more will take their place. The Forsworn are unstoppable."
27392,"Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden nearly as much as he should lately."
27394,Gormlaith! We're running out of time! The battle...
27395,That's some good armor you've put together.
27396,"If I die today, it will not be in terror."
27397,"You wear the armor of the bear, my friend. A fine choice."
27401,Grelod... murdered. Here. I... I need... air... You... you... Get out of here! Get out!
27403,"True enough, but there's nothing wrong with a little adventure now and then. Not much excitement in working the soil every day."
27404,"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Whiterun. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
27407,"No, damn you!"
27408,"Look, it's dangerous, but if you sneak the ring into her house. Put in a dresser or something. I will make it worth your while."
27412,I've been hearing stories about dragons. That they're back. That they can eat the sun out of the sky and freeze a man where he stands.
27415,Meyye! Tahrodiis aanne! Him hinde pah liiv! Zu'u hin daan!
27416,Stop by my stall in the market sometime.
27417,Faal Kel...?! Nikriinne...
27419,I suppose that's yours now.
27420,*gasp*
27421,Not sure I understand the question. The Legion's always been in Skyrim. 
27422,We could always look for another brand.
27423,"How may I help you, my son?"
27426,It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur.
27427,"Oh, didn't you know?"
27428,"The College will continue to research these intriguing objects, and of course any findings will be relayed with all possible haste."
27431,"The Arcanaeum is located above the hall, and the Arch-Mage's quarters above that."
27432,"Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman."
27435,The Augur was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend.
27436,"Come, we will do your next test inside the hall."
27437,"A gift, Dovahkiin. Shul. Understand Sun as the dov do."
27439,"We are poised for glory, Jod. The Empire will never take Dawnstar while every last man, woman, and child here draws breathe!"
27441,"So, what's the latest exciting news about goings-on in Winterhold?"
27444,Yeah.
27445,Imperial spies? You can't be serious!
27446,Can't sleep well no matter how much drink I put in me.
27450,See you.
27451,"Captain Lonely-Gale has been avoiding me, I just know it."
27454,"Hey, could you deliver this bottle of Nightshade Extract to Wuunferth?"
27456,So why'd you join up with the Legion?
27458,"I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, Wuunferth, pays us to plant a little Nightshade. Who knows what he uses it for?"
27459,That's how I slipped in there. Should still be unguarded.
27460,Everything you see is grown at my family's own Hollyfrost Farm. Fresh and filling.
27461,Thanks.
27462,Fresh Fish! Straight from the Fjords!
27466,Very well.
27469,Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
27470,"Dragons, now, is it? Please, mother. If you keep on like this everyone in town will think you're crazy."
27471,I'm a lot happier out here on the deck than I am wandering around in that ruin of a city.
27475,"He's not spying, but it's clear the Empire is making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them."
27476,"Ah yes, the extract, good. Poisonous, of course, but it has its uses."
27479,"Was it Molag? No, no... Little Tim, the toymaker's son? The ghost of King Lysandus? Or was it... Yes! Stanley, that talking grapefruit from Passwall."
27481,You've done it! You've beaten him!
27482,And yet...
27484,"After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?"
27485,"Stand away from me, or I'll crack you like an egg."
27486,He's no longer abusing the power of the Eye. I would've expected all this to stop.
27489,Well? Where the hell are those damned Stormcloaks? Let's get this over with already.
27491,"Stay out of trouble, Nord."
27492,Who are you?
27493,These Forsworn are just savages. They live in caves and ruins when civilized folk build towns and cities.
27494,Captain. What should we do? He's not on the list.
27496,"Got nothing to spare for travelers nor refugees, here."
27497,Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here she is. Now what is it that you want?
27499,"Follow the Captain, prisoner."
27500,Forget the list. He goes to the block.
27502,Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero. But a hero doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne.
27505,"As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the Eight Divines upon you, for you are the salt and earth of Nirn, our beloved...."
27506,"Yeah, but you're into gold. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm not going anywhere."
27507,Go tell the commander. I'm sure the boot in your arse will take your mind off your troubles.
27508,"No harm shall come to me, for I live under Azura's wisdom. Her foresight protects me. Her insight sustains me."
27509,"Next, the Nord in the rags!"
27510,"I mean, I knew the Dark Brotherhood was good... just not that good! You killed the old hag before I even asked!"
27511,"We're quartered in the Hall of the Vigilant. Keeper Carcette heads Skyrim's branch of our order there, providing healing and justice as needed."
27513,So be it.
27515,"I'm watching you, Grelka. One slip up and I report you to the guards. You got that?"
27518,"Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years ago."
27520,And I told you I'd pay it when I'm good and ready.
27522,I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus's remains to lay to rest.
27523,"New to Skyrim? I was confused at first, too. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead."
27526,"You look new. I'm new, too. I think we could be friends."
27528,"No. However, I know someone who might."
27529,I'm a bard by trade. Perhaps you've heard of me?
27530,Glory to Namira!
27532,"By the gods, my ears..."
27533,Maybe a hardy Nord like you doesn't need a cure-all. Hmm? What about an invisibility potion?
27537,"Treat the Jarl with respect, and you'll be welcome here."
27538,I guess you're right. A Nord shouldn't be so proud to turn down a kind soul's generosity. Tell Iddra I'll be fine.
27540,Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased.
27541,She's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
27542,I'm sorry to hear that. I thought your eyes had finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
27543,"Oh, yes. Weylin. Bastard could have at least gone crazy after we made our silver quota."
27544,Good morning.
27546,"Fine. You sound like a priest of Mara, but I get your point. Tell him to forget about the gold."
27547,"Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives if necessary."
27549,"This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but always too clever for his own good."
27552,We've got to ground that bastard!
27553,"Oh, really? Well then... how can I make that happen?"
27556,I'm in charge of the smelter. Not you. So why don't you lay off?
27557,"All right, all right. You sound like a damn Legion officer, but I get it. I'll give him a break. This better not hurt our quota."
27558,They don't work now. Why should I waste more money?
27560,Wasn't surprising he stayed loyal to the Empire. His father helped capture Ulfric Stormcloak after the Markarth Incident.
27561,Are you a sellsword? I don't like your kind. No honor. No loyalty. Unreliable.
27562,I'll be right here if you need anything else.
27563,Talos keep you.
27565,There hasn't been a true High King in Skyrim for generations.
27566,Figures. You elders are always so boring.
27569,Make sure that he is.
27570,"On my honor, I won't bother Carlotta ever again."
27571,"Here, a reward from your Jarl."
27572,"Beitild thinks I drink on the job. Well, what does it matter if I do? Huh?"
27573,"While you're out hunting, keep a sharp eye open for any dragon scales and bones you might find. I'd be interested in looking at them."
27574,"And you helped me! You helped poor Cicero! You talked to Loreius, got him to fix my wheel!"
27576,You are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can say.
27578,"I don't fight Lars no more, if that's what you're worried about."
27579,"No doubt she's convinced you that she's the victim. But, do you know why we pursue her?"
27580,Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
27581,"For Ulfric? Oh, nothing official. Known him for years."
27582,The finest jewelry in all of Markarth.
27583,I said get down there. Now.
27585,"Deliver the message to the warring parties. If they will listen, I will do what I can to bring them to terms."
27586,You got it?
27587,"If Moon Sugar is refined properly, it can be used to make skooma, another substance that will knock you over after a single draught."
27588,That's not going to work.
27589,"I'd recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there you can take a carriage to Solitude."
27592,"We're not mining up any ore with those undead around, so I wouldn't go down there if I were you."
27594,"You won't. The Jarl has ordered a life sentence for you. Get comfortable in the dark, 'cause you'll never see the sun again."
27595,"Still, I fear there is some connection."
27596,Good.
27598,I've never known Avulstein to be that convincing! Where is the little scamp?
27599,"Don't get smart with me. I'm in charge. You keep it up, I'll have your toes cut off."
27600,"I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on."
27601,"Yes, master, I know. I just want to keep up my own projects as well."
27602,"You wouldn't know it now, but the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns were once fast friends."
27604,"In any case, if I can't get past the creatures in that room, I can't recover the treasure. I need more manpower."
27605,All right. Open her up.
27607,"Hey, when you make up your mind, just let me know. I'll be here."
27609,"So unless you're here to dig, you don't belong here."
27610,"Yeah, I know what you mean. If things don't start getting better soon, I may look for work elsewhere."
27611,And I... I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure to protect the Key.
27613,"No more talk of Shel. As chief, I will do what I please, so point your fiery gaze to our enemies."
27614,"They're as useless as a fifth wheel on a wagon. Gave me some sort of a line about ""keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers."""
27616,I like to bring Grimvar down here sometimes. It reminds him how lucky he is.
27617,We're not. The Silver-Bloods pay our wage. Every man here is a trained mercenary.
27620,Must have been nothing.
27622,"It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there's is a difference! Stupid cow."
27625,"Everyone, on me! The Jarl wishes to speak!"
27626,Gadba and me came to work the mine. The plan is to get rich and then go back to Largashbur and take over!
27628,"Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor! "
27629,"In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts."
27631,"I get you, and the Dark Brotherhood gets to continue its existence."
27632,The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt!
27633,"I simply locked the doors, hid beneath my counter and prayed to the Divines that my life would be spared and my shop wouldn't burn to the ground."
27634,"But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire."
27637,Grace of Kynareth be with you.
27638,...You! Why?
27641,I bet my uncle Ralof is tougher than you are.
27643,I wonder how many of us think we'll be the lucky ones and survive this?
27645,And to think that we've been supplying the Greybeards with our own food supplies. What have they ever done for us?
27646,You're making me... nervous. Is there something you need?
27647,"Oh, but the Listener jests with poor Cicero. You already have company. You don't need my help at all."
27652,"Well met, traveler. What brings you to Whiterun?"
27654,You're right. I'll have to remember that the next time I get a shipment in.
27655,You need only ask about. Plenty o' folk in Whiterun with too much fat and gold to be bothered doing anything for themselves.
27656,"Now, you can go back to your College and leave me be, or I can kill you. Your choice."
27657,"I may have roots in Cyrodiil, but Skyrim's as much my home as any Nord's."
27659,"Ah, so it's gold you're after, then? "
27663,We left Sirgar in charge back at Stonehills. I hope that wasn't a mistake.
27665,Thank the gods for the end of yet another pointless conversation...
27666,Truly?
27668,"By the gods, it's true, isn't it? A dragon has attacked Whiterun. How could mere men bring down such a beast?"
27672,"In fact, I'm glad you're here. There's something I'd like to ask you."
27673,A pity. And words I hear too often.
27674,Heard of them? I've been captaining a crew for 'em well on nine years now. What's it to you?
27676,"I'm quite aware of what's going on here, and I will not stand for it!"
27677,Careful!
27678,"They're sayin' dragons have returned to Skyrim. Now that there, that's a real problem."
27681,I'll rest easy when we've driven every last Imperial pig back across the Jerall Mountains!
27685,I have spent my entire life searching for it. 
27694,"Ha! The most important question of all, that one."
27699,"You'll want the Bannered Mare. See old Hulda, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead."
27701,"But mind he bard, Mikael. Poncy little milk drinker, that one."
27703,Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands!
27704,"Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you!"
27705,"He was a wonderful man, and he loved us very much. I'm sorry I yelled at you."
27706,It'd be my honor should you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll make the necessary arrangements.
27707,"Look. Something is happening here. I'm not sure entirely what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out."
27708,Thank you for your role in all of this. 
27709,Always thought that old mine had more to it. Just like Mauhulakh to smash his way to good fortune.
27712,"Oh, I know."
27714,I understand.
27715,"I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception."
27717,Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named Aringoth.
27718,Of course you want to invest in my business. I'm the finest blacksmith in all Skyrim.
27719,None escape the Vigil. All come into the light.
27722,"Aye, now that there's a beautiful sword. Like a sliver of midnight."
27723,"Is there something you need, dear?"
27724,"By doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal and in essence, caused our luck to run dry."
27726,Stendarr be with you.
27727,"The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.  "
27729,The suffering the Daedra cause will not go unpunished.
27730,I beg your pardon?
27732,"Only bit I could make out was ""repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,"" and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there."
27733,"Wherever the Daedra hide, the Vigil of Stendarr will cast them into the light."
27734,Right. You adventuring types would never go into a room just to steal everything.
27736,Leave me alone. I just want to find my way out of this accursed province.
27739,"I don't think so. Sorry. I would love to help you, but Elenwen can be very vindictive. I wouldn't want to get on her bad side."
27741,"We bring his compassion where none can be found, by cleansing all those who would offend his children."
27743,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
27745,"You weren't nearly as successful as you think, fool. According to my scrying the Wolf Queen has returned."
27746,"That, and I made my fortune by knowing when to spend my septims, and when not to. I can't stand waste."
27747,Oh? I don't expect anyone to miss my meaning.
27751,Why don't you swallow that stubborn pride of yours and ask Eorlund Gray-Mane for help?
27752,That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood... the telltale sign of a practiced thief.
27753,I bet my papa could beat you up.
27755,"Magic is seen as something for elves, and weaker races."
27757,You're as good as dead!
27759,Good work. The mindless cretins didn't stand a chance.
27761,Thank the Divines we survived that.
27762,I'm here! I knew I'd find you!
27763,Egh!
27764,"Before the meadery was opened almost fifty years ago, this town was nothing... a simple waypoint for those journeying on to Morrowind."
27765,"You there, Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting."
27766,"Do not forsake your heart, child, for it may one day come to surprise you."
27770,"Always, child. Mara's mercy is ever-flowing."
27771,"Are you prepared, then, to help bring the light across this land?"
27772,I don't want to choose! They're both so amazing.
27774,"But she is as volatile as a sabre cat. One wrong word, and I've seen her turn on a man so quickly..."
27778,"A monster? No. I'm just a servant. To my king, Madanach."
27779,Lead on.
27781,Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round!
27782,"Oh... yes... um... thank you. Here you go. Some gold for your assistance and your, discretion."
27784,"Do you think those dark elves had anything to do with the murders? The attacks all happened at night, after all."
27785,Calcelmo? What about him?
27787,I'm impressed at your even-handed treatment. Thank you.
27789,Don't talk such rot.
27792,"I should very much like to see you try it, my dear steward."
27793,"Ah, the one generous soul amongst a gathering of pinch-pennies and lick-spittles!"
27794,My friend died. Things won't be the same without him.
27796,"That armor you got rid of. I can have it, yeah?"
27797,Seems friendly enough. Obviously intelligent. Why do you ask?
27798,Brit grah. I had forgotten what fine sport you mortals can provide!
27799,Think of him? He's an odd little man. Always poking around the ruins and wasting time in his museum.
27803,"Astrid... By the sands, I still can't wrap my head around it..."
27804,"I need at least five more, if you can find them."
27805,"Everyone who's anyone. Viarmo bought an apple the other day, said he was looking for a new student."
27806,"Please, stop wasting my time. You're embarrassing yourself."
27808,Of course you were. Now stop wasting my time.
27810,"And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me again."
27811,I don't like talking to someone who holds their honor so cheaply.
27812,"We are devoted to the Goddess Mara, who gave mortals the gift of love that they might have a hint of eternity."
27814,"As you can imagine, I tend to forget things often. Leave things around. I really must learn to put these things away."
27816,"You've come for me, have you?"
27817,"I suppose you're free to frolic with the wenches in the servant's quarters, but anywhere else, you must have an escort. Jarl's orders."
27818,I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon.
27820,"Ooh... This place really chills the blood, eh?"
27821,Well aren't you a strange one.
27822,"We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller."
27824,"Whoa, lass. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?"
27825,So we take matters into our own hands.
27827,My mind weighs heavy enough. Leave me to my food.
27828,Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
27829,"My father was rarely home, so it was my mother who actually taught me how to use a bow."
27830,"Well, that and maybe those stuck-up, dung-sniffing Battle-Borns."
27831,"And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette. "
27834,"If you can remain calm, even in the midst of chaos, your arrow will most likely find its target."
27837,Aim for the middle target.
27838,"OK, let's see what you can do."
27840,Here you go.
27842,It's easy - stay inside the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
27843,"Even when you get to the last sip in your flagon, it'll taste just as good as the first!"
27845,Why aren't you at Honningbrew Meadery?
27847,Need something for a potion? You're certainly in the right place.
27848,My older brother took me out hunting a lot when I was little.
27850,I did that engraved piece just last month!
27852,"Do you have some reason to be here, citizen?"
27854,"Hmmm... You can go, but you stay on your best behavior now."
27855,We barely have enough for ourselves...
27857,You are due more honor than some calls and feasting.
27858,"Justice demands that he die for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort."
27859,"When I tell you to, try and hit each of the three closest targets in eight seconds."
27860,I'll see you at the watchtower as soon as the rest of the men have gathered.
27862,"I'll count to three and then say ""go."" You have eight seconds to hit each of the three targets. Draw string and get ready."
27864,"Here, take these. Looks like you're running low."
27866,"I always had a feeling she liked me. More than that brute Jofthor, at least."
27867,Great shot. Now hit the target to the right.
27869,"Please, let's speak privately."
27870,Shoot the left target.
27871,Shoot the right target.
27872,Shoot the middle target.
27875,"What glorious prey. Come back alive, and with stories to tell!"
27880,"I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
27882,Kind of scary if I think about it.
27884,"There are those now who wish for a similar change. I am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say."
27886,"When I found this, I immediately thought of you. Here. A small token of my gratitude."
27887,We're going to slaughter them. All of them.
27890,"Need something? Unlike the rest of my family, I've got work to do. "
27893,"Got plenty, take your pick."
27895,So have you ever actually spoken to Captain Lonely-Gale?
27896,That is a lot of blood.
27897,"Quickly, we have no time to lose."
27898,"I know it isn't much, but here, take this bow. It was given to me by my family. It's special to me, but brings back too many painful memories."
27901,"If you turn around, you'll notice my guests. I've ""collected"" them from... well, that's not really important. The here and now. That's what matters."
27902,I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's all you need to know.
27903,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
27904,Thanks for sticking around and keeping me company.
27905,A few bad apples spoil the bunch. You know how it is.
27908,Noooo....
27909,"It'll be Skyrim that leads the charge. Mark my words. And that time around, mankind will either succeed once and for all or die trying."
27911,And a Nord knows a liar when she sees one.
27912,"Hands to yourself, sneak thief."
27913,"It's good we hold the Reach. Were the rebels to gain control, the silver mines would give them coin to hire more thugs and expand their violence."
27915,Head up the steps from the market an' look to your right. Can't miss it.
27917,"I admit, the dragons are a concern, but we can avoid them if we do not stay in one place for too long."
27918,"Crazy person... Something must be wrong with its head, to strut around like that."
27919,It pains me to see that the whispers had truth to them. 
27922,Gray-Mane. Now that's a name fills you with pride. We've got roots in Whiterun. We've got history.
27924,"They put on airs like they're somethin' special. Sure, they've got money, but they ain't got a shred of honor between 'em."
27926,Don't even get me started on that lot.
27927,"Just remember that you're only a part of my court, this doesn't make you one of the family."
27932, 
27936,"Well, would you look at that! Argonian Ale! My thanks, friend. Here, take this here healing potion. I, er, ""found"" it in the temple. "
27937,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
27939,Begone from here! Get out of this orphanage! Help!Somebody help me!
27940,The Order shall rise.
27942,Just... leave here! Leave us alone!
27945,"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Riften. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
27948,Thank you.
27949,"In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Markarth. Talk to my steward if you're interested."
27950,"What is your need, Dragonborn?"
27951,"I knew it... Mercer sent you to kill me! Guards, there's an intruder!"
27953,"Come on, hurry up."
27954,Thanks.
27955,The best tales are those of adventure. Who could truly write such a tale without first experiencing such?
27957,"Hemming, I need you to bring a note to Sibbi. I need him to do something for me."
27959,You're referring to that blacksmith contract?
27960,Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.
27961,"But if you're willing to work, and you prove to be reliable, I might deem you worthy to live here. My steward will handle things from there."
27962,There's something you could do for me. For all of us here.
27963,"By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again."
27964,"They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts."
27965,Look... You shouldn't be doing that...
27967,Used to be a lucrative underworld commodity when Balmora was still standing. Now the stuff is beyond valuable.
27968,The damned nightmares have finally stopped. Don't suppose you'd know anything about that?
27969,"Well, I suppose I could use a hand with something, yes."
27970,"Shatter-Shield, East Empire Company... we'll work for any ship that pulls in, as long as they can pay."
27971,But not my own!
27973,(sigh)
27974,Alduin mahlaan
27975,"If you're looking to hire the strongest mercenary in Skyrim, I'd wager your search is over."
27977,Let's talk inside.
27980,"The city's ruled by the Jarl up in Dragonsreach. That's the fortress, there, up on the tall hill."
27985,"I've never seen anything like this, in all my years."
27986,"I think given time, you'll understand what I mean."
27988,So nice to get this break from my cleaning duties.
27989,Now ain't this a surprise.
27990,"The cousin of the Emperor was murdered! In Solitude, at her own damn wedding. Not a chance we would have let that happen here."
27991,It speaks truthfully.
27992,"I'd say we're prosperous enough. Most folk don't go hungry, if they're willing to work hard."
27993,"To kill triplets, secretly, and then have the whole thing blamed on the mother. Remarkable."
27995,I'd like to know why there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here in the College.
27996,"Hmph. No, friend, that I'm not. But I get along with your kind well enough."
27997,It's got to be tough. Skyrim's a hard enough land when you've got a roof over your head.
27998,"Yeah, these Khajiit make a living traveling the roads and selling their wares."
27999,"Good, good."
28000,"Way I hear it, Elsweyr ain't nothing like Skyrim. It's got tropical forests and dusty badlands. It sounds awful!"
28001,"Heart of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Forsworn..."
28002,Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.
28003,I have just the place. The owner likes to stash some lovely trinkets in his strongbox like this beauty. Can you get it for us?
28006,"""Too hot-headed,"" they cried. Weak, pathetic cowards, the lot of them!"
28007,You been talking to those Companions?
28008,Be patient and your time will come.
28009,I guess they thought a woman wasn't strong enough to hurt him. I didn't mean for him to die! Why would I want that? I just... lost control.
28011,"They wanted me to prove my worth, so they threw me up against a young whelp of a lad, hardly old enough to grow his first chin-hairs."
28012,It wasn't my fault! I told them over and over that it was an accident!
28015,"After all, where is the value in creating art if there is nobody left alive to see it?"
28017,"I've been sent by Silver-Bloods to keep this mine ""safe."""
28019,Did you see that candle above the fire upstairs?
28021,I should say so. I'd be careful in the future before you confront someone without all of the facts!
28025,"Bothela, I have a question...."
28027,Try and hit the left target.
28030,"But... I can't help but notice that you're doing quite well for yourself, rising through the ranks and all."
28035,"Shor's bones, what happened to you, boy?"
28036,I've been tending to the warriors of Jorrvaskr for as long as I can remember.
28037,"People won't say it, but they're afraid of me, so they leave me alone."
28038,"Looking to practice, stranger?"
28039,No! I'm losing the binding.
28040,Shoot the far target.
28042,The metal has been stubborn today. It refuses to bend.
28043,"So, it's to the pain then!"
28046,"Remember, composure and speed. You don't need to see your arrow hit before moving onto your next target. Trust your shot is true."
28047,Talos preserve you.
28048,"Come on, hurry up."
28049,"Yes, I was hired to protect the others as we walk the roads of Skyrim."
28052,Watch your hands around the Legate.
28053,"Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those..."
28054,"One, two, three..."
28055,You should think harder on your oath to the Emperor next time you're deciding what's right.
28057,What was that?
28060,I won't let you hurt Alva!
28061,Don't be like them. Don't feel sorry for me.
28062,Don't you see? I was like a daughter to Tova. A sister to Nilsine and Friga. But the family refuses to believe my innocence. No matter what I say.
28064,Stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
28065,Only use the practice arrows.
28068,"Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, sister."
28069,"After all that it's been through, the College still stands. In no small part thanks to you!"
28071,You need to stay inside the boundaries.
28073,Now hit it again.
28074,"Anton sure looks like he's from the Reach, but don't tell him that."
28075,"Stop by again, sometime. I'll sing for you."
28078,"You should see me when you get bored, stranger."
28079,You chose the wrong girl to mess with.
28080,"Thank you, dear friend. You've given me back my son."
28082,"Well, let me know if you ever want to practice."
28084,Of course you will.
28085,Cease fighting. It's over.
28086,Curse you!
28088,We come to this moment carried by the sacrifices and courage of our fellows. Those who have fallen. And those still bearing the shields to our right.
28089,I'm Skald's housecarl and head of his guard in Dawnstar.
28091,It's over. No more violence.
28092,"I do not fear you, Dovahkiin!"
28093,"Come and face me, then!"
28094,Your Voice is strong... for a mortal.
28095,We'll show those faithless dogs who this land belongs to.
28096,No funny business. I'm watching you.
28097,Hiding will not save you!
28098,"Please, come with me. I need to speak to you privately."
28100,My lord Alduin requires your death. I am glad to oblige him.
28101,I'm glad we agree on this.
28102,"It's to be a real fight, then. Good!"
28103,I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!
28104,"Before I could even draw my blade, her second arrow found its mark in my chest."
28105,"I said I'm fine, Madena. I won't have some court mage fixing me up like some magical experiment."
28106,"And that's on top of noises from the marsh in the night, tales of monsters, and now this wizard in our midst."
28107,They should have drawn it out some more. He deserved a slower death.
28109,Did you want something?
28110,Such a shame.
28111,Od...
28112,You dare bring me here? You must be punished.
28113,"I... I'm sorry I... I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very... stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?"
28114,"If you could call it that. The Jarl can make all the demands in the world, I'm not setting one foot on the battlefield."
28116,Attack while it's landed!
28119,"I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up."
28120,Come on! This is our best chance!
28122,You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!
28123,We've got to ground that bastard!
28124,Thanks again for finding out about my daughter.
28125,Real Nords like to prove their mettle in the pit.
28126,"I said ""a free meat pie"". As in one. Here's yours."
28127,"You tell anyone that I told you, and I'll fry you from the inside out. Got it? Good."
28128,We've got to bring it down!
28129,Get over to Riften.
28132,We can't afford to lose any men if we wish to keep Falkreath protected.
28134,"What are you, some kind of tease? Stendarr's Mercy...."
28135,"The last thing you need is my help. Listener or not, you've proven yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family... and to me."
28136,We should get moving. There's no time to waste.
28137,Now you're mine!
28138,Bring Verulus here. The Lady of Decay will do the rest.
28139,Good. Good. Now we won't have to spend time searching for it.
28140,Even its name is an echo. 
28143,"""You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it."""
28145,"He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place."
28146,Your death brings me honor!
28147,I can't wait around for you to make up your mind. I'll meet you at Kynesgrove. Don't waste time getting there.
28149,"Ours is to smile at your passing, friend."
28150,Why didn't you say so earlier? At least now we don't have to waste time searching the area.
28151,"Yeah, sure, okay."
28152,"Captain Aldis can't prove it, but that Argonian is up to no good."
28156,They mean to take our history and crush it all in the name of some damn treaty.
28157,"Oh, did you need something?"
28158,It was good speaking with you again.
28161,"For now, just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot."
28162,"Not now, please."
28166,"Can I make something now, papa?"
28169,Riften is drowning in a sea of sin and wickedness and it's my personal mission to let everyone know that the warmth of Mara can see them through.
28171,"If you require assistance with summoning techniques, please let me know."
28172,"That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that dragon's power?"
28173,"Calcelmo. He's the Jarl's magical advisor, but he spends most of his time studying the ruins."
28174,"Balgruuf, did you slip out again last night for a drink at the Bannered Mare?"
28175,"Our little girl died recently. I've been shouldering my days with strong mead, but nothing gives my Tova peace."
28177,"See that disgusting drunk over there? A high-ranking official in the East Empire Company, believe it or not."
28180,"Ever seen a book called ""The Mirror""? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work."
28184,Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking.
28185,"But I hear the maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they can help for such an important matter?"
28186,That I am. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing.
28187,Caves sounded more exciting in the bard's songs.
28188,Right. Happy trails.
28189,"Well, I'll want to meet them next time they're around. Maybe you can give an introduction."
28193,I picked up the trade when I was a girl. One of the temple healers staying here on a pilgrimage showed me the basics.
28195,"Before my ma and da passed, I told them that one day, I'd become the best trader in Skyrim."
28197,"With respect, Companion, I'd ask that you and your friends muzzle that dog of yours. The howling coming from Jorrvaskr has gotten out of hand."
28199,"How about drink? None of that local piss. Real Black-Briar Mead, fresh from Riften."
28200,"Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay."
28201,Work? I demand tribute before you can be considered for any real tasks.
28202,"Well, good. They're gone."
28205,"And perhaps... well, I don't wish to speculate, but... What if we could contact the dwarves? What if they're still out there? Imagine!"
28211,My wife Seren and I run it together. She still smiths even though we found out she is with child.
28212,"So getting the guards to throw me in here as a ""punishment"" was about as easy as falling off a log."
28214,You might do well to learn a smaller weapon. Vary your style a bit.
28216,Bottles of Moon Sugar. Khajiit use it as a... pick me up. Good way to pass the time.
28217,Didn't know her. Guards dragged her body away. Last we'll hear of that.
28220,Now I've been told that the attacker claimed to be a Forsworn. It's nonsense. More likely he was just sick in the head. 
28221,Ice-Veins.
28223,"You'd do that? If you find one, I could teach you a thing or two about trading. Help you get a fair bargain in the future."
28224,You better. I hate people who waste my time.
28225,"Well, I... I simply thought you might wish to help out one of your fellow mages."
28226,The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands of years.
28227,"Is your armor made of... dragon scales? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that."
28229,Look out!
28231,I did not ask for that! No more magic.
28232,What exactly did this amulet look like?
28233,"Never thought I'd get married under a Nord god. But with you, it feels right."
28235,"By Nocturnal's grace, I will defeat you!"
28236,Follow me.
28237,Be glad you're not training under me with that mouth of yours.
28241,"Like others before you, you blindly follow a path to your own destruction."
28242,"That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know."
28243,I suppose it is.
28246,A sharp mind on you. We should find out for ourselves.
28247,Step lightly. Who knows if those things can hear us or not.
28249,"Yeah, you need something?"
28250,Come back whenever you need something.
28253,Do you need alchemy components? Or training?
28254,Gods... Everyone get back!
28255,"Got all your gold ready, boss. You can count every coin, it's all there."
28258,She said you threw her into a goat pen yesterday.
28260,"New in town, right? If you need a place to sleep, head over to the Winking Skeever. We keep a fine inn."
28261,I'm sure you're right.
28266,"Meet me outside Fallowstone Cave. You clear the way to the giant for me, and I'll make sure you get paid for it."
28268,"Don't know what the Redguards see in books, but this will make my Seren happy."
28269, 
28271,It's amazing how much you can learn from a book.
28273,"If you don't mind me saying, Leigelf. You're working too hard. Go home."
28275,"Good. I'll see if I can get some copies made for the men. Here, something for your trouble. The Legion thanks you."
28277,"Ah, a test subject! Go, my pets! Attack!"
28279,"Something simple, a stew perhaps."
28280,You are? Very good.... may I see it?
28281,"Hrongar became the Jarl when his brother Balgruuf, who had the job before him, was murdered."
28283,We're counting on you to make this all worthwhile.
28284,"I get lost sometimes. I'm not sure where I go, but I'm not... I'm not here."
28289,He must be here somewhere...
28294,So be it. The Empire at least puts the greater good above our own interests.
28295,"Quickly, what did you want?"
28296,Twenty coins? No one has that much.
28297,"Owes me a lot of coin for drinks. I keep telling him not to worry about it, but he's got the stubborn Nord blood."
28298,Too slow!
28300,"Sure, but I bet he can't hold his mead as well as me!"
28301,New in town? You're lucky. Dreams aren't affecting travelers.
28305,"I've got no interest in magic users. No use for their kind at all. They're way up north in Winterhold, and that's fine with me."
28307,He doesn't deserve to speak!
28308,"The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with."
28309,He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us.
28310,I've got my eye on you.
28311,I work for the Windpeak Inn. You should head on inside.
28313,Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. I wish someone would beat the coin out of his fat fists. He clings to every Septim.
28314,"That bard Mikael is begging for a dagger up against his throat, the way he goes on about me."
28320,"I know there's ore still in there, I can smell it. If you think you're right then you can pack up and leave any time you like."
28321,"Sure is. I've got another client -- wants me to do some enchanting. You can do the pick-up for me, if you want."
28323,"Tell me, outsider. Can you banish spirits? For that is what I need."
28327,"Yes, your head hurts and you don't remember where you are."
28328,Slen Tiid Vo!
28329,The Gourmet. Leave it to Titus to spare no expense.
28332,Most impressive.
28333,"Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!"
28334,"Clanfolk, stop the outlander!"
28335,Nords don't care much for magic. The College in Winterhold is about the only place it's not looked down on.
28336,"If you could convince him that I don't care about his tab, it'd certainly make me feel better."
28337,Thanks a lot. Here - a little something for your trouble.
28338,You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it.
28341,"How are you feeling, Vex?"
28342,"Fair? This is war, soldier. War's about winning, not being fair to the enemy."
28343,Hear that?
28345,I trained in Hammerfell during my journeyman years. Redguard smiths are second to none.
28346,Get over to our camp in the Pale. It's time we bring them back into the fold.
28347,I can take care of myself. A Whiterun woman learns how to handle a few idiot men early in life.
28351,The rebels are keeping some of our men prisoner there. I aim to turn that into an advantage.
28352,I'm sure. I'm sure.
28354,"I suppose you'd better hope you can, if you want the information."
28355,The Warrens isn't a place for your type. What do you want?
28357,"Have a house with a good bit of valuables inside, but one particular item's caught my eye. You up for it?"
28360,"It is up to each of us to present ourselves publicly as maturely as possible, and to remain above petty local squabbles."
28361,"If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the Listener... your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to fear your power."
28362,"What do you think I am, a beggar? My family has always paid back every single coin we owed, going back to Tiber Septim's time."
28364,This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants.
28365,I'm sorry. I just don't feel up to entertaining anyone just now.
28366,"I guess if you're telling me to stop worrying about it, maybe I should just let it go. Thank you, friend."
28367,What was that?
28369,What? Are you telling me how to treat my workers? Do you have any idea how much metal the Silver-Blood family wants us to smelt?
28372,"He's off fighting, Adara, with the Stormcloaks. He'll return when the war is over."
28376,"Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers."
28377,"Well, my friend, if you think those boots needs more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them."
28378,I have. One of the old Akaviri records names a dragon living nearby. Shall we send the Blades to help you?
28381,I remember my first feast. I envy you.
28382,Anything for my favorite lass.
28383,Better down here than out there.
28384,Kematu always says we're supposed to be the best of the best. I wasn't.
28386,You know who I am? You attacked one of my clan. I've come to accept your apology... or your death.
28387,"All right, anythin' in particular strike your fancy?"
28390,"I was hoping you would to take something of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos."
28393,"Suppose not. But what's taking the others so long? The sooner we get out of here, the better. Smoke's getting bad. This place'll be raging soon."
28394,"Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an announcement to make!"
28395,"Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like you. Hmph. No, definitely not like you."
28396,I won't say no to that.
28397,"Come in, come in! Make yourself at home!"
28398,No... I was trying to...
28399,I'm getting bored.
28400,"Until then, we have quite the task ahead."
28404,"Tell me, husband. Is it true what I've heard?"
28409,You look like someone who appreciates nice things.
28414,Don't think so.
28418,Ralof! What are you doing here? Ah... I'll be right down.
28421,He's probably hoping I'll refuse so he can blame the Empire for being unreasonable. I think I'll have to disappoint him yet again.
28425,"Suit yourself, then. The woods are that way. Outside the walls, walk straight ahead. Can't miss them. Good luck on your hunt."
28428,Ragnar has a strong arm. Pity he isn't an Orc.
28429,"Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul. Good. I was getting... hungry."
28433,"By Ysmir's beard, I ain't one for humor. You know who the Companions are. So quit your asking."
28434,"Bribing me? Well, a bard does need to eat. On my ancestor's honor, I won't trouble sweet Carlotta again."
28437,"Calm down there, friend. I'll pay! Tell Haran that she'll have her gold."
28439,"On moonlit nights or in darkened rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible."
28440,Not this again...
28443,"The townsfolk call me ""captain"" because I used to be a sailor."
28445,That sapling you recovered means the Gildergreen will live again. Your deed honors the people of Whiterun.
28446,"You want to get back into our graces, you need to talk to Vex. She'll set you straight."
28448,"Mind your tricks, wizard. No need for someone to get hurt..."
28449,"Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more!"
28450,"After Whiterun is retaken, Ulfric will pay in blood for his insolence."
28451,"Alchemy is simple. Unless, of course, you are simple. Then I can't help you."
28452,Think you can mess with an Orc of the Reach? Let's go.
28455,See if you can find anything in the burned out house.
28462,"Easy. Maybe I was being too harsh on them. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, they will be paid fairly. You have my word."
28465,"Whoa. Hey there. I didn't mean to make you upset. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me again."
28466,Idiot.
28468,"Aela said that the cleansing used a head from one of the witches of Glenmoril, yes?"
28469,Already have.
28470,You looking for something?
28471,"Have no idea what my birth name really is, and I frankly don't care."
28472,"Wasn't your business, anyway."
28479,I have a couple of Ranmir's things that he traded to us back when he was still paying regularly. I say you've earned them.
28481,"I need but a moment of your time, my lord."
28484,Roggi pawned a few of his things back when he still had things to pawn. Take them.
28485,"Hjorunn, the last time you tried anything, your fist broke on my head!"
28486,Strangers are always trouble.
28488,"You've done a fine thing for me. You know, I used to be quite a warrior in my day. Let me show you a thing or two."
28489,"I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us. Here. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin."
28492,Loose ends and all that.
28495,I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me.
28497,Let's hear it for our kind benefactor!
28500,"This changes everything, of course. There's no time to lose. We must locate...  let me show you. I know I had it here, somewhere..."
28501,"So we fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we were more than a match for them. We were wrong."
28502,You talked Torbjorn down? I'm impressed.
28505,"I'd thank the gods, but I'll settle for thanking you. Here's some coin for your help."
28507,Ulfric would expunge from Skyrim citizens whose only crime was to be born of a non-Nordic woman. That is unacceptable to free men everywhere.
28510,Now. Enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.
28512,This is a good hiding spot.
28513,"Yes, yes. Now to find myself a drink."
28514,Have you reconsidered my idea?
28515,"What? Why, are you... interested?"
28519,Don't think I can take you? One hundred septims says I can punch you back where you came from.
28520,Don't like it? Too bad. This is our city. Ours!
28522,Have you not heard that ancient verse?
28524,A hundred gold says I knock your hide to the ground.
28525,"And why not? I could beat anyone in this city, bare-handed."
28529,"A hundred septims says I can take ya, bare-handed."
28530,"I'm drunk, and it's been a while since I had a good fight."
28531,Go away.
28535,Best luck I've had all day.
28536,How about a test? Your muscle against mine. The victor gains 100 gold coins from the loser.
28537,Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.
28540,Just your own two hands. Weapons and magic are out. Now let's see what you got!
28541,I said a hundred gold! Damn broke elves and damn broke elf-lovers.
28542,"All right. Fists only. And none of that magic stuff, either. Let's go!"
28543,Why don't you come back when you actually have a hundred gold?
28544,"Just fists. No weapons, no magic... no crying. Let's go!"
28545,"Hey, I may have had a few, but I can still count. You don't have a hundred septims on you."
28546,That's the spirit! Let's go.
28547,You're short on coin.
28548,This will be good training. Let's go!
28549,Did you use my good hammer?
28551,Last week a scholar came to us. He said he knew where we could find another fragment of Wuuthrad.
28552,Milk drinker.
28553,"One down, my friend. One down."
28554,They're masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting.
28555,"Not Lady Dibella? No, please! I can't lose her!"
28557,Milk drinker.
28558,We'll let it seem like it's his idea.
28560,Pfft. Snowback.
28561,You miss them? I don't know how many times I feared for my life.
28562,I am not. I have no more taste for Thalmor wine than I do for Thalmor company.
28563,Soft. Just like all outlanders.
28565,I'd almost given up hope. Let me get the door...
28566,"Ah, so the hunter came to know the fear of the hunted, hmm?"
28568,You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?
28569,"You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue."
28570,"You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip."
28572,No mother should have to bury her daughter.
28573,"Oh, well, it's just... I never imagined the Gourmet was a Khajiit. You know, because of all the fur, and the potential for getting hair in the..."
28574,"A lofty goal, to be sure. And what brings your search to our doorstep?"
28575,Remember. It was the Nords who locked you up.
28577,"Come, my men stand ready on the great porch."
28579,And now you've found me. Can I help you?
28580,"It's true, the scrolls are a subject of interest to us, and work has been done to learn of them. But outsiders are not allowed within the College."
28581,Koor...
28582,Spare some gold for a veteran?
28584,"Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was... well, angry to put it kindly."
28586,"Come on, Brynjolf... what is it this time?"
28587,"I wish there were another way, Dragonborn, but it falls to you to serve justice upon Paarthurnax."
28588,Thank you! I thought that beast would be the end of me!
28589,The Empire to bend its knee before those evil elf bastards? Signing a treaty meant to kill the heart of the Empire itself. To deny Talos? 
28591,I'll take a bottle of spiced wine.
28592,"A bottle of spiced wine for ya, Ataf?"
28593,"That's not what my scouts report, sir. Every day more join his cause. Riften, Dawnstar, and Winterhold support him."
28594,Control yourself! Do not frighten away our customers with your fits.
28596,No thank you. I'm still feeling sick from the festival.
28597,"Whatever it is you're up to at the College, you need to fix this at once!"
28598,Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens. Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.
28599,Ah a few bottles of Spiced Wine should hit the spot.
28600,Of course. And I'm sure it's mostly for ceremonial purposes.
28603,Plenty of ways to worship the Divines as you know.
28604,Not fair. You're well aware I can't seem to get warm here.
28605,"A bit of warming wine, Illdi. You know you can't resist."
28606,Do you know I look forward to Burning of King Olaf each year just because of the fire?
28607,I hope the Divines have been keeping you well.
28610,"You're damn right we'll accept it. If we pull this off, the Dark Brotherhood will know a fear and respect we haven't seen in centuries."
28613,"All right... All right... Fine. I thought we were friends, but you're a real jerk, you know that?"
28614,Colorful...
28617,Are your sales going well?
28618,"Yes, Listener?"
28619,"After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat."
28620,I couldn't be more pleased. Take this small token of my appreciation.
28621,Vittoria is practically glowing.
28622,"I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries."
28623,"Is that so? You ought to join the Stormcloaks, if you haven't already."
28625,Thanks!
28627,Help! Assassin!
28628,I went out ice fishing a few days ago.
28629,For Skyrim!
28631,"Brave man, with the Blackbloods out there. Did you catch anything?"
28633,"Naw, mostly just froze."
28634,"Well, keep at it. The fish have to get to know you before they're willing to bite."
28635,Ha! About time we got some more muscle in this city.
28636,Spiced Wine for the Winking Skeever?
28638,But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right.
28643,"First of all, one of our men was captured by rebels who refuse to surrender him. So we're going to break him out."
28644,"Sure, Sorex. Just like you did the last one."
28645,Only twenty gold septims! Hurry before my supply is gone.
28647,I'm sorry to hear that. I thought you'd finally seen through Ulfric's lies.
28648,Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.
28649,I don't like strangers...
28650, 
28651, 
28652,"No? Very well, it's your choice."
28654,"Aye, 'til next time."
28657,It's a shame you wished for something so dull as me taking back the mutt. Quite the lack of imagination on your part.
28660,I don't bother with silly pickpocketing jobs when I can make far more at the gambling table.
28661,"I should have been an adventurer like you, instead of a farmer."
28662,Keep on your guard. This city can be a little rough for those such us.
28663,Battle reveals who a man really is. Remember that.
28665,All that remains now is to bestow the title upon you.
28666,Watch yourself out there.
28668,"If you have need of tonics or potions, come see me at my shop."
28669,I hope to see you again soon.
28674,Good day to you.
28675,Be seeing you.
28676,I bid you safe travels.
28678,I surrender... I surrender...
28680,A most pleasant chat. Until the next!
28682,"Safe journeys, sword-brother."
28683,"A strong sword-arm wins battle, but a keen mind wins wars."
28685,You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away unless ya' can talk Maven Black-Briar into letting me outta' my debt.
28686,"But killing me would be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's your mother too, isn't she... Listener?"
28687,"If you meet anyone in your travels who needs good steel, send them my way."
28689,"Whether it's armor you need or a new blade, come see me."
28690,What are you talking about?
28691,What are you waiting for?
28693,Sometimes the difference between life an' death is a swift steed.
28695,"Ah, yes. Of course. No, I don't need anything."
28696,Everyone stay back. The Markarth city guard have this all under control. There are no Forsworn here.
28698,"I... I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye doesn't seem to have stopped."
28699,...
28700,Watch out some gray-skin doesn't pick your pocket.
28701,"Have a seat, there should be plenty of space."
28707,"As you travel Skyrim, make sure you stop and take in the view from time to time!"
28708,May you lose yourself in the pages of a good book!
28710,"You'll look back on this as one of your best decisions, I swear it."
28711,Do come again!
28712,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
28715,I can't believe it! How did ya' talk her into this?
28716,"If you'll excuse me, I must return to my duties."
28717,Glory to the Empress of Murk!
28718,It was a pleasure to talk to someone so interesting.
28720,Fair winds and calm seas. That's an old sailor's parting.
28721,"Forgive me milady, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed."
28724,The Greybeards have summoned the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. Such a thing has not happened for... hundreds of years.
28725,Svana! Has that skooma-addled idiot Niluva paid us her rent yet? Or does she have more excuses?
28728,Dammit...
28729,Bad idea.
28730,"If you've need of weapons or armor, come back and see Oengul."
28735,"Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day."
28736,"I think that's just their way. The Nords don't like anybody who's not a Nord, but they're not bad people, deep down."
28738,Let's try not to make too much noise. I've heard that cave-ins can start that way.
28739,"See you around, my beauty."
28741,"Cross the river and then head north. You'll see it, just past the falls."
28745,"See you around, handsome."
28746,"Be careful! That murderer could be anywhere, and anyone."
28750,Ah Potema. Former queen of Solitude and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history.
28751,Thank you for your custom.
28752,I've already told him. I don't have it!
28753,Don't forget them who's less fortunate than yourself.
28755,The Divines smile on a charitable soul.
28756,Hunh...
28757,"Not the sneaking type, huh?"
28763,May Talos bless your days.
28764,"Until our next meeting, honored friend."
28765,"We have not faired well outside our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things."
28767,"Farewell, then."
28768,"This here's Candlehearth Hall. Great room's upstairs, an' there's a bed for rent on the ground floor."
28769,"Talos protect you, friend."
28771,Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with the death of my wife and daughters...
28773,Get out of my face.
28774,"Strictly to cover damages, you understand. I believe 250 gold should be sufficient."
28775,"As an act of good faith on your part, I'd advise that you consider donating an amount of gold to the College."
28778,"I haven't changed my mind, if that's what you're asking. I won't leave Whiterun defenseless, even for a day."
28782,It cannot become widely known that these sorts of things happen here. Work will need to be done to keep this quiet.
28785,Liars and bastards. Every one of them. I'd have their heads on a pike if it wasn't for the war effort.
28786,"Please, follow me. I'll escort you inside the College."
28788,Hmm. Maybe in a few seasons I could afford such a treasure.
28789,I thought I made it clear that this sort of behavior is totally unacceptable.
28790,"There were only three of us left. Takes-In-Light just sat down and gave up, and we left her there to die."
28792,You're going to Fort Snowhawk.
28793,"Bolar has been in a bad mood for weeks, now."
28794,"Wait, is that a tail?"
28795,Let's get this over with.
28796,Keep your guard up.
28798,These matters are becoming more difficult to deal with. I'm going to need 1000 gold from you in order to make reparations.
28799,It's most unfortunate that we need to have this discussion once again.
28801,I overheard Bolli say that only the Jarl carries the key to the warehouse.
28803,Twenty-five years ago I was standing outside these very same ruins. Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why.
28804,You won't get away.
28805,I made it rather clear that a donation of 500 gold will clear it up rather neatly.
28807,"Then, as I've said, 1000 gold will be required to set things right."
28809,You really should be more careful with the spells you cast.
28813,"And I'll make sure the suspension is lifted. I'm glad we were able to clear this matter up, and I do hope we don't need to have this talk again."
28816,"This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands here, not least Malborn's life."
28818,Been doing a few jobs for Vex... how about you?
28820,Consider the suspension lifted.
28821,"Fear neither pain, nor darkness. For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in their hands, and courage in their hearts."
28822,Yes. I hope this will be enough to maintain order.
28823,That's a sensible lad. Now fetch me drink.
28827,Can you help me find someone? There's gold in it for you.
28829,"Oh gods, what did you do that for? This is horrible. I'm not paying for murder. Get away from me."
28830,Get over to Winterhold.
28832,"Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing threat."
28835,"Well, as you know, the Guild's growing and things are looking up around here."
28836,"Yes, Legate. No one is getting through us."
28837,"Soon, Namira's blessing will be yours."
28838,I don't think he likes either Ulfric or Elisif much. Who can blame him?
28840,"What? You, alone, reasoning with the Thalmor? That's madness, friend."
28841,Of course not! Thieves take what is precious. Thieves steal.
28842,"I don't see the Arch-Mage. He must've been blown clear. I need you to find him immediately, all right? Make sure he's safe."
28843,Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
28844,"Get moving, now. I'll be fine."
28845,"Come on, Arniel. Let's go."
28847,"Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth."
28848,"If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city."
28853,Do we have to? They'd never lift a finger to help us.
28854,That looks like it's the last of them.
28855,"You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily."
28857,We'll stay here. Get back to the College and let them know what's going on.
28858,"If that doesn't interest you, feel free to walk away."
28859,It's none of your concern. All you need to know is that we're paying for information.
28860,And these men and women - they call themselves Stormcloaks because they believe in you...
28862,"I can take a hint, lass. You want to make some coin, come find me."
28864,Good luck with that Icewraith.
28866,"Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full.  Here's the key to the shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next level. "
28867,"Don't keep waiting, soldier."
28868,"Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, less flavorful place."
28869,"Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our sake."
28870,I know you're here somewhere.
28872,"Shut up, will you?"
28873,I thought I gave you something to do?
28874,"You have your orders, soldier."
28875,To Whiterun with you.
28876,"Don't underestimate my son, Skuli. He may look young, but he can handle any drunks we get."
28877,Get those documents to Whiterun.
28879,We want compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
28884,That was over 500 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.
28887,"All I can think about is my son, my Thorald... they say that he was killed, but I know better. I know my son is alive!"
28889,"You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back."
28891,"It can't be traced back to me, can it? Was there lot's of crying? I hope so."
28892,Fight or die well.
28893,So the Alik'r know where I am? What did they offer you? Gold? How many more of them are coming?
28894,I want to thank you for your help. I know my master can be a bit short at times.
28895,You aren't fooling me. Trusted witnesses have seen you commit several murders.
28897,"Though, admittedly... it helps."
28898,"Here, you should have this."
28899,"Oh, I'm sorry about that."
28901,"Speak. You can ask anything of me, love."
28903,"You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster."
28904,"You don't think this is a war already? Sir, I..."
28906,Let me do the talking.
28907,When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form.
28910,An outsider? No reason to stop in Kynesgrove. Keep moving.
28911,Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense.
28912,Don't you go trackin' your dirty boots on my clean floor!
28913,Better this one than me.
28914,Sir.
28918,Not bad. 
28919,I could take her.
28920,It always is.
28921,I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.
28922,"The interrogations are quite merciless, from what I've heard. "
28923,She might just make it.
28925,He might just make it.
28927,Posh. I'm not paying for it. Put it on Bolli's account if you please.
28928,This is the Hall of the Dead. Someday you'll end up here.
28930,How's the newcomer look?
28931,"Sorry about the smell. It's a stable, after all."
28933,Bah! Stop wasting my time!
28934,Don't just stand there.
28935,Come at me. You couldn't hurt me if you wanted to.
28938,I was this close to catching that killer. I swear it.
28940,Pretty good arm you have there.
28942,There you go!
28943,"Sahloknir, krii daar joorre."
28945,We're all eager to see them brought to justice. Maven Black-Briar has assured me that they're being dealt with appropriately. 
28947,Falmer patrol up ahead. I don't think they know we're here.
28948,"You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah."
28951,Lady Mara will save us from these nightmares. You'll see.
28955,Stormcloaks took Markarth. It is good to see Talos worshipped openly again.
28957,Please... I... not now...
28958,Yet here you are with my weapon that you could have easily sold or kept for yourself.
28959,And then I would wake up. And hope that it was just a dream... but know that it was not.
28961,"With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't seen in decades."
28962,"What do you need, handsome?"
28963,Oof!
28966,Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
28967,Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
28969,Don't bother me again unless it's important.
28971,"She still mourns greatly for her husband, High King Torygg. So she leaves many of the courtly details to me."
28973,"Stay out of trouble, now."
28974,Back to another fine day in Dawnstar.
28976,Let me know if you come down with the Rattles.
28979,We forge every day if you need anything.
28980,That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times.
28982,Come back if you need steel.
28983,"Before I can present you with the title, there's but a single requirement you must fulfill."
28984,"This both enhances our connection to the realm of magic, and eliminates possible interference from outside sources."
28986,"Damned Imperial lies! My men would never stoop to such methods, even in retaliation for your butchery at..."
28989,That's right. Home of the Redguards. The land of sand and seas.
28990,"If you're looking for a handout, you're not going to get one from me."
28991,"Meyz mul, Dovahkiin. You have become strong."
28993,Then stop wasting my time.
28994,"If you were anyone else, I'd make you leave."
28997,"You don't deserve to call yourself an Orc! You're weak, you're small, and you're an embarrassment!"
28998,He would never have willingly parted with it. What a shame.
29002,By Ysgramor's axe! It's true. Morthal owes you a debt.
29004,I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.
29006,"Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a master vampire I thought was destroyed a century ago."
29008,Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be asking?
29009,"The rumors say the culprits are vampires. I try not to listen to swaggle like that, but figured you should know."
29010,So it's true. That traitorous bitch! Morthal owes you a debt.
29012,Things look quiet enough here. Come on. There's my uncle.
29013,Wonderful. I'll write it out so you won't forget it.
29014,Truly?
29015,"When word came that he'd fallen, his son Deroct lit the candle in his honor. Nobody knows why it still burns."
29017,"Quickly, what is it?"
29018,Mikael is quite the songbird. Maybe he's the reason you're here all the time.
29020,"I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty."
29021,"It's not often I get visitors out here. You lost, stranger?"
29024,One group has hidden out in Winterhold.
29026,One group has hidden out in Eastmarch.
29027,Good. We should keep moving.
29028,"Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?"
29029,One group has hidden out in the Rift.
29030,One group has hidden out in the Pale.
29031,Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
29035,One group has hidden out in the Reach.
29036,"Get it back, for the honor of us all."
29037,"We know there's an actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial..."
29038,"Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Sister."
29039,"Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Brother."
29040,The Staff is said to be able to absorb great amounts of energy. Perhaps it can interact with the Eye in a way that nothing else can.
29041,"Reputation, mostly. A lot of Khajiit turn to smuggling and thievery to get by."
29042,I don't see these troubles as business. This is a labor of honor. 
29043,"I respect Eorlund, but he has the good fortune to work the Skyforge. Something about the fires... their steel just holds tighter."
29044,Every bit as sharp as what you'll find in Whiterun. 
29045,"Papa says I'm too friendly with strangers, but you seem all right."
29046,If that makes any sense.
29047,"You know what I mean. Forges have personalities, right?"
29049,"Riften's biggest exports used to be fishing and honey, until the Black-Briar family moved in. Now the meadery is the biggest game in town."
29051,"Well yes, of course you had to go and mention that."
29052,"He seems to value my thoughts, and I'm grateful for that. "
29055,"Whether this was intentional or not, it suggests some interesting results."
29056,"Ahh, hmm. Yes. I, err, I was unaware that I had forgotten that. I will, err, I mean I'll take care of that as soon as possible."
29058,Lot of history in these walls. We're trying to make some more. It's a lucky time to be alive.
29059,"I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here."
29062,"Grew up here. Colder as Atmora, but that just grows the beards thicker!"
29064,We both leave well enough alone.
29067,The only reason you could disagree is because you are losing so badly you cannot see it.
29068,"Power is the crux of this world. There's always more of it to be had, if you look in the right places."
29069,"We're united, but where should we live? My home is yours, of course."
29071,You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you people a single coin.
29072,"He's... he's not the best teacher. But just watching him, I've learned so much."
29073,"Sir, we can't just keep trading blows with the rebels like this - it's only strengthening their resolve."
29075,Are you kidding? I came all the way from Cyrodiil just to work with him.
29078,Haelga! That's just it. I can't keep up with you. Your Dibellan techniques... they're exhausting.
29080,"Carry the blessings of Mara with you, so the rest of the province may shine with her glories."
29082,I'll carry on his tradition as best I can. I could spend a lifetime just going over his notes.
29083,"I'm going to find whoever did this, and when I do..."
29084,"I cannot go into battle without a sword, Hjalti."
29089,Sometimes cargo goes missing. 
29091,Wield powerful magic incantations!
29094,"We work where we can get work. The Nords don't like unloading their ships, so we do it instead."
29095,If the Greybeards were willing to host a peace council... then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.
29097,<humming>
29098,"I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs."
29099,"I came here as a hatchling. The only thing colder than Skyrim is the Nords themselves, but we stick together."
29100,"Ah, good, good. Now please, take this. Just my way of saying thanks."
29103,"Slow, but looking good, sir."
29104,"Near as I can tell, a bunch of ancient Nord hermits who live on top of a mountain."
29106,"Not so tough now, are you?"
29107,"It takes half a day just to dig a planting row in the cold, stony earth here. But what else can we do, eat rocks and ice?"
29109,"Yes, yes. We must think. He must have some means of travelling to and from Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be."
29111,"The Greybeards are masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift."
29116,Just got here from the Summerset Isles. Lots of opportunity in Skyrim. 
29118,And this inn has the very bed the great general slept in on his first night as Old Hroldan's liberator. As good as it was hundreds of years ago.
29120,I don't think Ulfric knew how much Torygg respected him for that.
29121,"Septim would later found the Empire that united Tamriel, but his first known battle and victory was right here."
29123,"Yes, Listener? How may I serve you?"
29125,I have faith that you'll return with King Olaf's Verse.
29126,I've got some salmon to sell.
29127,"I'll tell you what, let me find out where that's from. I'll need to look through my library... and get you an answer."
29128,"And as if that wasn't enough. I got this damn Orc hanging around, getting in the way, yapping about needing help with some kind of vision quest."
29129,"Seems Brina Merilis and the Legion came and now she's Jarl. That's a relief. I don't like the fighting, but Brina is the woman for the job."
29130,This way everyone! Over here!
29131,"Stop it, both of you. You're acting like children."
29132,He's been gone for a long while. Too long.
29133,My aunt died. Things won't be the same without her.
29136,Go ahead and play your little joke.
29137,"Cedran said he'd... what am I paying you for? Next time, you bring the shipment in yourself."
29139,The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand going up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the Legion.
29140,Just a little one! I was hungry!
29141,"I'm sorry, milady. The components for those elixirs are quite volatile and in some cases, very dangerous to handle. I must take care."
29142,"I am so very sorry. I went over this again and again, and I was sure it would have better results."
29144,One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings show a crown?
29145,You've got no idea. Half the men in Whiterun have proposed to me. Some were even single.
29147,It should be careful with those flames.
29149,Pfft. I'm the oldest woman in Dawnstar. Was here when the Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger.
29151,You better know what you're doing.
29153,"The land is beautiful, but I can't stand this cold. I don't know how Rustleif manages it."
29154,"You touch her, and I swear it'll be your fingers that go missing, you stupid Breton!"
29156,I... I don't want to talk.
29158,"Ulfric's capital is Windhelm, northeast of here. You'll want to talk to Galmar Stone-Fist, Ulfric's right-hand man. He handles the new recruits."
29160,"You have something to say, dog? Something on your mind?"
29162,"Ah, but when you're done, there's no use returning here, is there? I was thinking... the Dawnstar Sanctuary. We could make a proper home there."
29163, 
29164,Wasn't long before I saw more of the world than I bargained for. 
29165,"I joined the Legion to see the world. I know, that's one of those things people say, but it's completely true in my case."
29167,My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil. I must have inherited their wanderlust...
29170,"If you need potions, you should try Arcadia's Cauldron."
29173,"Don't get me wrong, every country has its dark corners. But that's why we're here. To bring order and civilization, and to protect the people."
29175,"Cyrodiil is a beautiful place, full of diverse peoples and histories. But so too, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and every other place I've been."
29176,Home? Home to me is a hot cup of ale at the end of the day and five minutes without someone needing something from me...
29177,"And more, dribbling in from time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be completed at your leisure."
29178,"I managed to pick the lock and slip out while the guard slept, but now I'm completely lost. Can you help me, please?"
29179,"I've had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I hope it brings you the same luck."
29181,I've been thinking about building that cabin we talked about.
29182,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
29183,And I've seen the face of evil. It was in the air above Sentinel on the Night of Green Fire.
29185,"The throne suits me, don't you think?"
29186,"If we send half our guards to aid the legions, just for a few days, it could tip the scales in the Empire's favor."
29188,But they send the Legion to places that've gotten too bad to be settled without violence. What's hard is seeing good people warped by evil.
29190,The life of a soldier is full of hardship. That's nothing.
29191,"Queen of Solitude, granddaughter of Emperor Uriel Septim II, five hundred years ago. Her fight for succession nearly tore the empire apart."
29193,For the glory of the Empire.
29196,It matters little if some of the people here are ignorant to that truth. They are still citizens of the Empire. It's our solemn duty to protect them.
29197,"Wish I did, but some outlander bought my last one."
29198,Ulfric and his thugs are stirring up trouble for their own agenda. The Empire is the only thing keeping the Dominion from walking all over Skyrim.
29199,"Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?"
29201,What is it? Dragons?
29203,"Really? Great! Okay. So, first, you raise your ward and I'll throw a little spell at it. That way I can see the ""right"" way to do things."
29204,Who in the name of Azura are you?
29206,"Better question would be ""what did he leave."""
29209,"Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job."
29211,"I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who where stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived."
29212,Suddenly an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter. Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own.
29213,"Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to track down some refugee relatives who had fled persecution in Alinor."
29214,"Well, I don't know. Not yet... it flew over the town and landed on the old dragon mound!"
29217,"If you don't mind me saying so, Ahlam, your husband is a damn fool. Any moment spent thinking about him is a moment wasted."
29218,"The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament."
29219,Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.
29220,What is it?
29221,"Well met, mage of Skyrim."
29222,It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound.
29223,See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. I never understood how my sister could stand living in the shadow of that place.
29227,"If it's my fate to be ended by a dragon, so be it. Meantime, I'll live my life the way I want to."
29228,My pa used to say there ain't no use worryin' about the things you can't change. 
29229,Creature like that'll make a man think long and hard about what he wants out of life.
29230,There's hagravens in that cave with talons like daggers. They'll open your bowels quick as a wink if you let 'em get close.
29234,We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!
29237,Hmm... Your creature doesn't appear to be fairing any better than before. Methinks your aim is off.
29238,You seem to be having a small problem... or perhaps it's a big problem? Maybe if you shrunk the whole thing down a little first?
29240,Of course it is. That's what happens when you're partners with a corrupt Imperial whore like Maven. 
29241,By the gods. The Emperor's been murdered. On his own ship... moored in the inlet. It was... the Dark Brotherhood. There was nothing we could do...
29242,Still can't wake him up? Perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree? 
29243,Free of charge for you.
29247,I'll need a whole crate of fruit. That Varnius Junius went through quite a few of our supplies.
29249,The guy in from Dragon Bridge? He didn't seem the type.
29250,Have anything interesting to tell me?
29256,"Got a client in desperate need for this item. He won't say what it's for, and we don't care. Can you take this one?"
29262,You never can tell.
29263,Feim!
29265,"Here, this is fresh. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow."
29266,I keep coming out here thinking I'll see what others see in this... frivolity.
29267,"Would it kill you to let a man go about his business in peace? Really, the nerve..."
29268,"The temple contract? Well, I certainly won't deny my involvement. He he he he he."
29270,Please hurry -- I fear my master doesn't have much time left.
29272,"If there's any more I can help you with, just let me know."
29274,Aghh..
29275,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
29276,"Another day, another septim."
29278, 
29279,I don't think that was a compliment.
29281,Get over to Whiterun. We're mounting our final attack!
29284,"Aye. I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the Guild."
29285,Sometimes I like to think my cooking is like playing the flute or singing a song.
29287,"I've tasted your food, Odar. It's better than most songs I've heard."
29288,I once saw Fihada put an arrow in between the eyes of a Blackblood Marauder at five hundred paces.
29292,"Oh. I... well, I honestly didn't expect you to come back. Of course, I'm glad you did!"
29294,"C'mon, let's get something to eat."
29297,Thanks. Papa talks about it some. Mum doesn't say much since Uncle Roggvir died. She doesn't even go to Temple anymore.
29298,Walking around with your weapon out is bound to make people nervous. We understand each other? 
29299,"If there's still a Legion left, Adara. I'm sure you'd make a great soldier. Just like your brother."
29303,You would do that? That's great. You should go do it right now.
29306,You take it back then? You retract your statement? Well?
29308,"Come now. Whatever the problem, we can talk about it like civilized folk. Hmm?"
29310,"Just pay them, Bersi!"
29311,Malacath rewards the strong and punishes the weak.
29314,Yatul and I tend to dote on Mauhulakh. You know how aunts can be with their favorite nephew.
29316,"Of course, it would be much easier to check with an alchemist. They occasionally have them for sale."
29317,Thanks.
29320,Attack!
29321,"Master, you're not truly considering accepting her?"
29322,Well now. I guess I owe you my thanks.
29323,"We can't hold them! Go, Casimir! Run!"
29325,(Laughing.)
29330,"No, you're right. After all this time, Ulfric still holds almost half of Skyrim."
29331,"Some of them, anyway. "
29332,Get out of here before I call the guards!
29333,"That's right! Papa helped me with the clasps, but I did all the links on my own."
29337,"Yeah, whatever."
29338,You have the look of a killer.
29341,"Next thing I know, I've used up most of my stock."
29344,"Well, you clearly possess the minimum aptitude required. Congratulations. I'll escort you up to the gate."
29345,"But that's your problem, not mine."
29348,The catch is you can't kill anyone who lives there or you forfeit the payment.
29351,"Ah, there you are."
29353,Anyone see anything?
29354,Lock the city gate.
29357,Positions.
29360,"So, you're here to help?"
29367,Did you happen to discover where the fetcher was getting his skooma from?
29370,I could listen to her play all day.
29374,Speaking of harsh.
29375,Not in our nature.
29376,Do you miss your days training at the College?
29378,"Okay, what'll it be?"
29379,Absolutely not. I prefer to be near enough to come visit but free to come and go as I please.
29381,I'm so glad we got to have it. I thought for sure Elisif would never consent.
29382,"Skald, I've been meaning to ask you for a leave of absence. I wish to return to High Rock until this war is over."
29383,"By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!"
29384,"Well, you can understand Elisif not wanting it."
29386,I think our flutist here has gotten better since the Burning of King Olaf.
29388,You and everyone else. Word is it may not happen this year though.
29389,"Oh, no. But being surrounded by good music, good drink and good friends is all I've ever asked for."
29391,"Generally, if you want rumors, you should talk to Corpulus. That said... I did see a visitor pass through on his way to the Blue Palace."
29393,"Sir, I will shape them up but with the war on it is unwise to reduce their wages any further. "
29394,"Fine, Ataf. You should eat some more tomatoes, though."
29395,"No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it... she won't be using it to escape."
29396,"Perhaps if I were a little more blessed I could afford to give away my fruit. As is you'll have to pay, Rorlund."
29397,Is it over?
29398,"My daughter Braith says I read too much. ""Play with me, mother!"" Girls need to learn how to take care of themselves."
29399,It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...
29404,Good. Here's the outfit. Try to get Elisif's opinion on it and if she likes it mention it's from Radiant Raiment.
29405,"Give em the dogs, boys!"
29407,Then I guess we're done talking.
29409,"I've heard rumors of the resting place of the Helm of Winterhold, the very same helm that Jarl Hanse wore in the First Era."
29411,"Yes. The finest court in all of High Rock. You think politics here are something? Well, we Bretons invented politics."
29412,The Alik'r are not permitted within the city walls.
29414,Got something for just about everybody in here. Give a holler if you have any questions.
29415,I'd just assume die before I'd let Mercer get those gems.
29416,"Take a good look around. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. If not, let me know, I might have it stored away."
29419,Just make sure you get back out of there alive with the information we need.
29420,"Rather convincing, don't you think?"
29422,This place is unbelievable.
29423,"This time let's try ""The Age of Aggression"". I will demonstrate for the class."
29425,"Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. Come on in, take a look around."
29426,"Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started."
29427,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Reach. Congratulations."
29431,"Yes, yes, I know. I just wish to show them there's more to life than drowning your sorrows in a goblet of mead."
29432,I left for a few days in Riften. When I came back Bashnag accused me of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. I was cursed and chased off.
29435,"For your sake, I hope you're right. Because if it is you, and Maven finds out, the Dreth family is going to be one member smaller."
29436, 
29437,A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.
29438,Please. Please just let me be...
29442,And I've waited. Even after the enemies' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited.
29443,"Oh, do come in! I hope I have what you need."
29445,"It's down the stairs, dear. Just come right in."
29448,"Hush, Salma. We aren't alone."
29449,Good that you're so eager.
29450,"Always good to see folk come back for more. You need a drink, you just let me know."
29453,"My story, huh? Everyone in Cidhna Mine has a tale. Let's hear yours first. When was the first time you felt chains around your wrists?"
29454,"If you are here to purchase, I have many spells available. Do come in."
29455,"You're either the bravest person I've ever met, or the biggest fool."
29456,You lost?
29459,Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
29462,"It is time, Yamarz."
29464,It's been a pleasure.
29470,"Oh, Fastred. I'm not sure what happened. One moment she's smiling at me, the next I can't even meet her eyes."
29471,"Romantic, isn't? Like that time we first met. Remember that? Never seen so much blood. Ah, to be young again..."
29473,"I suppose we'll continue this at some later time, when we can avoid interruptions."
29478,"Nothing, nothing at all! Arniel already overpaid for... whatever it is."
29479,"That's a lie! My legionnaires are disciplined, unlike your..."
29481,"Ha, nothing like fine spirits to help raise your... well, your spirits! "
29482,Oho! Manservant? Is that what I am now?
29483,"Yes, I think I'd enjoy a woman like your wife."
29486,"I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's much I can help you with."
29487,I don't think I need to tell you why.
29490,Malacath witness our deeds.
29491,Good. And you'll have a chance to prove it to me soon enough.
29492,"Oh, it's you again. What in blazes do you want?"
29493,Because I did something not a soul in this bloodstained house of war has the backbone to do... dared to speak my mind.
29494,Auxiliary.
29495,It was the blade hefted by Ysgramor when he returned to drive the elves out of the old Skyrim.
29503,But why did they take her? What could they want with our little girl?
29504,"Ah, is there any way you'd rather spend the day than drinking Honningbrew Mead?"
29505,Hi! I've never seen you around here before. Are you a miner too?
29507,Lookin' forward to it.
29508,Why's that?
29512,Now you're mine!
29513,You must take the Lexicon from me. Please... take it now.
29514,"Oh come on, leave it alone. He's gone. There's no use in talking about it anymore."
29515,"The memories. I cannot stand them. You must take them away, return them to Avanchnzel."
29517,Don't you know there's a dragon attacking?
29518,We should not...
29522,Wait. Something's wrong.
29524,Are you prepared to make that commitment?
29525,"It seems to be spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften. The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds."
29526,The College will not fall!
29528,Lead us to your Sybil.
29530,"My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty."
29531,"Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots. Good job."
29535,They have to be reasonable about it at some point.
29536,"Heard me a rumor, boy. Something about you putting bugs in the stew over at the Sleeping Giant. You do this?"
29537,Let's see what Esbern has to say.
29538,"Best you forget whatever you think you saw, elf. Such idle talk can prove hazardous to one's health."
29540,"That's nice, son. Just don't stomp on the crop like last time!"
29541,"You could, you know, let me out of this cage now."
29542,"Whiterun is the crown jewel of Skyrim, and you would leave us defenseless?"
29544,"When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to."
29546,These pillars must have something to do with it.
29548,Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law! 
29555,"Ah, that's excellent news. This will be most helpful in furthering my research."
29560,"So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed."
29561,"We got rooms and food. Drink, too. I cook. Ain't much else to tell."
29566,"Ingun, you clumsy fool! You've tainted our entire supply of Painted Troll Fat. You have no idea how hard that was to get."
29568,As you wish. Speak to me again if you decide to purchase some decorations for your home.
29570,Just... just stop. And I'll tell you where I've hidden my treasure.
29571,You need an escort at all times.
29572,"Your family's success burdens you, does it?"
29573,Is there anything else you'd like to purchase?
29574,"Very well, just let me know when you have the necessary funds."
29576,I'll bet Bassianus would know what's going on. He understands women.
29577,Ah. I forget. You do not have the dovah speech.
29578,"It isn't just your blood that a vampire wants, it's your mortal soul."
29579,Wonderful! Here is the key to your new home.
29581,"Mighty Arkay, I pray that you will shepherd these souls as they pass into the realm of death."
29582,"Yes, my Brother. Forgive me. May the blessing of Peryite be with you."
29583,"I'm done for, little cub. Go. Run for it!"
29585,Let's just hope they got it right this time.
29586,These dreams are manifestations created by the Daedric Lord Vaermina.
29587,Splendid! There's a house available right now.
29589,This is why I say we take the fight to them. Gather the Legion and drive those blasted beasts out of the Reach for good.
29594,"Now, what would you like to purchase?"
29595,"I understand your hesitation, but I promise you that it works."
29599,You are banished!
29600,So how are things with you and Bolli?
29601,"I'll be glad to help you. There are many ways to improve your home, provided you have the coin."
29605,Now I'm going to have to kill you!
29606,My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply for irony's sake.
29607,No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.
29609,Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little rebellion of theirs once and for all.
29610,Oh thank goodness! I wasn't sure where else to turn...
29611,What a waste of time.
29612,I thought you were a wizard. Hit me with a spell!
29613,"This is better than sitting around talking about magic, don't you think?"
29615,Took an incredible amount of work to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it.
29616,"Place the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process for focusing it."
29618,It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.
29619,"It was an old Nord proverb. It said, the best way to get over the loss of a lover is to find a new one."
29621,We need to talk.
29622,I think you're looking for this.
29626,"You're not the first person to come in here asking about him, either, so be careful."
29629,"Kynesgrove is this way. We can travel together or split up and meet there, your choice."
29633,"Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you."
29634,Someday I'm going to kill a dragon all by myself.
29635,Aav uv dir. Join me or perish with your mortal friends.
29636,Assorted wares and tools you just can't live without! Come and see for yourself!
29637,"Yes, I'm positive I heard something."
29638,"Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!"
29639,I just...  can't take the pain. Not a second longer.
29640,"Use Dragonrend, Dovahkiin!"
29641,He is too strong on the wing! Bring him to gol with Dragonrend!
29642,The Justiciars know your face. And we elves have long memories...
29643,There's someone that wants to see him put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know.
29644,You can't beat me!
29645,Here you are. So sorry about that.
29646,"Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend."
29647,What was it like? Cidhna Mine? We've all been talking about your escape. And being pardoned after. Amazing.
29651,Did you just wander in out of the white? 
29652,He is too strong on the wing! Bring him to gol with Dragonrend!
29654,"They're parasites. They're living in our city, under our protection, but what do they do for us? Nothing!"
29655,Do not delay. Alduin will be coming. He cannot miss the signs.
29656,"It's not exactly forbidden, but even so... it's not true. So that's that."
29657,There is no question. You are doom-driven. Kogaan Akatosh. The very bones of the earth are at your disposal.
29658,You have it. The Kel - the Elder Scroll. Tiid kreh... qalos. Time shudders at its touch.
29659,"I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara."
29660,"Ah, I have a pretty staff. Help me find Petra, wring her neck, pluck her eyes. Take my prize staff, I just want my tower back!"
29661,"As long as we keep Talos in our heart, his legacy will never die."
29666,It's going to take a lot more than that.
29668,"Thank you, Harbinger."
29671,Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.
29672,Why would anyone join the Stormcloaks? They have a fraction of the Empire's wealth and power.
29673,I can. Here. This is fresh. I'll have another one made tomorrow.
29674,"A welcome to you, fellow traveler."
29675,"Well done. Here, a token of appreciation."
29676,"Make a move toward Balgruuf, and you're dead."
29678,But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?
29683,"Here you are. I added a little mead into the recipe. I think it tastes better. Let me know what you think tomorrow, I'll make another one."
29684,Here. This is from a recipe my people have passed on to me. I can cook another tomorrow.
29686,Here. Wouldn't want you going into a fight on an empty stomach. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.
29688,"*Sigh*... and that's the last one. All right, enough of this."
29689,The trees... they're beautiful here. Reminds me of autumn at home.
29690,"Esbern, what..."
29691,I'll take care of it.
29692,"If you want some information about the area, Annekke knows it better than anyone."
29693,"Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it."
29694,"Yes, yes! Did Arch-Mage Aren send you? He sent you to rescue me, didn't he? "
29695,Tribune.
29696,There's the one about Tiber Septim and the dragon Nafaalilargus. I never bothered to learn it.
29699,At least the Nords don't shirk their responsibilities.
29700,Vengeance for Laelette!
29701,You deserve something for sniffing out that thief. Here.
29702,"Unbelievable! You must be the first person to set eyes on all twenty-four of them in... well, the last two eras."
29703,Are you?
29705,The bastards... somehow they managed to kill Skjor.
29707,What is that half-naked fetcher trying to prove?
29708,Destroy the intruder!
29709,There you are.
29711,Degaine the beggar got himself kicked out the Temple of Dibella. Caused quite the ruckus.
29712,"Oh, you old charmer."
29713,"You might want to rethink that. You're missing out on some wonderful opportunities, working in that bar."
29718,And where would that be?
29719,"If she's the best Ulfric has to offer, we might've been better off with the Imperials."
29721,Oh really? And where were you thinking?
29722,"There's trouble up in Winterhold. I'm a little surprised anyone's complaining about it, but money is money."
29724,"One moment, I know, time is of the essence, but mustn't leave secrets for the Thalmor... there's one more I must bring..."
29725,"Lucan, I was thinking we should have a grand sale. Lower the prices by half, maybe get some jugglers. We could attract lots of new customers."
29726,One of the new servants? Remember that I like my meat rare.
29729,Yes? No? Nothing?
29730,You want to move? Where?
29731,Horses are all I know. I've been riding since I could walk.
29732,"The blood calls, sister."
29736,Where are you thinking?
29737,Fancy robes. You a wizard or somethin'?
29742,"Do I look like a guide? Only thing I do is sell meat. Now, are you going to buy or not?"
29743,"What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?"
29744,"I'll be waiting for you at home, then."
29746,"Mother, what can I do to make father happier? It seems no matter how successful I become he doesn't care."
29747,Get away!
29748,"I'll see you at home, then. Don't keep me waiting!"
29751,By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after - perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.
29752,A home for the two of us. I'll meet you there.
29753,You're doing me quite a favor. I won't forget it.
29754,Our new home. I'll see you there!
29755,All right. I'll see you there.
29756,"Oh, Astrid..."
29759,I'll meet you there.
29760,"Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory."
29761,"You there! As an officer of the Imperial Legion, I require your assistance to complete my mission."
29763,"It's done, then. Justice, if you can call it that."
29765,Thanks again for delivering that ore sample.
29766,He killed six Imperial Guards before they dragged him into the prisons.
29769,"Hard to believe it was just a coincidence, that the first dragon anyone's seen for centuries attacks just as Ulfric was about to be executed."
29770,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
29773,Releasing a captured dragon. I don't think I'll ever understand that one...
29775,"Killing Commander Maro would do no good. Someone would merely replace him. No, we need him to remain in charge. But... distracted. Weakened."
29776,"I'll be here, my dear."
29779,"Conquer your enemies, my love."
29780,"Bye, love."
29781,Death is highly overrated!
29782,Come now. What everyone else is saying. It can't possibly be true...
29783,Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?
29784,"The same words were used to greet the young Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor Tiber Septim."
29786,What are you doing?
29787,We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has accepted our guidance.
29789,You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.
29791,Some are saying the Psijic Monks have been seen in Skyrim. They're an ancient order. I had 'em figured for dead.
29792,"The finished material has the delicate nature of fresh powder snow, but the strength of the hardest steel."
29794,"He's an accomplished wizard. And, locating him may be challenging, as he travels with the caravans."
29798,"Jurgen Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition, and the Way of the Voice was born."
29800,"He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory of men."
29801,There's hardly ever time to make the occasional delivery to the taverns of Skyrim.
29805,Trying to stay alive. I think time's running out though. I'm pretty sure the Thalmor know where I am.
29806,"General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously! I thought we were here to discuss a truce!"
29808,It should be quite the affair. Nice to have something happy in the midst of the war.
29813,"Very well, then. If that's the way you want to play it, we will."
29814,You think you stand a chance?
29816,When are those Silver-Blood men going to leave?
29819,"Father, how come Olda's so mean to everyone? She's only ever happy when she's with Lodvar, and she's not even married to him! "
29821,Your destiny requires you to use your Voice - why else would Akatosh have bestowed this power upon you?
29822,I'm very disappointed. I'd advise you to rethink that decision soon.
29823,"But... he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire."
29824,"Excellent, then they'll be no need to devote any resources to stopping it. Thank you, Anuriel. That will be all."
29826,You... you're an Argonian! Where did you learn to cook like that? Surely not in Black Marsh. Why even the...
29827,"Oh, don't be such an old stick, Horik. I was joking. I can do that, you know. Redo the battle plans. I'll look over them later."
29828,Ancano is exactly why we're so restrictive about access to the College. We'd all have perished if it weren't for you.
29831,Look at the young ones scrap!
29832,"I'm sorry, were you about to say something?"
29833,We will see about this...
29834,"Well, we have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation, so don't get sentimental on me now."
29838,Better make sure.
29840,It fills us with rage. What harm does it bring to us now?
29841,Slay him in the coldest of blood. Do not give him the dignity of defending himself.
29845,Falkreath trades with the surrounding holds and without our wood they would have trouble keeping their prices low.
29849,"Other people just make things complex. Out here, Hern and I can get everything we need from the occasional traveler."
29853,The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our most recent inductee.
29856, 
29857,"Here you go, miss. Colovian brandy."
29858,You're lookin' at a real warrior! At least I used to be.
29859,But do you know what intrigues me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you.
29860,You handled yourself pretty well back at Japhet's Folly. We'll remember that.
29865,That's what they say.
29866,"Lucky for us it attacked when it did, eh? I wasn't looking forward to getting a shave from the Imperial headsman."
29867,He he he he he he he he he he.
29868,I can't thank you enough for what you did. 
29869,"You know, this is one of a very few places where you can receive a real education in the schools of magic."
29871,I'm going to make you sorry for this!
29872,"Come on, give it your best shot!"
29874,Please. My family means too much to me. Don't hurt them.
29878,Woof.
29881,"My heart goes out to them. If only our coffers were deeper, I could protect them as they were my own family."
29882,How can they continue to lead their already meager lives with dark clouds looming overhead?
29884,The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.
29885,"Come now, dearie, surely we aren't all that bad."
29888,"With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat."
29890,One of the terms of the treaty was the outlawing of worship to Talos.
29891,"Sure, sure. Got one that should be pretty easy, as long as you keep your weapon sheathed. Can you handle it?"
29894,"Good luck. If you get a chance, look me up in Solitude."
29895,"But just in case, I'll be ready for them."
29897,I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life.
29899,Indeed. There have been multiple attempts on the Jarl's life. We're not certain if it's the Dark Brotherhood or simply Imperial sympathizers.
29900,How do we know she's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
29901,"Then you know where we stand. Make your kill, and we're square. Repayment of your debt is but a discreet knife thrust away."
29902,We want compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
29903,"Goodness, no!"
29904,"No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true son of Skyrim. You'll know what to do."
29905,"We were children, sure. But Roggvir never outgrew that immaturity, or his cruelty. So any talk about him being an ""honorable"" Nord? Pure folly. "
29907,A few months ago it was troll fat salve and now he's got something new.
29908,"Look at this one. Spoiled as a child, I'll bet. Allowed to leave trash just lying around..."
29909,Not well I'm afraid. That Brynjolf... he keeps draining the people's pockets with his ridiculous miracle cures.
29911,"He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair."
29915,A devout Nord would rather fall in battle and have his blood spill upon the earth than allow the Empire to strike his name from the divinity.
29916,This is a little creepy.
29918,"He's the protector of Man, the Dragon of the North, the patron of all Nords."
29920,"But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual... and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out."
29921,"If you can't pound the dusk out of your iron, it'll break when it's finished. Hit. It. Harder."
29922,I trust you aren't considering any... thievery.
29924,"And if the meadery is profitable, I get rich. Get the picture?"
29925,May you sword feast on Stormcloak flesh.
29929,Your enemies will soon know the wrath of Sithis.
29930,Changed the linens myself. They're fresh.
29931,Aye. Our Jarl would sure like to know if he did though. Might even pay to find out.
29932,"I guess that wasn't such a big deal elsewhere in the Empire, but here it's caused a lot of resentment. Native son and all that."
29933,Hmm. I don't see anything.
29934,Maven Black-Briar wants me to keep the mead flowing and that's what I aim to do despite all these lazy good-for-nothings that work for us.
29935,"If he could, Savos would float the the entire College above Skyrim, for all the Nords to see."
29937,Again? Didn't we teach you enough of a lesson the first time?
29938,Luckily there's no shortage of Pit bait around here. Now get in there and earn your freedom.
29940,Pardon the mess. We're really trying to do better around here.
29941,"The Skull has been out of touch for so long, I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to feed."
29942,"She's always welcome in Mistveil Keep and between you and me, I'm pretty sure she even has some pretty influential friends within the Empire."
29943,Lady Maven could buy or sell anyone in Skyrim. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one pulling the strings around this city.
29944,Well... yes. There is something. 
29951,He... He gave me something just a little while ago.
29952,"My cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty."
29953,Of course! I'd be more than happy to add a donation to our charity box.
29954,The hospitality of the Thalmor Embassy is at your service.
29957,"You want anything in this life, you gotta take it. Just not from me."
29959,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
29960,Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
29962,I would not have expected a scholar of such an esoteric turn of mind among their ranks.
29964,"Next time one of my shields deflects a killing blow, they'll change their tune."
29967,"I've been ridin' horses since I was a lad... nothin' I liked more. But as I got bigger, so did my mounts."
29968,Been stuck with the name for years.
29970,Mercy!
29971,The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!
29973,"The Jarl has put out a bounty on Forsworn. Here, take a look at this decree for details."
29974,Many I fear still need convincing.
29977,"In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that."
29978,There ain't much more to tell... they're haunted and you should stay away.
29979,But I insist. and with good reason.
29981,Yeah?
29983,I'm not kidding. I'll hurt you!
29988,"You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon."
29989,Thanks again.
29990,I've been adventuring across Tamriel since I was a fresh-faced young woman barely able to swing a blade.
29992,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
29996,I assume you have proof? Can't go making accusations like that without proof.
29998,We want compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
29999,"Dragons, is it? Does that make you the fabled ""Dragonborn"" we've heard mention of?"
30000,Welcome. I'm the owner and proprietor of Honningbrew Meadery.
30001,Bleak Falls Barrow is just outside of town. I can show you.
30002,"Am I responsible if the vintage was off on that case? Sorry, you know the rules Vekel. No refunds."
30003,"I don't know you so we've got nothing to talk about. How about you finish the job Brynjolf gave you, then we can talk."
30005,"In honor of his memory, let me show you a few shield techniques. And tell me if you're leaving town. Be good to travel again."
30006,Last few years have been pretty bad. I've almost closed this place up.
30008,Thanks again for getting my bow back from those thieves. Next time they come knocking I'll be ready.
30010,The Flagon used to be packed every night with the boys from the Guild but now look at it.
30011,"Look, I don't like wasting my time. Come back when you decide to get serious."
30012,"I don't know about the others, but I sure am glad to see a fresh face down here."
30013,"What's to say? I was born on a farm, joined the Legion when I came of age, and I've served you ever since."
30015,"Yes, yes, fine. Just hurry! Mustn't keep the customers thirsty!"
30016,I'm ready.
30018,Let's make the bastards pay.
30019,I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of Whiterun hold.
30020,Just watch your back and do what Mercer says... he'll sort it out.
30021,Word is that you found something while you were out there though... something that could be a problem for the Guild.
30022,Keep it up and you'll go places.
30024,"You and your College have ruined years of my work, I've lost colleagues and friends to the Falmer, and you want me to calm down?"
30026,Maven was down here right before you got back and she was all smiles. Haven't seen her like that in a long time.
30029,Someone should let that cat lose.  That'd shut him up real quick.
30032,"Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it..."
30034,We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.
30036,I'm not sure. I certainly wasn't expecting this.
30038,I'm not afraid of anyone. Put a sword in my hand and I could defend this place if I had to!
30040,A hedge against the forgetfulness of centuries.
30041,"Later, little one. I need to finish what I'm working on. But keep watching. Watch, and learn."
30042,Come back and see us again!
30043,My lateness is due more to getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any desire to actually arrive late.
30044,"I can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before my time, but I still can't believe it."
30045,"We're all behind you, friend. Do your best."
30047,Huh?
30048,We'll speak when the Oath is complete.
30049,"Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content as things keep going our way."
30050,"Doesn't mean anything to me. Got an unusual shine to it, though."
30054,"Their relative positions do not indicate that any individual stone is part of a larger, unobserved pattern."
30059,"Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau."
30060,"Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau."
30061,"Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau."
30065,"Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth."
30067,"Oh, right. That makes sense. Kind of a messy metal, anyway."
30068,"Well... maybe just this once. But there's still a price on your head. Better make yourself scarce, or we'll have to do this little dance again."
30070,Let me see.
30071,"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
30072,"Nivenor, my darling. What a pleasant surprise."
30073,Dah...
30080,"He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge."
30082,He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.
30084,"Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything."
30085,Farengar is probably puttering around in his lab. Day and night. I'm not sure he ever sleeps.
30086,"Save him. Let him perform his rite one more time. And when he does, we will be waiting for him."
30087,It's exhilarating to observe the effects of my potions on the body. Watching the heart stop... the eyes go blind.
30091,"Well, we can always use contributions."
30092,You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out.
30093,"If you can Shout, you need to go see the Greybeards. They'll know what to do."
30095,"You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun."""
30098,I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense.
30099,"Picking on me again, you backbiting Nord? Tired of those prissy nobles turning down your rotten slabs of venison?"
30102,I still can't believe you were able to help Ranmir pull himself together.
30105,You said a whole lot of nonsense about selling Gleda to hire a priestess for some big event.
30108,Just look!
30111,"I have spread rumors of an assassin. It will make your job harder, but will allow me to place blame where I desire it."
30112,"First off, they've got some rebels holed up in a nearby settlement. Need to clean them out so our boys can move in."
30114,"Lads and lasses I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!"
30115,My sister died. Things won't be the same without her.
30116,Strangers like you bring war. I've seen enough war.
30117,"Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again."
30120,You... you have? Already?
30121,You saved Whiterun today. We won't forget.
30123,No shipments have come in.
30125,"Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda."
30126,"Oh, don't listen to him. We can do it, just give us a chance!"
30127,That's all I know.
30128,I want you to speak to the city guard. Make sure there's a contingency plan in effect in case Riften falls under attack.
30129,"I yield. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, the Argonians will be paid as much as any other worker."
30132,Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance. You spoke of her so glowingly.
30135,If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.
30136,You sure about that? You want to let that dragon loose after all the trouble to catch him in there?
30138,Well? Is it done?
30139,I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you where the ceremony will be.
30141,"Perhaps one day, but not today."
30147,Have you found out anything about Alva?
30152,You said you the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.
30155,Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout.
30157,"As high priest of the Nine Divines, I bid you welcome."
30158,Have your weapon at the ready. I'm certain Karliah knows we're here.
30159,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
30161,To maintain relationships.
30163,"As always, lord, your loyalty is a shining example to us all."
30166,We've become aware of a problem in Winterhold.
30167,"It's an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of the Kings is ancient."
30169,Solitude's been the capital of Skyrim as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first.
30170,"Have you been bringing the battle to the Silver Hand, friend? I wish I could be there with you. Soon enough."
30173,"Speak, if you have aught to say worth the listening."
30175,"You can get a room at the Bee and Barb, but mind your coin purse -- it's no secret the Thieves' Guild makes its home here."
30178,Eyes open.
30179,"Some come to buy, but others come to steal. Khajiit shows no mercy to thieves."
30180,What was I thinking? It would never work that first way. Why didn't you tell me?
30181,Laelette! She's dead!
30182,We're taking the city. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
30183,"The amethyst in the center represents The Hist, the entity that all Argonians consider a sacred part of our lives."
30185,"Okay, got it."
30187,Do you want me to hold your hand as well?
30188,"Now, the horse I got for sale is seven years old, but in fine health. She's got a lot of spirit, that one."
30190,No Mulush. I'll work harder.
30191,May song speed you along.
30192,"Another time, or not at all. It's really none of your business, after all."
30196,"You have our gratitude, Arch-Mage."
30197,"Father says I should pick a name that describes what I really am,  but nobody's going to hire Erik Greenthumb or Erik Hoe-pusher."
30200,"Hey, let's talk a second."
30202,Will he cast aside the Imperial coin falling into his coffers? 
30205,I hear there's baked slaughterfish tonight.
30208,No! You will not deny me this!
30210,No! The Eye is mine!
30212,"Ha. We'll see. I do have my eye on her, but she seemed a bit cold when I spoke to her earlier. Maybe just playing hard to get, eh?"
30220,"The Companions? In Jorrvaskr? They're recruiting new members, from what I hear."
30222,"Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my sources... reliable sources."
30224,Tread lightly in the Hall. We don't know what's in there.
30225,Shoot the right target.
30226,He's a wood elf - the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges that we never hear about.
30229,"Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him."
30230,"You really shouldn't be in here, but I guess since it's you..."
30231,To Oblivion with your loot! This ends now!
30232,"Well, looks like you're fitting in well down here."
30234,"Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose something did we?"
30235,You already have someone to do your fighting for you. Don't need me.
30236,"I'm sorry, mother. I can't help it. All that stuff you like to do, it's just so... boring."
30238,Best not go wandering east of the city. Bandits been seen around Broken Helm Hollow. 
30239,What's your trouble? Dasturn telling tales again?
30240,"You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now?"
30242,Revenge? How interesting...
30243,Now we're in for it.
30244,"This way, please."
30246,Proceed down the hall to the gate when you're ready.
30247,"If you wish to talk, I'll be here for a bit."
30248,Mother? Can I talk to you?
30250,"Here, let me teach you a thing or two about Alteration magic. It's the least I can do."
30252,A few hours sleep and we should be ready to continue through.
30256,This should compensate you for your find.
30258,"Well... okay. My father owns the Winking Skeever. But it's the family business, so it'll be mine when he kicks off."
30259,"Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again."
30261,"You know, if you've got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold..."
30264,"It's worth quite a bit actually. Quite a catch! Here you go, this should make you smile."
30267,"Must have come from Mercer's place. He'd admired the Gray Fox for some time. Sure, I'll buy it from you... here you are."
30268,Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?
30269,Yeargh!
30274,The sooner I get out of Skyrim the better.
30276,Here to purchase some armor or a weapon?
30282,"That's all right, grandmother. I like staying home with you."
30287,This one's a favorite of mine. A legend we all know and love...
30288,"Maybe Adelaisa will finally ease up, but I expect she won't."
30289,I... I have some thinking to do. Thank you for this.
30290,"It was my pleasure, Torbjorn. I enjoy cooking, and after what you and Tova have been through, it was the least I could do."
30291,I can assure you that this is entirely false. We are fully in control of everything.
30295,"He ranted at me, how I didn't know what he's been through, how Isabelle broke his heart when she ran off with some thief named Vex..."
30296,There are those that believe the Jarl does nothing for this city... that it's corrupt and run by the Black-Briar family.
30298,"If only my mother would let me, I would make her proud."
30300,Hmph. My family. All that wealth and they squander it on foolish ventures and political schemes.
30302,"Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!"
30303,"It's all thanks to a special technique I developed. I call it the ""Razor-Winged Butterfly."" I'd teach it to you... but then I'd have to kill you."
30304,He was rewarded for his deeds by being joined with the Divines in eternal glory. The only mortal to do so.
30305,"When speaking of the Black-Briars, only one thought should spring to mind. We are not to be trifled with."
30307,The Black-Briars have been instrumental in keeping Riften on the map.
30309,"I've tried everything I can to protect Riften's citizens from her family, but to no avail."
30311,"Maven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the family, represents everything that's wrong with this city."
30313,This is a proper store. Start acting like a proper customer. Sheathe that weapon.
30314,They're shadows of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or their original identities.
30316,"I will make the arrangements, my Jarl."
30317,You must hear the Word within yourself before you can project it into a Thu'um.
30318,It's only a matter of time before Ahtar's blade finds my neck...
30320,"Come on now, old girl."
30323,Master Borri.
30325,Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.
30327,Watch the blades.
30328,My husband Mathias and I tend Corpselight Farm.
30329,"Right now, all that matters is my daughter Mila. No man's going to get between me and my little girl."
30330,They'll never understand. No amount of flowers or honeyed words are going to change my mind.
30334,Nargh!
30335,"Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one."
30337,Not long ago it was my husband Eorlund. There was no finer smith in the nine holds.
30343,Now you're mine!
30344,"They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves. "
30345,I think you and I are going to get along just fine.
30346,Ah! Don't do that.
30347,"I can tell you're new around here, askin' a question like that."
30348,I told you we should have hired a thief.
30349,"You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help."
30350,"I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him."
30351,Always glad to talk to the bard who returned part of the Poetic Edda.
30352,What brings you here?
30353,The Stormcloaks can rot in Oblivion for all I care. I've lived in this city for twenty years. Twenty!
30354,"Why? Because it's old, and full of dead things?"
30356,"By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!"
30359,"You have no authority over me, boy."
30360,Finally. Now get lost.
30364,Whiterun is only a means to an end.
30365,"If you've got some business with Hrongar, mind you stay on his good side. The palace dungeon's filled with folk who roused his temper."
30366,"As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest."
30367,"Balgruuf was an even-tempered man, but his brother's a hot-blooded war-monger who wants to settle everything with a blade."
30368,Got more than you can handle.
30369,Keep my men in your prayers. They'll need them if they don't shape up.
30371,You won't get me!
30373,"Things are tough for him now, I'd wager. What with the fighting, and the dragons. But Balgruuf's a tough old Nord. He can handle it."
30375,"They're scared of the dragons, too, aren't they? Paying too well. They don't know anything."
30377,So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.
30379,Good. I have your invitation to the party.
30380,Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.
30382,"Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood."
30383,I still don't have my Gleda back.
30384,Good to hear.
30388,He is? I'm not sure how to feel about that.  Perhaps it's for the better.
30389,You are not welcome here!
30390,These timber supports are rotted through. It's a wonder this place is still standing.
30395,All that matters is that I have what you need. And it's worth every septim.
30396,Not to mention the benefit of wards! How can they continually overlook wards! It's baffling!
30397,"But on the other, the scarcity of supplies has led to some, well, ""elevated"" prices."
30400,I'm hoping this wife can outlast the winter.
30402,"On the one hand, supplies are harder to come by, since fewer traders are traveling the roads these days."
30403,"Sorry Hemming, I've no interest in becoming your valet."
30404,You're not worth it.
30405,"I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you..."
30406,"Please, do look around. I'm sure I have something you'll want."
30408,I joined up with them maybe ten years ago.
30409,Karthwasten doesn't need outsiders prying in our business.
30410,"Isn't it obvious? Why, the wonderful weather and hospitable people, of course!"
30411,Go away. Now.
30413,"Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way."
30414,How is the pain? Any better?
30416,My previous champion displeases me.
30417,"Could be if one side wants to keep the other from coming across, they might try to knock it down."
30418,Get ready. Trouble ahead.
30419,"Hard to say. It's ancient, that much we know for sure. It was here long before the town itself."
30421,"When I met Michel, I knew this was where I belonged. I suppose that's it, really."
30422,War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that. 
30423,"I grew up an orphan on the streets of Markarth. I'd have died there, too, but for the kindness of an old warrior named Logrolf the Bent."
30430,"And that's not all. They took a heap of our lumber, and one tried to have his way with my daughter. They think they can do whatever they want. "
30432,Name's Nils. I'm the cook up at Candlehearth Hall.
30433,"They stayed at the inn, but didn't pay. They said soldiers don't need to pay because they're risking their lives to protect us."
30434,"Both the Imperials and Stormcloaks have sent riders this way, scouting the bridge and the lands nearby."
30437,Thank you.
30439,"By long tradition, the elder speaks first."
30440,You're a damn fool.
30441,"But... You could take word to her in Solitude, let her know it'll be coming soon."
30443,My blade bit right into the stonework next to the keep and needed serious repairs. Thankfully our smith Balimund works wonders.
30444,"Well, we'd better get back to our rounds."
30445,What are you waiting for? Get in there and find that mask.
30446,"When I was a boy, there was a year we couldn't afford enough feed. So I snuck my dinner out to the stables, and gave it to the horse."
30448,"I generally don't involve myself in politics. Good tales deal with the issues of the day, but a wise bard remains a neutral observer."
30451,"Well then, what are you waiting for? Get in there and earn your pay."
30452,"""When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding"""
30454,"Did you read it yourself? If I recall it correctly, that has some interesting implications. You should mention that to Tolfdir."
30455,"This Elder Scroll might be able to show you the past in some way, then... yes, yes, it could work."
30456,Can't see why we let them dark elves live inside the walls. We should kick 'em out like we did to the scalebacks.
30460,Archers!
30461,"Come on. If someone misses me at the party, we're both dead."
30463,"Is that so? Well, I'll make sure that's taken care of immediately."
30465,The effects have already been felt. The Icerunner has failed to dock on time.
30469,"Properly controlled, it has knowledge enough to turn paupers into kings."
30470,"Brings back memories. Do you have any orders for me, Legate?"
30471,There's a cave here. Think we should check it out?
30472,"Take for example, Ulfric Stormcloak and his little ""rebellion."" But rest assured, his days are numbered."
30474,"The Legion's always been here. Without us to keep order, the provinces would fall into barbarism and lawlessness. Especially Skyrim."
30475,"So, what is the first special ingredient?"
30477,"Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the more the mind can become damaged."
30480,"Now, while I'm certain this is all terribly interesting to you, I have important matters to attend."
30482,"Once I've made enough money trading with the Khajiit caravans, I'm going to buy the Bannered Mare from Hulda."
30483,"Of course she will. She's our daughter, after all."
30484,"He revels in the chase, and also gave the ""gift"" of lycanthropy to mortals."
30485,"Grimsever rests with the Dwemer ruin of Mzinchaleft. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life."
30486,"Ancano has somehow locked himself in the hall. He's up to something, and I intend to put a stop to it."
30490,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
30491,"I trust you, I'm just concerned about her safety. That's all. Don't be angry with me."
30492,"Goodbye, ma'am."
30494,"We're fighting because our own Jarls, once strong, wise men, have become fearful and blind to their people's suffering."
30495,"So, Tythis... you coming by the Bunkhouse later?"
30496,No one's heard from the Psijic Order in so many years. Hard to believe one would just suddenly show up here.
30499,Skyrim being sold to the Thalmor so the Emperor could keep his throne!
30500,In the depths of Blackreach one yet lies.
30501,"""To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies."""
30505,"My days at the College are long behind me, but I prefer to stay close by."
30506,Your Thu'um is no match for mine.
30507,"Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt."
30508,"Die, will you?!"
30509,Ulfric Stromcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.
30511,"For a piece like that, I could pay... 500 gold?"
30515,"You've been exploring places you shouldn't, and you know it."
30516,"He gets the books, I get you. It's very simple."
30518,"I killed Torygg to prove our wretched condition. How is the High King supposed to be the defender of Skyrim, if he can't even defend himself?"
30520,Careful not to torch anything important.
30525,If only you could help bring my son back to me.
30527,"Anuriel, a word please."
30528,"Don't worry, I'll stay right with you."
30530,"But that was precisely the point! He was a puppet-king of the Empire , not a High King of Skyrim."
30531,"True, he didn't stand a chance against me."
30532,Let me tell you how I see it. 
30533,Don't worry. I'll play my part.
30534,"I challenged him in the traditional way, and he accepted. There were many witnesses. No ""murder"" was committed."
30535,"No doubt General Tullius and his friends in the Empire will tell you that I owe them my loyalty, and perhaps I do."
30536,"For too long he's been hand-picked by the Emperor, and given emphatic nods by milk-drinking Jarls addicted to Imperial coin."
30537,What did you just say? All I heard was the sound of jealousy.
30538,But the Moot has not yet met to name her High Queen. And they won't. Not as long as I have any say in it.
30539,"Indeed, Elisif has become Jarl of Solitude, historically and conveniently home of the High King, backed by Imperial interests."
30541,"Clamoring in angry voices, calling out for justice, for war, they sat me on the throne."
30544,"When finally set free, I returned to Windhelm, and was greeted by a city in mourning, at one with my own grief and anger."
30545,"I, his only son, forced to deliver his eulogy via a letter I had smuggled out of prison. Such is the love of Titus Mede for his subjects."
30547,"My father, the great Bear of Eastmarch, died during my imprisonment after the Markarth Incident."
30549,I'll come to your council. But I doubt any good will come of it.
30551,We must have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
30552,"Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but more importantly, it will prove your commitment."
30553,This is your initiation into the coven. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
30554,"Skjor says that I have the strength of Ysgramor, and my brother has his smarts. "
30555,"The mill is my responsibility, and that's what I care about. That's all. Understand?"
30556,Take your question to the College of Winterhold. They may be able to help you.
30559,"Sorry, I have everyone I need at the warehouse. Times are tight."
30563,Alduin mahlaan
30565,Good.
30567,Lady Maven's been developing the secret recipe for Black-Briar Mead over the last several decades.
30568,"Looks like Cicero's not the only only one to go a little crazy from time to time. Eh, Listener? You should talk to Nazir, work this whole mess out."
30569,I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors.
30571,"Yes, well. Perhaps the proprietor of this establishment can assist you. Please, you're starting to... frighten me."
30572,"Now, that's it. One free outfit per soldier. You lose that, or get it banged up, you'll need to pay like everyone else."
30574,There something I can do for you? Perhaps direct you to the nearest prison...
30575,"The longer we travel the roads of Skyrim, the more empty this land seems."
30578,"I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar. What does bring you to me?"
30581,Keep your wits about you and you won't be harmed.
30584,Yep. I have just one question for you.
30586,"Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the ""White-Gold Concordat."""
30587,"Light armor for scouting detail, heavy armor for full on combat, or something in between?"
30590,"Are you alright, Ahlam? You haven't seemed yourself today."
30591,"My scouts have tracked down one of the Forsworn leaders, hiding out in their blood-soaked camps. Deal with them."
30592,(Deep exhale)
30594,What wasn't I clear about?
30595,"I'm sorry, but even Mara's Temple needs coin. We will have a symbol ready for you when you come back with enough gold."
30597,"They don't make finer steel anywhere else. If this doesn't keep you from dying, nothing will."
30598,"I never meant for any of what happened here. Tried to seal it up, lock it away forever."
30602,"My brother and me bought this place when we left the army. Boy, did we lose a bundle, but at least we're not fighting the war!"
30604,I answer the call of the Dragonborn.
30608,"Tell Delvin that if he still desires to have my support for the Thieves Guild in Windhelm, he's got it."
30610,"I need you to pitch in a little more around here, dear."
30611,Follow me. Let's see where this leads.
30612,"At least, that's what we thought until I translated some ancient texts a year or so ago. We now believe King Olaf buried the truth with the bard."
30613,The verse criticized the reigning King Olaf. He was so incensed the bard was put to death and all the copies burned.
30618,I think Giraud here would give you the best explanation of both it and the history of King Olaf's Verse. You should speak to him about it.
30619,You! You're going to hurt me again aren't you? Just stay away.
30621,I must speak to Delphine at once. There's no time to lose.
30622,"Deathbell grow in the frozen tundra. You might nip into a mine for the ruby and silver. Vampire Dust is tricky. Vampires, you know."
30623,"Nuz aan sul, fent alok, fod fin vul dovah nok, fen kos nahlot mahfaeraak ahrk ruz!"
30628,"When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to."
30629,It's... it's like watching an artist create a masterpiece.
30630,"Back, eh? Ready to brawl?"
30631,"You don't invite monsters into your home to have supper! I won't have them here, and I'm certainly not smiling for them!"
30632,"This one would try a shop. You might prefer the direct route, hm?"
30633,"Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?"
30635,"Oh yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade."
30636,"The vapors are waning, but not yet gone. Take a breath. Peryite will speak if He sees fit."
30637,The return certainly seems worth the risk though.
30638,"Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded."
30639,What are we waiting for?
30644,"I just know that our sailors are able to keep their ship quarters clean, and I expect the same of you."
30645,Was that some sort of... healing spell?
30651,"Kreh zini! The freedom of the sky beckons! Yet I stay here, nau gol, as promised."
30653,Did you leave any alive? The Afflicted are mere vessels for my Blessing. It will spread to others through their touch and my own.
30655,But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.
30656,It seems that predators have taken up residence and have been attacking farmers and travelers.
30658,"Ever since you scared off that thug from the Thieves Guild, not one of them's bothered me. We're lucky to have you here."
30659,Then what are you doing here?
30660,"Contemplate the meaning of a Rotmulaag. You will become closer to that Word, as it fills your inner self."
30661,This key opens one of my drop spots in the basement of the meadery. Take anything inside you like.
30662,"Have a drink, rest your feet and stay a little while."
30663,"It's all about sizing up your mark, lass."
30664,"Well... all right. Just because we are friends. Give me, say... 750 gold and we can call it even."
30665,What is this feud you have with your wife? What started this?
30667,"So, the mage needs to be ""taken care of,"" if you understand me."
30668,Ulfric Stormcloak's head on a pike.
30669,Damn outsider. Why couldn't you just mind your own business?
30670,You still here? Go!
30673,Through the inn! Now!
30676,Not so fast Elf!
30677,My blood's calm. I prefer it boiling.
30678,"No, it's fine. I don't mind being poor. "
30679,Get going!
30680,"You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever works for you."
30682, 
30684,Yes. I think I am. You can Shout now. That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.
30686,"According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do."
30687,There's one way to find out. Try to Shout... that would prove it.
30688,This... this is... an outrage...
30689,"We have our wedding soon, don't we? That's right, we do!"
30690,It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this.
30691,"I used to hate it here, but it's not so bad anymore. Constance is real good to us."
30693,I have to work twice as hard because you drink up all our profits.
30694,"Yes, lass? Did you need something?"
30695,"Uh, oh. You ain't gonna hurt me again, are ya?"
30696,"Well, you can Shout now. You couldn't before, right? That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn."
30701,"My father's been haunting me ever since he died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad he's here."
30705,Here you go. This should cover it.
30708,Hmph.
30710,Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.
30711,"Maul, can I ask a personal favor of you?"
30712,I'll be right behind you!
30713,Spells have no effect!
30715,"At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?"
30717,"What are you doing, s'wit?"
30718,"The best. Vittoria's a good woman. Any man should be so lucky. I know my father's not happy about me marrying an Imperial, but that's his problem."
30719,"No one can escape his hunger, here or in the afterlife! Alduin will devour all things and the world will end. Nothing can stop him!"
30720,"I work for Belethor, at the general goods store."
30721,This is... more than I could have hoped for. Have you really done this for me?
30722,It was the only way I could make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
30724,I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.
30727,Let's go on ahead. See if the way is clear.
30728,The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.
30729,I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
30731,"When will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from yours?  Both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end."
30733,Your life is forfeit!
30734,"I often think about High Hrothgar. It's very... disconnected from the troubles down here. But that's why I couldn't stay, and why I couldn't go back."
30740,You will pay for stealing from me you eyeless freak!
30741,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
30742, 
30743,I will take you down too. I am not splitting this horde with anyone.
30744,"Now let's move. I think that was the last of the Silver Hand, but still plenty of draugr for the both of us."
30745,I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands to yourself.
30746,We should keep moving. Still the draugr to worry about.
30747,"""Every door has a key,"" says Vilkas. Sometimes he is wrong, but look around anyway."
30748,All right. What's your fancy?
30751,In dark times friends bring light. This is for you. Thank you for your friendship.
30752,Wizard! Hiding over there by that fence!
30753,"Think the guards will be coming down, soon?"
30755,This looks like the guardian chamber. The key to that door has to be around here somewhere.
30756,Good that you're so eager.
30760,There's no telling what we might find inside!
30761,"Go, seek your fate. I will be watching, and perhaps we will meet again - afterwards."
30762,Ha! You showed those spiders a thing or two!
30764,"Tried making some myself, but I'm no good with the forge and anvil."
30765,"Since Adrianne's death, I've had to buy them from the Khajiit caravans."
30766,"Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable."
30767,I'll hurt you if I have to.
30769,"Anyway, our wares are strong and the prices fair. What else matters?"
30770,"Place is named after her. ""Warmaiden's."" It's a childhood nickname, given by her father. What I hear, she was playing with swords even back then."
30771,"Adrianne. At her forge, just outside."
30775,"If I had a Septim for every case of Rockjoint or Witbane I've cured since I opened this shop, I'd be a rich woman indeed."
30777,"Within these walls, I have all that I need to brew a potion for nearly any ailment."
30778,"I don't need your jokes right now, but maybe you have a point. Maybe Camilla needs some help seeing Sven for what he is."
30779,"He shot an arrow that pierced my... well, my rump. After such a memorable adventure, we knew we had the name for our shop."
30780,"Don't worry, Shadr, your secret is safe with me."
30781,"After our drinks, we went out for a moonlight hunt. We got separated, and in his drunken state my brother mistook me for a deer."
30782,"I can't say I'm happy with your decision. If you change your mind, let me know."
30783,"Yes, I hear that question often."
30784,"He tends the store, and I've got this stall."
30785,"That's why my brother and I opened a shop to sell hunting supplies. It's the Drunken Huntsman, down by the main gate."
30789,It's the peace treaty that ended the war with the Elves of the Aldmeri Dominion.
30793,"One time, I almost cut a finger off sharpening a blade. I hate blood."
30794,"Take care of yourself, and always remember: the world is ripe with people looking to spill your blood..."
30797,"Come in, come in. Too many ears out there."
30799,"Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy..."
30800,"Jarl Brina Merilis is in charge, thanks to the Empire. Best hide any Talos amulets you have."
30801,I'm the hardest worker in Left Hand. Better than any man.
30802,Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
30803,Where have you been?
30806,In your death may you find the honor you lacked in life.
30807,"Fresh-baked loaves, still warm from the oven!"
30808,"Yes, mother. I'm eager to prove my skills today."
30810,Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.
30813,Our tribe has survived this long without you interfering. We'll be fine.
30815,Rrrraaaaarrggghhhh!
30816,"I've already provided you with the key to my museum, what else could you possibly want?"
30817,"Well, if you insist..."
30818,"Shh shh. It's fine, child. It's fine. But we must be cautious, hmm? What we do, the things I teach you. The others wouldn't understand."
30819,But my mind and soul remain my own. I become more than either human or beast. 
30821,"Now, they're nothing more than ruffians and thugs trying to pry a few extra coin from honest people."
30822,I am not! You're lying!
30825,The Ratway's too good of a place for that scum.
30826,They're vermin... garbage. They're exactly what makes this city such a horrible place to live.
30827,Ghorza is the one you should ask if you need anything.
30828,I've heard of them. Something about the men who live in the hills and attack caravans.
30829,All I need is a dozen men and we could march into the Ratway and burn them out like rodents.
30830,You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.
30832,"It's a school that teaches music, poetry, that sort of thing. Most bards in Skyrim have been to the college at some point."
30835,It's strange to think that some of my own ancestors might be buried in here.
30836,"In fact, I wouldn't say they were a threat at all. No, our resources should be spent on preparations for invasion."
30838,I'd hardly call them a Guild. More like unorganized rabble.
30839,"They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place."
30840,My daughter Adara is also my apprentice. She's a quick study.
30843,Stormblade. It's an honor.
30845,"Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?"
30847,It used to be a huge system hundreds of years ago but it fell into decay just like the rest of Riften.
30848,"The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Reach, allowing Jarl Igmund to return to Markarth."
30850,Azura's Star! I knew the Lady of Twilight had sent you for a reason.
30852,It's our name for the old sewers that run under the city.
30853,You need but ask.
30855,Everyone knows the Thieves Guild uses the old sewer system beneath Riften as their hideout.
30856,It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is what you can offer the College.
30858,Disgusting. Ruined sewers filled with goodness knows what.
30860,"7,000 Steps indeed... next time they need to build it closer to the ground..."
30861,"Speak with the Scheming Servant at the Keep in Markarth. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
30865,"Now... now wait a minute. Let's not get hasty. I mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right?"
30867,It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting!
30868,Here's your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
30871,We'd better go make sure that bastard is really dead. Collect us a trophy or something to bring back to Ulfric.
30872,"Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh. "
30873,"I may be dark elf by birth, but I was raised Argonian."
30875,Nothing but foul deeds behind those walls.
30877,Just talk to him; see if you can convince him to give my amulet back.
30880,"Have you seen Mirabelle around? I know she's dead, but I thought... Well, I thought she might stop in and say hello anyway."
30883,"I don't... I know they always disapproved of what I wanted in life, to learn magic instead becoming a farmer, or a hunter."
30884,I've already made it very clear that all of my trades are final.
30886,She'll make a fine wife someday.
30887,Drink Honningbrew Mead with a wench on each arm? Ha ha!
30888,Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path.
30890,I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College.
30893,"It means ""Dwarven Museum."" Lost race of people that built the city."
30894,The Thalmor Justiciars are so often misunderstood. Our primary goal is to preserve the peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.
30895,"Oh, I suppose. But you keep this to yourself; I don't want it being known that I go back on my trades. Understand?"
30897,I suppose the warmth in this place comes from all the hot steam vents.
30898,"Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice."
30899,"What was I thinking? Even if it were true, I'm not setting foot in some ancient tomb, filled with who knows what."
30901,That's abominable. Barbaric. I'll have no part of this. Why didn't you tell me what you intended?
30902,"No, no. You're not understanding this."
30903,For the privilege of entering the city. What does it matter?
30905,Can't wait to gut one of those rebels.
30906,All right. I'll tell you a little story.
30907,This place must be cleansed. These draugr were once living beings and they deserve better.
30912,Let's pretend for a moment that a certain individual was looking to acquire a particular staff.
30914,"Look, I traded a staff to someone and found out later that was a bad idea. So, I'd like the staff back. Understand now?"
30919,Regardless. It appears Skyrim must stand alone. Again.
30922,And so we meet again. But this time I know who and what you really are.
30924,Talos preserve us.
30925,"I swear, if one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to burn my mill to the ground!"
30926,Did you have some sort of official business here?
30929,It's an entirely different situation. I don't expect you to comprehend the nuances of these matters.
30930,"Never mind, I'm dead already-"
30933,Yeah.
30934,"Oh, a new pamphlet from Dinya? I'll be glad to read it. Thanks."
30935,Hmph.
30936,"I look forward to having it back soon. The sooner, the better, in fact."
30937,"Like I told you, last time I saw her she was headed for Hobs Fall Cave. No idea what happened to her."
30938,"Here's your gold, as promised."
30940,"I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant."
30942,Pleasure doing business with you.
30943,"Oh... Oh no... Please, please... I ain't never harmed no one... Old Narfi just wants to be left alone..."
30944,"Drem. Patience. There are formalities which must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dov."
30946,Yeah. So?
30947,The old traditions are passed down from one generation to the next. The secrets of smithing are passed down as well.
30952,Ha! I didn't think he'd really give it back.
30958,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Falkreath.
30959,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Dawnstar.
30960,Can't tell you. It's a bit of a trade secret I picked up when I was living in High Rock.
30961,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Windhelm.
30962,"Die, beast!"
30964,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Markarth.
30967,What a sight....
30968,"Delvin, that last shipment we heisted on the Cyrodiil frontier was worthless!"
30970,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Riften.
30971,"I hear one of them, Nelacar, still hangs around the Frozen Hearth. Guess he has no where else to go, poor thing."
30972,It's not the friendliest place for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in a slum called the Gray Quarter.
30975,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Solitude.
30976,Then leave.
30981,What's that supposed to mean?
30985,I'll gladly kill you myself!
30986,I run the forge now. Kind of... scary.
30987,There's another report of a disturbance in this Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
30988,I do hope you still have the Staff of Magnus someplace. I suspect you're going to need it.
30989,Am I to take your silence as acceptance?
30992,"Perhaps from Sovngarde, the heroes of old can join me in their rescue. The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such triumph."
30993,No? Then how do you like the idea of having your legs broken?
30995,"We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support."
30996,I can't fight. Not even a little bit. My family thinks I'm a little milk drinker.
30997,Brother Umurn is a strong warrior. I look forward to fighting him for chiefdom one day.
30999,"If I were you, I'd keep away from the barrow on the east side of town... it's haunted."
31000,"It would seem there's some sort of disturbance. From what few details we were given, it sounds quite familiar."
31001,Your insults and provocations have gone far enough!
31003,Pleased enough to justify the significant amount of gold offered to the College to rectify the problem.
31004,Very good. I'm sure the Jarl will be quite pleased.
31006,"Did you do everything I said, Shadr?"
31008,Are you going to walk over to father and start hitting him again?
31010,"Lately, they've been threatening to send my whole family into exile if we're caught collaborating with the Empire. They think we're spies!"
31011,Do you see that?
31013,Some kind of resonance... you and the wall. It must be connected to the amulet!
31014,"We shouldn't have been disturbing Saarthal, no matter what you found down there."
31015,Clavicus sent you didn't he?
31016,Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.
31017,The Words wait.
31018,Have you killed them all yet?
31019,Follow me. I will show you how to open the path to Paarthurnax.
31020,"Forget Solitude or Windhelm. Whiterun was the crown jewel of Skyrim before... Well, before... Never mind."
31021,I can't talk right now.
31023,"I hope to open my own stables one day, but I think it's going to take a lot longer than I expected."
31024,Don't even bother with that one. Leave it to the orcs.
31026,"Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what's known as the Nightingale Trinity."
31028,"You've been at it for five minutes. Here, let me try."
31030,"It's really dead, then?"
31031,You thought what? You would skip a step? Not heat the metal all the way through? Useless! Now do it again.
31032,This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt!
31033,"Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us."
31035,"I borrowed some gold from Sapphire to pay for the shipment, but it got robbed before it even arrived."
31036,I was able to work out a deal with the stables in Whiterun to sell me some of their tack and harnesses.
31039,"True... But qostiid - prophecy - tells what may be, not what should be."
31040,I... Willl... kill you!
31042,A little push and this would all be simpler.
31043,"They were golden, even when they were dead. But their blood was red. I knew it would be."
31044,"Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Sorry, pup, but I'm not quite in the mood."
31046,I hope we don't run into anything worse than Imperials in here.
31048, 
31052,Hmm. I don't want to get involved in anything beneath my dignity as Jarl.
31053,"Hakon! A glorious day, is it not!"
31055,"Should they accept her rule, we will have peace."
31060,Good man.
31062,"Sister, how is my fortune coming along?"
31063,"And if you're just looking to feel good, go get some Spiced Wine from Evette. But whatever you do, just leave me alone."
31064,"Agreed, we can't afford to try again."
31065,No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...
31066,I can smell the blood. Good and sour.
31067,"For the first time in a long while, I truly believe that there are brighter days ahead."
31068,"So you're the... the assassin? I need you to kill the Visiting Noble at Dragonsreach, in Whiterun. Here's the gold. I... I hope it's enough."
31069,What a delightful find! This should cover it.
31070,"Soon enough I'll have you back under the headsman's axe, and this time there won't be any dragon to save you."
31071,I bet the wedding was amazing... and we missed the whole thing.
31072,Big swords should always beat little swords. 
31073,"You make one move towards my skooma, and I shiv you."
31074,"I just need to hire one, maybe two good men. You won't starve."
31075,You will be my blood offering to Morvath!
31076,Brynjolf's been sending idiots like you down here for years looking for their hideout.
31078,You honor Khajiit with your presence.
31079,Where are my goods? Did the shipment come in?
31080,Help me! A vampire!
31084,My eyes inside Cidhna Mine tell me that Madanach is dead.
31085,"Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm certain Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own."
31086,Another victim fell for our ruse!
31087,Morvath will taste your blood!
31091,"I thought I was a goner just now. Thanks for the help, and if you need any supplies I have a few to sell."
31093,Maramal thinks he's so smart; tells me that Mara will cleanse the filth from my blood. Ha! What does he know?
31095,Keep droppin' these jobs and I might quit assignin' them to you.
31096,Miss Grelod is... well she's a terrible old crone. No person could be that cruel. I think she's part hagraven.
31097,And who is this?
31098,A group of them has holed up in the Rift.
31099,"It is no matter, this fool will be the next act of the show."
31101,I know I did. But how was I to know the shipment would get robbed?
31102,"Next time, keep your plans quieter and nothing would have happened to it."
31103,What? Are you telling me you robbed it? Why? Why are you doing this to me?
31104,Haven't heard from him in a long while. 
31105,"I can grant you a powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of Dwemer make, capable of shielding you from both the spell and sword."
31106,"To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time."
31107,"The job pays well, so I hope I can make arrangements soon. We could really use the gold."
31108,The pettiness of mortals. I had almost forgotten.
31109,Hey! Don't get mad and hurt me again.
31112,"Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate."
31114,"Well done, brother. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement."
31116,That wasn't what I meant.
31117,What? What are you looking at?
31118,"When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to."
31121,"Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the Afflicted, contains the festering wound."
31122,I'm going to tell father you said that. He'll tan your hide for sure!
31123,"Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west, at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz."
31125,"If it's about the Hall of the Dead, no, you can't go in there."
31126,"""Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!"""
31127,"I'll go after you. Although these fellows know me. I never miss one of Elenwen's parties, you see."
31128,Sure.
31131,"Proventus, you must help me. We need to convince my brother to do more for the war effort."
31132,"Hey, can I get a gold or two?"
31133,Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the job. I'm sure you understand.
31134,More of those things. Bah. Viola Giordano's been putting them all around the city.
31135,I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.
31136,"Because they don't care about you or I, cub. They think they're better than all of us, and that we can just be thrown away."
31137,"Hey, shouldn't you tell the Temple of Mara that we're getting married? Be hard to have a wedding without a priest."
31138,Enjoying your newfound abilities I trust?
31139,"I'm not asking you to defy the Jarl, just to open his eyes."
31141,Maybe you'd like a taste?
31143,"You own Proudspire Manor, hmm? Beautiful house. At least from the outside."
31144,"Leave me out of your intrigues, Hrongar. If you have something to say to the Jarl, say it with you own tongue."
31145,"Father promised me a new dress days ago, now where is it?"
31146,Oh... hello there. Didn't notice you come up. I was focusing my magicka.
31148,"Goodbye, assassin."
31151,"It takes a while to make a dress, Dagny. You have to be patient."
31154,"Ah, yes. Rented the nicest room we had for a whole month."
31156,Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day!
31159,"Next thing you know, there'll be more guards, and then we'll lose our homes as well. This is just the start of it, mark my words."
31162,All right. Take this and get out of here.
31163,I'm endin' you right now!
31165,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
31166,"My husband owns it, barely. He'll lose it soon enough. He's behind on his loan payments, but he drinks all his money away just the same."
31167,Alduin mahlaan
31169,"Damn right it has. Demand's never been so high, at least not since I built the new mill."
31170,You think a few miles can truly keep us apart?
31171,"I think I would, if it weren't for my son. And my wife."
31172,"Hmm? Oh, yes."
31173,"He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also going to dump it into the brewing vat."
31174,Heeya!
31175,"He had your soft face, and that silly grin you get when you've done something wrong. That's his, too."
31176,"In fact, the Mages Guild was founded in opposition to the idea of the Psijic Order, that only an elite few should have control over magic."
31177,When you're able to draw a bow all the way to your shoulder.
31178,"The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords."
31180,No. Can't say there was. My parents died when I was young. You and the Legion have been my only family since.
31181,"There's still Imperial camps to be cleaned up, as you know. And that takes arms and armor."
31183,Your choice.
31184,"Keep looking, Unblooded. There's got to be some way to get that thing open."
31185,"These days, we have more people like you coming in, looking for healing and the like."
31192,"My brothers, we have been here long enough. It's time to leave Cidhna Mine and continue our fight against the Nords."
31195,"Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan, Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal!"
31196,"Wow. Yeah. That sounds great, mother. Only, um... it's just that..."
31197,"Not many people care, these days. The world is the worse for it."
31199,"By the gods, I feel like I could crush a giant's head like a walnut."
31202,"If I were walking around with a wound, I would want you to tell me to see a doctor."
31203,What? What is this?
31204,"Don't be late, you don't want to miss your own wedding!"
31205,"Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on, friend."
31206,We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?
31207,"First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice."
31209,"It's not an insult, just an observation."
31210,"No he isn't! He's the enemy, and we are going to crush him."
31212,"Being friends with the bartender's son has its advantages, huh?"
31214,"And between you and me? He wasn't even that good a king. All of those rambling speeches about the Empire this, and the Empire that..."
31215,"Fine! I'll just... leave the rest of it. Let's go, then, if you're in such a hurry."
31218,Krif krin. Pruzah!
31222,"If you want to go out to Whiterun and burn that meadery down, go right ahead."
31224,Men who understand each other often have no need for words.
31228,There will be a feast in our honor when we return.
31232,"The power to unmake the world at my fingertips, and you think you can do anything about it?"
31235,"And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?"
31236,I was beginning to lose faith that any help would come.
31237,"And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing."
31238,"We aren't a big city like Solitude or Markarth, but we like it this way."
31240,Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.
31244,"He's a traitor, plain and simple. Had I been sitting on the throne, he'd be hanging from the gallows for his sympathies towards the Empire."
31245,"Come on, you monster!"
31247,"She wouldn't have to be there at all, if it weren't for Roggvir."
31248,Hello. I'm Gisli. But you can just call me Erikur's sister. Everyone does.
31251,"Be wary what you say around here, friend. You'll find not all take kindly to ""insurrection."""
31252,"Dangerous post, Dawnstar. If the bandits don't get you, the animals will."
31254,"His cause may be true, but the man is a lie... all he holds in his heart his lust for the throne."
31255,They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.
31256,I'm not so sure the few guards they've assigned to the farm are enough.
31257,Have you mastered the Expert level destruction spells yet?
31258,He's begun a rebellion against those that wish to eradicate the worship of Talos and uses it as his rallying cry.
31259,Ulfric only cares about one thing... Ulfric. He's ordained himself the future High King of Skyrim and steps on anyone that gets in his way.
31261,"I see. Well, let me know if things get out of hand."
31263,You should have listened. Guards! Help! Trespasser!
31264,Exactly as I said it would. 
31266,"You're always talking about the Forsworn. You aren't thinking of joining them, are you?"
31267,"I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame."
31268,This will be worth it.
31269,"Please, get me out of here!"
31272,I can certainly share a bit of what I know.
31274,Well I really would like to make sure I've corrected what happened last time.
31275,"I mean, it would take months... years to work out the differentials. But what a revolutionary concept."
31279,I need your help with something. Something private.
31281,"I'll be the judge of that. Now, back to your practice."
31284,"When you're hungry, you'll look anywhere for food. Can't blame him."
31286,"Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau."
31288,"I try to keep Grimvar safe, but these are dangerous times."
31289,I hope to get into the Bards College one day.
31290,Unf!
31294,"I hope you're enjoying the music, ma'am."
31295,"...need to sharpen my blade... make it shiny, gleamy, and oh so deadly..."
31296,"I'm sorry, but I really can't."
31298,Well. Anything to relieve the boredom. As long as it doesn't get back to me.
31300,"Sorry, but you'll have to find someone else to help you with your prank."
31303,You can tell it because it has lots of ebony.
31304,We've got to bring it down!
31307,"I will kill this jester if you so desire, but there is a disturbance in the Void. Our Dread Father does not wish this."
31308,"I advise Igmund the same way I advised his father. Caution, caution, caution."
31309,Traditionally it's carried by the court mage.
31311,Husband. Let him tell his story.
31313,"Come, follow me."
31314,He said I stole something! Me! Poor Cicero. A common thief. The very thought is insulting. One might even say... maddening.
31316,Delvin and Vex have been running things for now.
31317,"If you've got an axe, you can always make gold chopping wood. Just bring me everything you cut."
31318,"Watch that tongue, new blood."
31319,This place is worthy of some time. You go on ahead. I'll see you back there.
31320,"Oh, thank you! Divines bless your kind heart."
31321,Over here! Hurry!
31322,Yes? What is it?
31325,Leave me alone.
31326,What are you looking at?
31328,Now we can get back to work. Thank you.
31329,We promised a group of Nord militia free worship in exchange for their help retaking the Hold. Then the Elves found out about it.
31330,"Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?"
31331,"Well, as this is the first time this has happened, I'll make it very clear that the College does not condone that sort of behavior."
31333,The Imperials have really dug into Whiterun. We'll wrest it from them soon enough. We must. Its central position is key.
31334,"Yes, father, I did. And I watered her, and got fresh feed, and refitted the old saddle, just like you asked. Is there anything else?"
31335,"You've already done us a service in stopping the binding, but I need you to go talk to him, to see if Styrr can tell us what to do next."
31336,I don't want to do this!
31337,"If we lose half our men, the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves' Guild will have the run of the city. The Stormcloaks will be the least of our worries!"
31339,Have you lost all sense? We are short on guards as it is!
31340,"Very. I helped raise him. Oh, I could not have been more proud to see Torygg on the throne. He made a fine king. A fine king..."
31342,I like to think I've aged well. I'm certainly wiser than I once was. And I know when one should speak... and when one should hold their tongue.
31344,"I was, to my shame. The whole court was in attendance. I've seen much in my time, but that was a gruesome day."
31345,"There may be a way to bypass the barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done."
31347,"Torygg's father Istlod had held Skyrim together for nearly twenty-five years. When he died, Torygg became that symbol."
31350,"Yes, can I help you with something?"
31351,We thought he was here to ask Torygg to declare independence. By the time we realized Ulfric was here to challenge Torygg... it was already too late.
31352,Ulfric showed up at the gates of Solitude requesting an audience.
31356,You'd do well to remember that the next time you make such a stupid observation.
31357,Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?
31358,Is this your best effort? Again.
31359,"But Ulfric was at that moot, continually talking about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason."
31360,"Of course, without functioning mills, who will make the arrows for our soldiers? Men have no sense of irony."
31361,"Are you daft? This isn't the Dark Brotherhood! We don't go around murdering anyone, ever. It just isn't how things are done."
31366,Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.
31367,"If you're looking to pass the time, you can give Calixto a few septims and gawk at whater oddity he's come across lately."
31368,"I was making my way down the road from Ivarstead towards Riften, and I saw Vex fighting off a couple of wolves."
31369,"The patrols never seem to give us time to be alone, the nosy pests."
31370,Because the food and resources we get from the Empire are important to our people.
31371,Because the Dominion is a sleeping beast that Skyrim cannot slay alone. Because many Nords are part of the Imperial army even now.
31372,The Emperor's cousin Vittoria Vici is getting married soon. The reception will be public - anyone in Solitude can attend.
31377,"When Ulfric's lips parted, when he unleashed the power of the Thu'um... That Shout, that ancient and terrible tongue... ripped Torygg asunder."
31379,"Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day."
31380,Keep your hands to yourself.
31381,"I think it was Margret. Poor woman, she was just visiting the city from Cyrodiil."
31382,"Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King."
31384,Varnius Junius stopped by here on his way to court. He was worried about something. I'm sure Falk Firebeard could tell you what.
31385,"At times. Jaree-Ra stopped by the other day. Told me to keep an eye out for him, see if any new people arrived in the city."
31387,"He was very nervous, mentioned something about needing help."
31388,"That I do. I had a messenger from Dragon Bridge stop here on his way to the Blue Palace, not too long ago."
31389,"Pleasant weather for a war, no?"
31393,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
31394,"The bards give out spiced wine during the festival, so they put in a big order. And then, for weeks after, demand is so high, I can barely keep up."
31399,"Pa says I'm too young to fight in the war, but I can still help by patrolling the town."
31402,"Svari, yes. It's been hard on her. The girl misses her uncle."
31404,He looks so... sweet. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
31406,"Know about them? Lass, you're looking at them."
31407,No one in the Jarl's court is above the charge of conspiring against the city. You're coming with us.
31408,You have been a worthy tool. Fill the world with destruction in my name.
31410,"Of course, not as many pilgrims these days."
31411,And? Were they magnificent?
31412,I've seen you helping the Jarl. If only all visitors to Whiterun were as noble.
31414,There's an old maid's tale that says our ancestors dug these mines with their bare hands.
31415,"Drink up, my boy! Drink to those who have fallen! May their souls find their way to Sovngarde!"
31416,"What's new with the Cruel-Seas, Suvaris? Have they given you one of those helmets with the horns on them yet?"
31417,"Soon, all Nords will be thralls to the Thalmor!"
31418,"Our secret ingredient, if you will. "
31421,"Still, you are a good friend to J'zargo now, for taking this risk. J'zargo thanks you."
31422,But you were not placed in harm's way on purpose.
31423,"This was not the intention, to be sure. It is true that J'zargo was slightly concerned there may have been... problems."
31425,Oh. J'zargo takes this to mean it did not go... well.
31429,Heard there were wolves on the road up north.
31431,"At least, when we can get shipments to her. We're late on the last one. I expect her to start breathin' fire any moment now."
31433,"Then come for me, ""daughter of Skyrim."" Come for me!"
31434,"Tell me you've seen them. Those... things. Small and evil, like something out of a nightmare. They come from Stillborn Cave, to the north. I know it."
31435,"If you have a moment, could you help me with something?"
31436,I still need someone to practice a few spells on. Interested?
31437,"We're all trying to become better mages, right?"
31439,"Good luck, brother. I'll see you later."
31441,Good on you.
31447,Here for work? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop.
31448,"Look at this craftsmanship! These old halls fill some folk with dread, but as a Nord, they fill me with pride."
31450,"Now, you just stand there..."
31451,Thank you. I was afraid I'd have to figure out some way to do this on my own.
31452,"Lead on, we're ready."
31453,"Now, you just stand there..."
31454,"Ebony armor. By Ysmir, 'tis a wondrous sight. "
31456,Must you bother me now? I've almost figured out where it is.
31457,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
31458,"Now, you just stand there..."
31461,We need to find that burial mound before its dragon comes back to life.
31463,"All I need is someone to deliver it for me. If anyone saw me leave Riften, they'd get suspicious."
31464,"Not now, please. I'm just... too upset to talk."
31465,"Last I'd heard, he'd been carted off to Northwatch Keep. Ever heard of it?"
31467,"Ha, what a coward. Didn't even put up a proper fight."
31469,"There! Now, I..."
31472,"Do you... do you feel all right? You look very, umm, green."
31473,Oh my. That isn't right!
31475,There! All better.
31476,Time for you to die!
31483,"I've sent men to scout out the area. You are to meet them, find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort."
31488,"Yes, that's your mother's side of the family talking. Just stay on for one more season, that's all I ask."
31489,It's a blessing given to the most honored of the Companions.
31490,"I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence."
31491,"Or if you're looking for training, we've got plenty of it down here. Delvin, Vex, Niruin and Vipir can give you a leg up on that."
31492,"Ah. No, that was not supposed to happen."
31493,And just what do you think you're doing?
31494,Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!
31495,"It is good that you were willing to help J'zargo. This will not be forgotten, friend."
31496,"It is true, J'zargo suspected there might be problems. But this is most disappointing."
31500,But someone keeps taking them down.
31501,"My wife's a good woman. She can be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I love her just the same."
31504,"And when you are, we can try this again and I'll be sure to get it right."
31505,"Ah, Thonar, don't you worry. Nana Ildene isn't going anywhere."
31506,That must have been quite a surprise.
31507,It's not!
31508,"Take care of yourself, Orgnar. Goodbye."
31510,"In the meantime, I'll see about figuring out what went wrong."
31512,That someone would attack Jorrvaskr... it's unthinkable.
31513,It pleases me to see you again.
31514,You! Fetcher! I should kill you for assaulting my family. But I will accept your apology...
31517,So you're just one of Aren's lackeys? That's disappointing. You show real promise.
31518,I'm not really sure. I think it's just a minor miscalculation on my part.
31519,Horkers' revenge!
31521,"He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer."
31524,Ri'saad is the head of a small syndicate of independent merchant families.
31525,"I'm just out and about, love. The Bannered Mare can do without me for a bit, I suspect."
31527,"My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back."
31528,Do not allow Ataxia to fester. A smart warrior keeps a potion to cure diseases at all times.
31529,Are you completely insane? Swallow a soul gem?
31532,Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
31535,"The boy was good at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role."
31536,"If you can locate the quill and return it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider the debt satisfied."
31537,Dovahkiin! No!!
31539,"Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels."
31540,The wizards called it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous amount of gold to have it made.
31541,It's only because I've had an excellent teacher.
31544,"I'm sure you can understand how useful that would prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were involved."
31545,"If there's anything you wish to purchase, just let me know."
31546,They may be able to tell you something about the Elder Scroll you seek.
31547,"Here, take this Grand Soul Gem, fill it for me, and bring it right back. I'll be waiting."
31548,They will sing stories of this day.
31549,"Delphine? How do you... so you've finally found her, and she led you to me. And here I am, caught like a rat in a trap."
31550,Private quarters are strictly off limits. You have been warned.
31551,"Excellent. And now, please accept this token of appreciation."
31552,"Go ahead, hit me as often as you want. It's not going to change anything, other than to make me and the town guard angry."
31554,And you're worried about your shoes?
31555,"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
31556,Go ahead and call this dragon of yours. We're ready.
31557,"So if you're getting any ideas about selling it to someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value."
31558,What about them?
31559,Oh! You startled me. I wasn't expecting company out here.
31560,The Legion could sure use someone like you. Good luck.
31561,"There were many good battles, friend. I miss those days."
31563,It's really great we're friends. I was hoping to find some way to thank you. I hope this does the trick.
31565,M'aiq has heard it is dangerous to be your friend.
31572,"I'd give a week's pay to see the look on Ulfric's face again, when he had to swallow the terms of the truce."
31573,"Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again."
31574,Ignore the talk of spirits and creatures and such. It's just superstition.
31575,"I bet your family would be amazed, right?"
31576,Really? I wrote that off a long time ago.
31578,"Oh come on, I ain't that dumb."
31579,Because I'm telling you to.
31580,How do you think we should spend the remainder of our classroom time?
31583,"Come on, we need to show the journal to the Guild."
31586,"Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that madman."
31587,It is said that an Orc first learns to wield a hammer in her mother's womb.
31588,Hang on Mercer! I'm coming to help!
31590,"And none of the waiters will bring me a drink. Elenwen must have told them to cut me off, the frigid bitch."
31591,Ha ha! That's funny. Ya' think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight.
31592,Just leave.
31593,"I want to beg his forgiveness. Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free."
31594,"You did something for me, I'm gonna do something for ya'. Here, take the key to Mercer's house. Won't need it any more."
31596,"I don't know how ya' talked Maven into letting me go, and I don't care."
31597,Good. Here's what you need to do.
31600,Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got.
31601,"Stand fast! His strength is failing! Once more, and his might will be broken!"
31602,"Not that I'd ever get involved in any of those kinds of things, of course."
31606,"By Ysmir, this is just what we need. There'll be panic in the streets if this proves true."
31608,An old woman can get away with almost anything.
31612,Been up to the Blue Palace? It's a sight to see. Even if it is filled with fops...
31614,"I hate it here. Those were my favorite shoes, ruined and for what? We never even made it to the wedding."
31615,I don't go down easy if you raise your hand against me again.
31616,"Wha... Your shoes? We get robbed by bandits, my clothes torn to shreds by some giant cat, our bodyguard eaten by a dragon..."
31617,"When we get back to Cyrodiil, I swear I will hire an army of battlemages to come up here and set fire to the whole damned province."
31618,I am Keeper of the Vigil here in Skyrim. We bring Stendarr's Mercy to the innocent and His Justice to the Daedra.
31619,"If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir. I'm afraid I'm in too much trouble to help you."
31620,Tell me as soon as you've given Camilla the letter.
31622,Just get away from me. We've got nothing left to steal.
31624,I hate this place. I hate the trees. I hate the rocks. And I hate the snow.
31625,Ugh. It's talking to me.
31627,"The way things have been going around here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch."
31631,"Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper."
31632,His head will be sent to Cyrodiil where it will adorn a spike on the walls of the Imperial City. 
31634,"Yes, that's right.  Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine."
31639,It's been brought to my attention that the poison known as skooma may be present in our city. What do you know of this?
31645,Even my claws feel sharper.
31646,"Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lass?"
31648,"The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid."
31649,"And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men."
31650,"From the time she's a little girl to the moment she expires, she is a direct connection with the heavenly mother. "
31651,"With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts."
31653,But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?
31656,"Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could."
31657,You have much to learn... But you have proven your will is strong and your heart is devoid of pity.
31660,"We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend."
31662,"Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see."
31664,Ruki? Where is she?
31665,Lead on. I'm behind you.
31666,Master Einarth is waiting.
31669,"Aringoth said as soon as the deed goes through, we're done here. Then we'll head south and look for more work. Deal?"
31671,Defense? No one would dare attack Riften. I'm not sure you realize just how well connected Jarl Maven is with the Empire. 
31672,Secret? What makes you think there's a secret?
31674,No! Noooooo!
31676,Hmm. The Rift would help secure our communications with Cyrodiil... and threaten Ulfric's southern flank...
31679,"Sure, I don't mind taking some more of your gold."
31680,Whatever happened to Ennodius? He just up and left.
31681,"Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere."
31682,The Synod's harsh rules and draconian structure are maintained only by suppressing any opposition to their Council's policies.
31683,This one's claws are ready for you should you assault me again.
31685,You... what? How could you possibly...
31687,"Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people."
31688,"Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You know, make sure they're generally following orders."
31690,Be careful. This woman is known to be dangerous.
31692,I'm just itching for a fight.
31695,I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.
31696,I'd be a fool to turn down a chance of marrying you. I'm game if you're game!
31697,"Nonsense. If Balgruuf falls, someone will take his place, for better or worse. In the meantime, we have a war to win. And win we must."
31698,"I've been looking for an Amulet of Arkay to remind my wife that our child is with the gods now, but I can't find one."
31701,"Damn it, woman, I'm the Jarl of Whiterun! I won't apologize for talking to my people. You can't protect me every moment of the day."
31702,"Oh yes, it is Cicero! You were a fool to spare me. What, did you think I would be grateful? Cicero should be Listener! Not you! Now you will die!"
31704,"My lord, our provisions are running dangerously low. Our stores of meat, wine and grain are all but depleted."
31705,"My lord, since Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising, the cost of goods has doubled. I'll need more coin if I'm to provision us properly."
31706,"Our coffers are nearly empty. I can scarcely afford to pay the guards, and we need every one of them in these troubled times."
31708,"Let them come! I have no fear, for Talos is my ally and I am his prophet. His word is upon my lips, his voice in my throat."
31709,"We work hard, try to do right by our families."
31710,"Not now. The Underforge, tonight."
31711,"I want you to go to that ruin, find Alain Dufont, and kill him. I don't care about his friends. Do whatever you want with them. But Alain has to die!"
31712,It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the Dwemer abomination and make my way to the surface.
31713,"I mean, I've... taken care of many people for her in the past. What in Oblivion did she expect me to do?"
31714,I didn't know it when we were... with each other... but Alain is actually the leader of a band of cutthroats. Bandits.
31718,"I'm not playing with you, Kayd! You play mean!"
31719,What's this?
31720,Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.
31721,My son is dead! At his own wedding! Only those Imperial dogs would have dared do something like this! Damn them all to Oblivion!
31722,"Eltrys, yes, just last season we were wed."
31723,"If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal."
31725,"I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name."
31726,"All right, I understand. I'll do it tomorrow, okay? Just get off my back."
31730,You Nords and your bloody sense of honor.
31732,"Thank you for coming to dinner, Hogni."
31735,"My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You know, a... a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life. "
31736,You cannot eat Gleda! Gleda is protected by Grok!
31737,This one's locked. Let's see about that gate.
31738,Don't kill me.... I don't want to die!
31741,"Unless you've come to pay a ransom, turn around and walk away."
31743,"I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer. Not a... a great wanderer, like you."
31744,"Ah, there you are."
31745,I hope you've readied yourself.
31746,Just shut up and play the game.
31747,...the Emperor.
31749,"And guess who owns the Silver-Blood Inn? Not that we named it that, the people just insisted."
31750,"My dear vagrant, we're the only family worth knowing in Markarth. We own everything in this city, even the jail."
31752,I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before.
31753,"Yes, my Thane?"
31754,"There ain't much to offer, but if you wanna place dry to spend the night, I'll rent you a room."
31755,I'm still trying to figure out why Skjor let you in in the first place. 
31756,"Yes. But understand - during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons were his allies. There was nothing else they could be."
31758,I've converted the classic tale of Eyldi the Bear to be performed with drums. I think you'll be impressed!
31759,High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world.
31760,"Whichever it is, I don't like it."
31761,No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.
31762,"Yes, my lord."
31763,Something is wrong. There is an intruder.
31765,"Thank you. Here, I was going to bring this to my sister, but I think you should have it."
31766,Have you seen my mother? I'm still waiting for her to come home.
31767,"Yes. They chose me when I was just a lad. It was a great honor, of course. I was to become a Greybeard myself."
31770,<humming>
31771,"I've spent the last few decades living in regret and seeking redemption from Mara. And by Her Benevolence, I will right my wrongs."
31772,"Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon."
31773,"Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called ""The Dreamstride""; using dreams to travel distances in the real world."
31775,"Now let's, um, not talk about this anymore. Okay?"
31777,You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.
31779,"Yes. The oldest and most powerful, although he may not seem so."
31781,"I have... fallen from their strict teaching, but I still don't feel it should be used lightly. Not all of Arngeir's lecturing was wasted, it seems."
31783,"Either way, this is the end of it. "
31785,"You'll have to make your own decision. It's a beautiful philosophy, but outside the seclusion of High Hrothgar, I was never able to hold to it."
31787,Oh! Miss Maven. What can I do for you?
31788,"Unmid, I wish to travel about the city. Prepare an escort please."
31789,They always hope to teach the Dragonborn to respect the Way of the Voice as they do. They never fully succeed.
31792,"I miss her, too, but I'm glad she's safe."
31794,"You're Dragonborn. The rules don't apply to you. You can Shout the way dragons do... without training, through inborn instinct."
31799,Is it just me or is it getting saner and saner these days?
31800,I studied with them when I was young. They taught me how to Shout.
31801,"I don't know how, but he lives. I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question."
31802,"Oh, just look at you. Absolutely brilliant. Now... now you're just as I imagined."
31804,I hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.
31808,"Bucket. Knife. Book. Inkpot. Stone. No, no, no."
31809,"By Shor, you're hauling around a lot of junk. Best stop in at the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, sell it off."
31812,The Imperials are here in force. Stick together.
31813,Some gate guard you were!
31814,I am wise woman to this stronghold.
31817,I knew I could count on you.
31823,"It's okay, I know what happened at home. With the dragon and all."
31826,My scouts tell me the inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
31827,"Oho! And what do you want, hmm?"
31828,Malacath protect you.
31830,Its name is no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.
31833,The Jarl and I have our disagreements. Sorry if you had to overhear one of them.
31836,"All the wood furniture in this inn is rotting to the core. Do you know why that is, Kleppr?"
31837,"Observing and capturing the epic struggle for Skyrim! When brothers clash with bitter blades, surely there is a song to be found."
31838,We just take what will not be missed. What no one needs anymore. Maybe we take some weapons and stop a few deaths. Who would call that thievery?
31839,Lun...Aus!
31840,"Some may find their inspiration tucked away in tomes, or by carousing in the cities, but I find it here in the vast expanses of Skyrim."
31841,"If you can get to the bottom of this, the Priesthood of Arkay will reward you. Take my key, and be careful."
31842,Looks safe now. Let's move.
31843,"The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies."
31844,"Any time I get tired of working, I just think that maybe that next swing will make me rich. It keeps me going."
31848,Not so loud!
31851,"Needless to say, these rebels and I have no love for each other. "
31858,"I'm not sure what you're playing at, but you'd do well to remember your place around here."
31860,...I can't believe this...
31862,"If money's all you hold dear, then you you end up like Jaree-Ra. A plague on the city."
31863,"By the gods, let this mine be small so we can be done with it quickly."
31865,Are you sure about this?
31866,"We haven't forgotten your crimes, outlander."
31867,"Food, experience and a roof over my head in the finest city in Skyrim."
31868,"Something different about you, I can tell. Hope you ain't here to cause trouble."
31872,"Some call me a mercenary, but I like to think of myself as a freelance adventurer for hire."
31873,"Really? I knew he was mixed up in something dangerous, but I hadn't heard he was dead."
31875,Let me put it to you this way.
31876,Best not to walk the roads of Skyrim alone.
31877,"If those Whiterun guards can take down a dragon, so can we."
31878,You have my thanks.
31881,I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all dov felt the... sundering of Time itself.
31886,Why of course. And will you also be needing the bow that shoots rainbows? Or perhaps a quiver that dispenses beer?
31887,To think that I would sit down at the same table with that... Thalmor bitch. Either she walks or I do.
31888,I hope your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it.
31889,Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever magic he's using to shield himself.
31890,Look for yourself.
31892,I think it's time to leave...
31893,Are you joking?
31896,I guess I should join you more often.
31897,Ayarg garag gar!
31898,"I'd rather not tangle with her right now. We might be able to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step."
31899,Easy does it now.
31900,I knew you could do it!
31904,I have spoken. The Rotmulaag waits.
31905,"Someday all of Skyrim will worship Talos openly, as we do here."
31906,Easy does it.
31907,The Word calls you. Go to it.
31908,You don't know what freedom really means until you've lived on the river.
31909,"You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware."
31912,She... She didn't make it.
31915,What are we waiting for?
31916,"Old stonework. Gold, traps, and bones."
31918,Not until we're all ready. We have to go together.
31919,I'm as ready as I'm going to be.
31920,We need to get in there and stop this!
31921,"Oh... all right. If it's so important to you, I suppose I can help."
31922,Make yourself useful and chop up some firewood. There's a few coins in it for you.
31923,"Well, ain't gonna find her here. Haven't seen her in a while."
31924,Honest gold for honest work.
31926,They're saying the Dark Brotherhood has been destroyed. Wiped off the face off Tamriel. But that's not entirely true... is it?
31927,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
31929,"Have you met Lucky? He's my pet goat, and he helps me patrol the town."
31933,These are troubled times. Be on your guard out there.
31934,Thanks again for helping reopen the East Empire Company. Gonna have them import me some of that aged Breton cheese.
31935,The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.
31940,"Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know."
31941,I've worked in the Treasury House for almost twenty years.
31942,"The Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes were written by the Mythic Dawn cult leader, Mankar Camoran."
31943,What's happening? What did you people do?
31945,"This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake."
31947,That was delicious.
31951,I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.
31953,I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?
31954,"Forgive me for my hasty opinion of you, I see that I was wrong and that there's much I can learn from you."
31955,"Well, least I can do is give you something for taking care of him. If you won't accept it as a payment, consider it a gift."
31956,Gods.... You two head inside and get some rest. I'll send word to the Jarl.
31961,"Hundreds of years have gone into assembling this collection. It's going to stay pristine, understand?"
31963,Let's finish this.
31964,"I can't take this place anymore. The trees... all the colors, but the city, so dark. Why? It makes no sense."
31965,I believe the Legate gave you an order. Why are you standing around here flapping your jaw? Move out!
31966,"Watching the wheel isn't as simple as you might think. Have to inspect all the way around the ice, make sure it's not melting."
31967,I don't suppose it matters much anymore.
31969,"Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while."
31970,"They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat."
31971,"They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating."
31973,Roggi and I do the work around here. My wife and brats just sit around on their brains wasting time.
31975,Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...
31976,"You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on."
31980,"You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to."
31982,"If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?"
31983,Arob and Gharol eye me with envy. They don't know how to please their chief.
31984,Use the key to open the door! We have to be quick!
31986,"Dig, Dwemer, in the beyond. I'll know your lost unknown and rise to your depths."
31987,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Just... these hunters. We're all on edge.
31989,"I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane."
31990,It's time you learned a lesson.
31991,I will commune with Azura.
31992,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
31993,"Oh, good. I wanted to try that out as soon as possible."
31994,I knew it!
31995,Indeed. I... I thought you captured the Butcher.
31996,Yes - don't kill the Gourmet!
31997,"Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that."
31998,"But, I've got the key to the Sabre Cage! Look!"
32000,"And despite the Imperials and their treaty, he will always be one of the Nine Divines."
32001,I'll rip you in half!
32002,"Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way."
32007,We want compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
32008,"Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful."
32010,What rumors?
32012,I'll... Kill you!
32014,"Actually... on second thought, I'll just kill you!"
32017,Smell that? Blood.
32018,"Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter."
32019,"See, that wasn't so difficult, was it."
32020,I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane's got that honor. Man's steel is legendary. All I ask is a fair chance.
32021,"They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches."
32022,Do you bring word from Malacath?
32023,The Razor is Mehrunes Dagon's personal artifact. It has always heralded bloody change and carnage.
32024,"Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm."
32027,"I care little for idle conversation, but perhaps you need help with Conjuration magic?"
32029,Very well then.
32031,Until next time.
32034,"Chin up, Brand-Shei. Lady Mara will provide us strength and guidance through these difficult times."
32036,May wisdom light your path.
32037,"If you've business with the College, you're welcome to stay here. It's where most of our business comes from, in fact."
32038,"What, you still think it's funny?"
32039,Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer. Nothing else is more important.
32041,The fair Jonna does me a great courtesy by allowing me to entertain the guests of her noble establishment.
32042,Put on a cloth sack at the very least. You're making me... unseasonably warm...
32043,"Until later, then."
32044,"Iron's a good, stout metal. A fine thing for a Nord to dig."
32045,Did you hear all that noise outside?
32046,"M'aiq once walked to High Hrothgar. So many steps, he lost count. "
32048,But is it safe for you to be here? We heard that Ulfric had been captured...
32049,"Oh, yes. Presiding over the union of two lovers is one of my greatest responsibilities. It helps that Asgeir and Vittoria truly care for each other."
32050,Where's Anuriel?
32051,"Yes, yes, so you said. But so what? The end is upon us. I may as well die here as anywhere else. I'm tired of running."
32052,"Goodbye, then."
32053,Do enjoy yourself.
32056,I'm not out to win friends and I could care less if you're happy about your purchase or not. I just need the coin.
32059,Where is it? I know you were trying to keep it for yourself J'zhar... You always try to keep it for yourself!
32063,"Now, let's see what there is to see."
32067,Kesh could tell you more. I just want out of Skyrim as quickly as possible.
32068,"But I digress. Here, take these to your, um... superior. "
32069,Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.
32070,"With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form. "
32071,"Your continuing aid to Septimus renders him increasingly obsolete. He has served me well, but his time is nearing its end."
32073,Talking peace with Ulfric? You must be an optimist.
32075,"Well you see where we have to live. This forgotten alley. All the filth from the upper quarters flows downhill, like they say."
32076,The way you walk around at home is your own business. When you're at home...
32078,And I have no more time for talking. Go speak with Kesh if you are so curious.
32079,I'm promoting you to Quaestor.
32087,Keep your wits about you. Morthal's hardly a safe place.
32089,I want word on our campaign against the Imperials.
32091,I am done with you. You may go.
32092,...s-sleeping? No! Burn the temple! Kill the priests!
32093,I'm listening.
32095,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to figure out how we're going to fill our recently emptied mine."
32096,"Here, how about a little token for your efforts? My family's ring and all the things the guards confiscated from you when you were jailed."
32097,"Alok, Viinturuth. Tiid boaan."
32100,You have to let me out. They're going to do something awful to me!
32102,Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else.
32103,"Hey boy, I heard you nailed a Septim into Lucan's doorstep. Damn near drove him crazy. That true?"
32104,Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.
32106,"I'm a deadeye marksman, lethal with a blade and dangerous in bed. And it only gets better from there."
32107,Why can't you just settle down and run the Flagon with me?
32108,You already know all that I know.
32110,You've already learned all I can teach you.
32113,There's nothing more I can teach you.
32114,"I run the prisons in Riften, keep the riff-raff from robbing the good folk of this city and have drunks tossed into the lake."
32120,I also handle the less important and day-to-day policies that effect daily life in Riften.
32121,"Don't worry, I'll make it worth your while."
32124,The Empire is in shambles. They've banned the worship of Talos.
32125,"It is an... artifact from outside time. It does not exist, but it has always existed. Rah wahlaan. They are...hmm... fragments of creation. "
32126,She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful.
32127,Seems there's always more to be done...
32128,"Ulfric ordered us to stop fighting. Didn't want us all to die for nothing, I guess."
32130,Thank you for sticking by me.
32136,I think they like you.
32139,Would you two shut up before Brurid hears you messing around.
32140,If you say so.
32143,Good. The two of us then. All of Skyrim should get ready to stand aside.
32144,I don't care what you think. The Empire put Maven on the throne for a reason. That's all you need to know.
32145,"How are you today, Thaena?"
32151,My guards told me. Poor Margret. And witnesses report that the attacker was shouting some nonsense about being a Forsworn.
32152,"Hey, if the Empire and the Stormcloaks want to kill each other over some foolish cause, I say let 'em."
32153,"Do be careful with that spell, will you?"
32154,We're passing Fort Sungard. Unbelievable view from up there. No wonder the Empire built a fort on that hill way back when.
32155,"They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire. Very powerful, very secretive."
32158,Thank you. I'll be sure to get Elgrim to examine this as soon as his... busy schedule allows.
32159,Ulfric's a bloody hero. I don't think there's a worthy Nord alive who'd dare argue the point.
32162,"Lorkhan's eyes! Look at that big bastard! Keep your head down, let's see what it does."
32164,I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.
32165,"Vittoria did pretty well for herself, marrying that Asgeir. Not a bad looking fellow at all."
32166,I find that highly unlikely... I think it would be irresponsible to write that in to the verse.
32168,Watch your step in here. The stonework gets slippery.
32173,Then get out of my way. I have to get to a town and find a priest.
32175,"Hmph. Fine. Suit yourself. But you're wrong, anyway. Just look at the fool. I don't know what it is, but he's damn well guilty of something."
32178,I'm on my way to Windhelm to join up with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric has the right of it.
32179,Into the tunnel. Let's go.
32182,I've got a message for you from Louis Letrush. This is for double crossing him.
32183,Here. Take a look at this. Some of the Jarl's men came by and left this bounty letter.
32185,Excellent. You've done us a great service. Here is your reward. 
32189,"If I can make enough money here in Skyrim, I think I'll travel to Hammerfell and see what work I can get there."
32190,"In a Daedra, of course."
32191,The butler did it! Or is it the advisor? Whoever that man behind the throne was.
32192,This new armor fits me like a glove.
32193,I'm not sure. None of them were working on anything terribly dangerous.
32194,Can't say I blame you. I'll find someone to take care of it.
32195,Guards! Forsworn!
32196,"Ro means ""Balance"" in the dragon tongue. Combine it with Fus - ""Force"" - to focus your Thu'um more sharply."
32197,I'm just worried about raising a child in the middle of this war of yours.
32199,"Good to see you again! How would you like to hire a brave, if untested, mercenary?"
32200,"I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?"
32202,Faaz! Paak! Dinok!
32203,"If my friends find out you've been bothering me, you'll be very sorry!"
32204,J'zargo is ready for more adventure.
32206,"If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you brother."
32209,You fought well. I find you worthy.
32210,We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!
32213,"You need to start pulling your own weight around here, otherwise I might ""forget"" to offer you any more jobs."
32216,"For a modest fee, I'll bring my formidable arcane powers to bear against your foes. What do you say?"
32217,Why hire a common soldier to protect you when you can have a master of the arcane?
32218,Everyone thinks Thorald is dead. But not me. I know my boy is alive out there. Somewhere...
32219,"Can't be too careful these days, with the war and other dangers. For a fair price, I'll watch your back."
32220,"Well, that's where I started. But it turned into something of a ballad."
32221,I've hardly anything worth pickpocketing...
32222,"If you've got the gold to pay my fee, then my sword-arm is yours."
32223,"Thank you! I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble."
32225,My wife is dead! Dead!
32226,They threw me in here because I called Ulfric a liar; a deceiver.
32228,"I'm what you'd call of soldier of fortune. Make me an offer, and I just might fight at your side."
32232,"A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals."
32235,I'm not going into the mine with draugr lurking down there.
32236,"You must bring it to Avanchnzel, in the west. Return it to them. It must go back."
32238,I won't be the one to go back there. I won't return to Avanchnzel. You can't make me do it.
32240,Zu'u uth nall thurri dein daar miiraak.
32242,"My sweet Leanora, I will never let anything happen to us. I promise."
32244,Did you still need me for something?
32245,Seems no one in this city has.
32246,Don't hurt me!
32247,Thank you for releasing us from her spell.
32250,"I want to check on Grani, one of our horses. Goodbye, stranger."
32252,Pa always says good men need few words.
32254,A man like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
32255,"If you think you can hold Riften, you're as deluded as you've always been."
32257,Safe travels.
32259,If you're heading up to Solitude you should stop to check out the view on your way. It's a good one.
32260,"So... I've been thinking... I'm grateful we're friends. I'd like you to have this. It's not much, but I hope it's something you like."
32261,Stay warm and keep sober. It's the two things I know for sure will make life better.
32262,(Heavy breathing)
32264,"If you could give me a healing potion, I could cleanse this poison from my body and get back to my life."
32267,"Svari, Jala said you stole an apple from her cart yesterday. Is this true?"
32268,"But that battle isn't expected until tomorrow... Ruki, what's going on?"
32269,"I don't understand... did you say Ulfric Stormcloak? Fine fellow, although a bit too fond of... I mean, no, of course, I condemn him in the most..."
32272,"So, what do you think of my plan. You in or out?"
32275,"Sorry, the mine's dry right now."
32277,"The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax?"
32279,Good hunting. Go kill some bandits for me.
32282,"Well done, indeed. Please accept this as a sign of my thanks."
32284,On your knees!
32285,You're supposed to be at the meadery.
32287,"Ha! By Shor, this city could use more like you."
32289,Keep safe. And always wear your armor.
32290,Return anytime you need arms or armor. My forge never rests.
32291,Come back to Bits and Pieces anytime.
32294,Addvar won't sell anything if I don't go and check up on him.
32295,All I care about is cause and effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray area.
32297,"I got someone who deserves a beating, but I need someone else to do it for me. I can pay."
32298,"No, but I know that you're going to turn up missing if you keep up this kind of talk."
32301,Kill.
32302,"Whatever you did at Honningbrew, you're now on her good side. Best of all, if she's happy, Mercer's happy."
32304,"The Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client."
32305,Stop back anytime.
32307,Clearly. I've never even thought of him in that manner. I wish that I was as skilled with words as he.
32308,"My brother takes council from Proventus Avenicci? What a laugh. He takes council from his daughter, and she's a bloody blacksmith."
32310,"Brynjolf, have you had a chance to speak to our contact in Whiterun?"
32311,Perhaps I'll be seeing more of you.
32312,"It's been a hard day cleaning. Good, honest work I say."
32315,Watch the walls for the sphere constructs... they can appear in the blink of an eye.
32317,"Another poem, I'll bet. He does know how to make a girl blush."
32318,The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Eight.
32322,Is he? You've saved him?! I must see him at once!
32323,"Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea."
32324,Keep the faith.
32326,"Blessed are those who worship, for they know true grace."
32327,I do so love Riften. I journeyed here in my youth. A thief took my purse... so I took his eyes. It was a fair exchange.
32329,It is Ri'saad who owns the three trading caravans that travel the roads of Skyrim.
32330,Are we really the first to make it to Riverwood?
32332,It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the Red Mountain.
32334,Yield or suffer!
32335,"Stay strong. The Eight willing, we'll win this war."
32336,I should get over to Windhelm more. See how the other Morrowind refugees are getting along.
32337,"The visions continue to hold me in balance, Gorm."
32338,Oh. Well. Good day.
32340,Leave me be. I'm no harm here.
32341,Wow. Would you look at that.
32342,"I'm the Jarl, not a barkeep. Speak your business."
32343,"We just want that old native to hand over his land in payment for our services. Then we'll leave, and everyone can get back to work."
32345,"...tra la la, tra la lee, da da dum dum, dee dee..."
32347,Not now.
32348,No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons.
32349,"Please, carry on."
32350,It's best you leave me be. 
32351,"She's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside."
32352,I guess he's better at all that talking stuff anyway. I'd just mess everything up.
32353,Take care if you're venturing too far from town. That's a bitter wind coming off the Sea of Ghosts.
32354,"Never much cared for that Balgruuf myself. He was in the Empire's pocket, so to speak. "
32355,"If you'll excuse me, I have other things to attend to."
32356,I see. He did not survive. He... He died well?
32358,"What do you need, stranger?"
32359,May the light of truth keep the darkness at bay.
32360,May Arkay bless you with a long life.
32362,Indeed.
32364,"I guess I should be getting back to work. It was more fun talking, though."
32367,"Well, if you do, grab him and yell. Bastard stole from me."
32370,"If Erdi caught me chatting, I'd never hear the end of it..."
32374,"Find out why he's here, and what he wants."
32375,You wield... Azura's Star? How... how can such a thing be possible?
32376,"You can catch me at the Blue Palace later, if you want to talk again."
32380,"Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature."
32381,I offer remedies for ailments both common and rare. Do let me know if I can be of service.
32382,'Jiit caravan brought this shop a nice piece from Elsweyr. Think you can break into their strongbox and get it for us?
32384,"Hey you. Yeah, you. Fresh meat for your stomach."
32387,"Wonder what it's like for those Thalmor, now that they've been taken down a notch..."
32388,What could it mean? The return of the Dragonborn? And who among us could possibly hold that honor? And such power?
32390,I hope not. That ring is irreplaceable.
32391,"No, no! This can't be happening!"
32393,Sure thing. It's yours for a day.
32394,"Well done, sister. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement."
32396,Stay guarded. You never know what could be out there.
32397,I must return my attention to Elisif. If were were to lose another Jarl while I was... distracted...
32399,I don't believe in getting my hands dirty. You have people that handle those sort of things... use them.
32402,I won't forget what you've done for Solitude.
32404,Please feel welcome in the court of Solitude.
32406,No.
32407,"Welcome, friend, to Calixto's House of Curiosities!"
32409,"We couldn't have taken this city without you, sir."
32413,Keep the faith. General Tullius will win this war.
32414,"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as Argonian, but as dovah!"
32416,Be well. Pray for Solitude and my husband.
32417,"Well, well."
32419,"With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately."
32421,Seems the Emperor's coming to Skyrim... and one of his own protectors was going to have him assassinated. Can't trust anyone these days.
32423,You are excused.
32425,"I'll be sure to check ""Talk to random stranger"" off my list of today's tasks..."
32426,I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do.
32430,Beg pardon. You dropped some armor over there. Don't suppose you'd mind if I... took it?
32432,"If you think I'd would make a move like that without asking Maven, you're out of your mind. Doing that would be a fatal mistake."
32433,I must return to the court. They simply can't make do without me.
32434,Keep your sword arm strong.
32435,"I'm not ""fretting."" I don't want Eirid playing those sorts of games!"
32436,"Dear, that spell is making me nervous."
32438,Kill them all. Protect the Jarl at all costs!
32439,"Why in goodness name would you have... oh never mind, just bring them by my house later and I'll see what I can do."
32441,It's been an honor.
32444,"Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting."
32445,Thanks for taking the time. People never want to talk to me.
32449,"I'm trying, but Ulfric is set in his ways. For him, there's two kinds of people in this world -- Nords, and the folk beneath them."
32451,We should talk again sometime.
32452,"Here, just like I promised. This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again."
32453,"Oh, if you haven't heard Dean Pantea sing, you should."
32454,"You're always a sight for sore eyes. Here, I've been hanging on to this for you."
32455,My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
32457,"Very well, Thongvor. With the Stormcloaks here to help, the Silver-Blood family control nearly every route in and out of the city."
32458,"Anytime, friend."
32459,Always good to talk to a fellow bard.
32460,Until Ulfric came and put them down.
32461,Argh!
32462,"So this is your plan, Lucan?"
32463,Do you like magic? Falion says I'm good at learning. I like learning about magic.
32464,We're done then? Good.
32467,Glad that distraction's over...
32469,"Winterhold's glory days may lie behind it, but the College lives on."
32470,"Don't forget my name. Someday, everyone will be saying it."
32471,Now you can say you've met the most talented bard in all of Skyrim.
32472,May all your adventures be worthy of telling.
32473,May the words of poets keep you warm.
32476,"Comes with living to a ripe old age, people start thinking there's something magical about you. Then, the insults."
32478,"I'm not a coward, outlander. You want me to prove it? Fine. My axe is yours. To the most dangerous corners of Skyrim and back."
32481,I don't want to see you ever again.
32482,Yeah. Next time.
32483,I was done talking anyway.
32484,"Need anything, you just say the word."
32485,"Papa doesn't like when I talk to customers, anyway."
32486,Come back if you want to play tag.
32487,"Ah, yes. You've proven to be a real bloodhound. Well, you've sniffed me out."
32491,Don't forget me next time you need herbs and potions.
32492,I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it? 
32495,What did you do in Wolfskull cave?!
32500,I'm just sayin' you should pick one to settle down with.
32504,Not my finest hour. Roggvir was a fine and honorable man.
32507,Yes. Our order was founded after the Oblivion Crisis. We dedicate our lives to facing the threat of Daedra wherever they appear.
32509,"No... please, you have to help me! You don't understand what they do to people here!"
32511,"Whatever the case may be, her intentions are far from benevolent."
32512,A citizen of Falkreath has asked for our help.
32514,Sometimes you just do what needs to be done. You don't have to hate a man to kill him.
32517,"My books tell the stories. Have no doubt - as pretty as its streets are, as jovial as the bards may be... darkness is drawn to Solitude."
32518,"I see. You're a good soldier, Horik. I'm sorry for intruding."
32519,"Yes, but it's no easy matter. "
32520,"This city has a long history of madness and murder. The Wolf Queen... Pelagius... The death of High King Torygg... And now, public executions."
32526,This war of yours makes it difficult for a resourceful woman to advance her interests.
32528,Ain't got one. But I'd fancy a chance at that Jaree-Ra's scrawny neck.
32531,"Mauhulakh. I remember him. Little, scrawny, fellow."
32532,Suit yourself.
32535,The few works of his that have been recovered suggest that he had an understanding of magic and the world that few have ever achieved.
32537,Can any man hope to be ready for a dragon?
32540,"Such an investment will mean that I can take better care of my family, as well as my customers."
32542,Battle-Born! Give me your money!
32543,No. No I can't.
32544,My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.
32547,Really? Was it big? Did it breath fire?
32552,"Just in time. This is Adelaisa, one of my superiors from the Company."
32553,"Impossible actually. Hmm, I wonder..."
32554,I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...
32555,So now he's dead.
32556,I... have been known to change my mind. So... go. Really.
32557,"One night Ranmir was in here like always, drinking himself to death."
32560,"By the way, you might want to stop in at Warmaiden's. These days, folk need all the protection they can get."
32566,"Are you sure you wouldn't rather explore, say, a nice tavern?"
32567,Get in good with them and you'll find her.
32570,"Stay out of trouble, Orc."
32571,But moving on to business. As you probably already know from reading the letter... you're going to a wedding.
32572,If you have need of hunting supplies then you've come to the right place.
32573,"Respect the law, and you'll have no trouble in Dragon Bridge."
32575,I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...
32576,"Then like Roggvir, you have a Nord's heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand."
32577,I'm Thongvor's steward now. Every coin in this city is ours.
32579,Where the Dragon attacked? 
32580,You must deliver those items to your superior. And I... I must get out of this foul place.
32581,Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.
32582,"Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities."
32583,Go. Away. Please!
32584,No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart woman steers clear of Stentor.
32585,You're trespassing here. You'd better clear out.
32586,And keeps himself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
32587,You have your orders. Rendezvous with the rest of the men outside Korvanjund.
32589,Look at that. I've told you to watch your tongue and mine is waggling. I've said enough.
32590,Let's just say the headsman's axe may not be the worst way for a Solitude Jail prisoner to die. 
32591,"I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace."
32594,Breton.
32595,If you're looking for a good attitude go see the Bards. They'll fake it for you if nothing else.
32597,All right.
32598,"Well... This seems to be in order. Very well, follow me."
32601,"From that point forward, every time Vivienne and I were anywhere close to each other, he made sure to humiliate me."
32603,Do you have no better reason for acting than destiny? Are you nothing but a plaything of dez... of fate?
32604,Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.
32605,Nothing personal.
32606,"I have no idea why, but one day, I told Roggvir I liked her. It was a stupid thing to do... He mocked me incessantly after that."
32607,It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there.
32608,No mercy!
32611,"Why thank you for that most colorful assessment, Skulvar."
32612,I think we can trust Karliah. Let's see what she's on about.
32613,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
32614,Shadows take you!
32616,"Well, yes! Please!"
32617,Heard you hit somebody in town not too long ago.
32620,It also makes it easier to gather water when the canal is right out the front door.
32621,Stand... still!
32625,"Just keep moving, you'll wear him out!"
32626,When Grimvar asks me why women are being killed around the city. I don't even know what to say to him.
32627,Watch the eyes!
32628,Here. You deserve a reward for your service.
32629,"Its location was lost for centuries, but I know where it is: Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden within the crags of the Reach."
32630,Mind your own business.
32631,Strike when the shoulder turns. He's giving you openings!
32635,Why are you looking at me like that?
32636,No. Not yet.
32639,"We love you, Dark Brotherhood! Ha ha ha ha ha!"
32640,"You have committed a breach, and must pay the penalty."
32641,All right!
32646,Come on!
32647,"New blood? Oh, I remember you. Come on, follow me."
32648,And?
32649,"The Khajiit hail from a distant land called Elsweyr, bordered on the north by Cyrodiil and the south by the glistening blue waters of the sea."
32650,We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.
32651,Nice!
32652,Rrarggh!
32653,I don't care what's going on in the world. Rebellion. Dragons awakening. The mill is enough trouble for me to worry about.
32654,"If that's true, then we have much more to fear than the Thieves Guild."
32655,I said let's go. Now.
32657,Are you feeling sick?
32658,You don't look so tough. I'll bet I could take you.
32660,"You're not thinking of causing trouble here in this beautiful city, now are you? 'Cause I'd strongly advise against such foolishness."
32661,A cave. Dark. Dangerous.
32663,What are you waiting for?
32664,Keep a sharp eye about you and maybe I'll teach you to fight some day.
32665,Always good to see 'em go.
32666,"Forgive me. You're just the one in charge, and it's what I'm used to."
32667,I hope that dragon isn't still flying around here somewhere.
32668,"Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do."
32669,Your objective is Fort Kastav.
32670,There's the Blades agent! Kill her!
32671,Enough! Both of you!
32672,I know this place looks horrible -- please don't hold it against the Company.
32673,Things are easier now that I don't have to worry about Ranmir anymore.
32674,Stay away!
32677,"Until then, we have quite the task ahead."
32678,"No, we Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared."
32681,"Whatever you want to know, I don't care. I run a smelter. That's it."
32682,I'm sorry my lady. The stresses of all this research... it's becoming more than I can bear.
32684,I've been working on a shield for Aela.
32686,Wwwwwwrrrraaaaaahhhhh!
32687,That's impossible. I distinctly heard that lout in the tavern say it was a full shipment of furs. They should be worth a fortune.
32688,"Hey, a fight!"
32689,"Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby, relatively speaking."
32690,Get him!
32691,"I'll get word for him to meet you in Solitude, at the Winking Skeever -- you know it?"
32692,Good luck with the giant. Don't get stepped on.
32693,That's what I thought.
32694,It was said to force a dragon to experience the concept of Mortality. A truly vonmindoraan... incomprehensible idea to the immortal dov.
32699,As you wish. Whatever you can afford will certainly be put to good use.
32703,Paarthurnax? That name is familiar... the legendary leader of the Greybeards? 
32708,You stand right there and count to 10. No peaking. Ready? Okay go!
32709,Excellent. Put the fear of the Nine into those motherless dogs.
32711,You can't win this!
32715,"Hmm. Well, if that's what the Greybeards told you, I confess I don't have a better plan."
32718,"Son, I know thousands of the old ballads. If I played all of them, everyone in this inn would be as grey as I am before I finished."
32720,"You will see them... wuth fadonne... my friends - Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir."
32721,"Do we have anyone reliable to send out there? I don't want to look the fool again in front of her, Brynjolf."
32722,Yuck. Something smells.
32723,"Then you will feel - know - Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression."
32724,"Well, make sure we keep the patrols out night and day, just to be certain."
32725,Have you taken care of that... little problem?
32726,"No doubt they still tell tales of Mikael and his sweet songs across Cyrodiil, where last I traveled."
32727,It was Gallus who inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a razor sharp point. I owe everything to him.
32728,You don't have what it takes to kill me.
32733,"First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate ourselves overlooking the camp."
32734,For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.
32735,"And what's wrong with him, huh?"
32736,"He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him."
32737,I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason.
32738,"This is life, brother. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath."
32739,"In this courtyard, there are no Stormcloaks. There are no Imperials. There are only people, come to celebrate a union of two souls. So make merry!"
32741,You know Winterhold used to be the seat of power in Skyrim? Now it's a shell.
32743,"I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits."
32745,"Yeah, well I don't see anything."
32751,"Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with him being here all the time. He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay."
32752,"So few Nords have ever offered to help us, a discount is the least I can do."
32753,"Fortunately, they seem to be sticking to the barrow. I think they're guarding it."
32754,"Let's hope the miners didn't unearth anything besides precious stones, if you take my meaning."
32759,Hold it there! Keep your distance.
32760,Take him down! It's our best chance!
32761,Did my worthless husband send you?
32763,Bersi's afraid that someone's making a move to take the Pawned Prawn from us. I think he's being paranoid.
32764,"Stay out of trouble, lizard."
32765,Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is no justice in the world.
32766,Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve quite a bit of gold for her people.
32767,"Wujeeta, we need to talk."
32768,"You know, I could have gone into that Sanctuary. Killed all those Dark Brotherhood types. But I was... sick that day."
32769,Stay under cover!
32771,I hope Mirabelle is helpful in locating the Staff.
32774,Does anyone see him?
32777,That's it! We'll bring that bastard down!
32778,"By my honor, I pledge to rid Tamriel of dragons."
32781,I don't know you. You in Riften lookin' for trouble?
32783,"Please, let's not have it come to that."
32784,"I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like."
32786,"I've been waiting for you, my sweet one."
32788,I don't need to know the details. Blessings of Arkay to you for your help.
32790,There's the woman herself!
32792,"Fine. I can't force you to help me, but the offer is open."
32794,"I've only been a part of the Red Wave's crew for a few weeks, but I've already learned to stay out of Captain Safia's way."
32796,Steel. Barehanded. Armor. Naked. It's all fighting. I can kill you with a weapon or by myself. No difference.
32800,Yes?
32802,"Goodbye, dear."
32803,A dragon! I saw a dragon!
32814,"My blade is sharp and I thirst for battle. Onward, then! "
32816,That's a fair price. My blade is yours.
32821,"Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?"
32824,You seem to be a little short on coin. Come back and see me when you've got the gold.
32825,"Maybe, but..."
32826,All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else.
32828,"Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
32830,"Return to the pretender, tell her I'm dead! Tell her you strangled me with my own intestines! Ha ha! But lie! Yes, lie! Lie, and let me live!"
32833,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
32834,"Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart."
32835,"With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all to the sword."
32837,What you don't hear about are the ones who break off from escorts on the way to Markarth.
32840,"Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm."
32841,"Well, if some Moon Sugar should fall into your lap..."
32842,The grindstone will improve your weapons. Use the table to improve your armor.
32849,I am proud of all of you. 
32850,Orgnar!
32852,"However, I did notice she was quite angry and it was being directed at Mercer Frey."
32853,"Wait, where did you get this? This piece was thought to be lost forever, please take this with my utmost thanks!"
32854,The ale is going bad. We need to get a new batch.
32856,Yep. Ale's going bad.
32857,"Speak to me, Shield-Brother."
32858,I guess you don't have potatoes in your ears after all. Just make sure we get a fresh batch in soon.
32860,"The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Falkreath. Jarl Siddgeir will step down, and Dengeir of Stuhn will take his place as Jarl."
32863,"Die, ya cowardly lubber!"
32864,Tag! You're it!
32865,"Avast, dog!"
32866,"There's fine steel at the Scorched Hammer, if you fancy a new blade."
32867,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
32870,Yarr!
32871,"I'm not sure whether it's the soil, the climate or the favor of the Divines, but we've never had a poor harvest."
32875,"Ah, you're back."
32878,"It's not the most exciting place in the world, but the people here work hard and don't cause trouble for anyone."
32879,How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?
32881,Of course they don't count!
32882,Excuse me? What kind of question is that?
32883,"Run fast, my friend."
32884,"Succeed, and you may keep your title and my armor, and I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Blackness. "
32885,Why do your people claim the Reach is theirs? The Orcs have been in these lands just as long.
32888,Hagraven up ahead. Pull the lever when you're ready and we'll take her.
32889,"Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying to avoid untimely deaths."
32892,"As for honor, well, there are some luxuries even I can't afford."
32896,"Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms."
32899,"Fine, Elf-Lover. I'll find her myself."
32900,Will do.
32902,"I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!"
32903,Ha! I'll see to it the Jarl hears of your abuse of a court scholar. Shame on you.
32906,Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread.
32911,"Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing that luxury with those who can appreciate it."
32915,"These people are like cattle. All they do is work, sleep and eat."
32916,"Perhaps, but it just means more work for me."
32917,So you're the one from the... Dark Brotherhood? I need you to kill the Big Laborer at Katla's Farm. Here's the gold for the kill. Make it painful.
32918,Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.
32919,Then she left to join the Stormcloaks.
32920,"When I tell you to, try and hit all four targets in ten seconds."
32923,I have no business with you. Leave me.
32924,"No, not really. Couriers don't seem to like delivering letters here."
32925,I think you may have joined the wrong side. You showed yourself to be a true friend to the Empire today.
32927,"It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the credit."
32928,"I've spent most of my life as a trader. I've got a stake in several shipping ventures across Tamriel, mostly imports and exports."
32929,"No, no, of course not. Forgive me, Dragonborn. I have been intemperate with you."
32931,"So if one of them says they're going to do something, I believe them. When you can just take what you want, there's no need to lie."
32932,"You're leaving? Okay, we'll just work on the verse in a bit."
32935,"Ignore the Orc. He pays, so I let him stay."
32937,I don't know why you gave Ulfric so much. That murderer will never rule Skyrim.
32939,Must it be written? Poetry is so dull when it isn't set to music.
32940,"A delicate question, to be sure. I'm the Emperor's cousin, and the Empire has little love for the Thalmor."
32941,"Whatever you did, it worked. Let's see what else those old Blades left in our way."
32943,"Not really. It's just a bunch of elders standing around, looking important. I wish something exciting would happen. "
32944,"If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband. If you're looking for company, I suppose I could do worse."
32946,"But I do respect power, and the Thalmor have that. They leave me alone, and I leave them alone."
32947,I care little about the politics and rivalries between the Thalmor and the Empire.
32948,We have a relationship of mutual respect.
32951,"Don't mention the Guild. In fact, it's better if you don't speak to me at all. This is not the place."
32953,"How can we? We're a community of farmers, not fighting men."
32954,Have you learned nothing about me? I have dealings with everyone.
32957,I'm glad they finally believed me. About the assassin I mean. It's been so hard since my Torygg passed. No one takes me seriously.
32959,I know it's a bit strange. Not exactly a name to bring comfort to the sick and ailing who come to buy a poultice or salve.
32960,"You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned."
32961,I lead the Justiciars. We are charged with enforcing the ban on Talos worship.
32962,The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.
32963,That'll teach you to break the law on my watch.
32967,"We must make them see their danger, Dragonborn."
32969,Up the stairs! Quickly!
32970,I've never trusted him... what has he done?
32971,Wait here. I'll be right back with your reward.
32972,"On behalf of the Empire, and myself, please accept this gift along with your new rank."
32973,Not bad. Now turn me back.
32976,"But make no mistake, this is not a peace forged out of necessity between rival nations of equal strength."
32977,"There is peace now, and that peace will continue for as long as it suits our needs."
32981,"I would refuse, but I don't want to jeopardize the peace between us."
32982,I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me out.
32983,"Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly."
32984,He gives other merchants a bad name.
32986,We want the Pale returned to Imperial control. The traitor Skald the Elder will be replaced with a more loyal candidate.
32988,The Thalmor invite me here to remind everyone that they can tell the Empire what to do.
32989,That's putting it mildly.
32990,But mark me well -- I will purge the heresy from this land as surely as the flame burns the flesh from the bone.
32993,It must be the Stormcloaks! Find them!
32997,"I've seen a lot of thieves come and go, but I've never seen anyone as good as me."
32998,What? Oh. Bye.
32999,"Well, I used to sneak out at night and try to tip over the big ox in the Gray-Manes' yard."
33000,They aren't my boys. Do I look like the leadin' type?
33001,Ill luck. I'm a busy man and I don't have time for this sort of frivolity.
33003,Whenever you're ready to leave.
33005,I just hope this party doesn't drag on all night.
33006,You need to take better care of your sister.
33010,See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going!
33012,"Truth be told, I'd be more comfortable if I were back there. I get nervous in the company of so many worthies."
33013,I'm the Steward of Whiterun. I serve Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach.
33015,"Though I confess, being surrounded by so many wealthy and important people makes me feel more than a little nervous."
33016,"Yes, I am indeed. Elenwen always serves the best wine at her parties. The food is excellent as well."
33017,I don't want any trouble. Not after what you did to me last time.
33020,I'm Anska.  Are you here to help?
33023,"This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm still nervous."
33025,Have you tried the wine?  It's better than anything in the Blue Palace.
33028,My daughter! Dead! Noooooo!
33034,My only regret is that she doesn't host them more often.
33035,Elewen's parties are always so elegant. She really has impeccable taste.
33037,"Very much so, yes."
33038,But they'll keep you busy. Just do them as you're able. There's no real time limit - the targets aren't going anywhere.
33041,"Lucky for you, I possess a forgiving nature and I'm not easily insulted."
33042,"You must have me mistaken for someone else. I am Elisif, widow of High King Torygg and Jarl of Solitude."
33044,I beg your pardon?
33048,Elenwen must be very fond of you.
33049,Killed my first creature in a cave just like this... I'll never forget it.
33050,"These Thalmor might not like to admit it, but as long as the Empire has Skyrim, the Empire has strength."
33051,That's some fine Imperial armor you've got there.
33055,"Favor the bow, eh? I'm a sword man, myself."
33056,"I'd rather be back at Whiterun, but while I'm here I might as well get some real news from the other parts of Skyrim."
33058,"If I'm really lucky, I'll get to kiss the bride for good luck."
33059,"I have things to study, what is it?"
33062,"You and I are alike. We seek challenge and great fortune. But for me, that's where the similarities end."
33063,"Not well at all, and I'm happy to keep it that way."
33064,There's every chance I'll return to find a pile of smoking ash where Whiterun once stood.
33065,Rrrrrraaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
33066,"What is more, I'm away from the hold at a time when there are dragons and Stormcloaks on the loose."
33073,"Welcome to Riften, home of the Thieves Guild. Or so they'd have you believe. It's all lies. They're just thugs... vermin, creeping around the Ratway."
33075,"If a man can't feel at home in a freezing cave, then he isn't truly a Nord."
33077,"Dragons, murder, rebellion... and we sail right into the middle of it with the Emperor on board."
33078,You been to Markarth? They've got a tavern called the Silver-Blood Inn. Best ale this side of Skyrim.
33080,Save your anger for the forge. The steel cannot hear your whining.
33081,"As far as I'm concerned, those Talos-worshippers get what they deserve. All they do is cause problems for me and the other Jarls."
33083,And also long enough to respect her importance to Skyrim. She plays a vital role in rooting out the forbidden worship of Talos.
33084,I've known her long enough to appreciate her excellent taste in food and wine.
33087,"Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad."
33089,"Speak with the Nervous Patron at Candlehearth Hall, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
33090,"That wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road."
33092,"Ogmund the skald. He's old, respected, and I know for a fact that he worships Talos in his home."
33093,"Yes, I know what you mean. Most Nords struggle to accept change."
33095,"There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages."
33096,"If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of judgement and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber."
33099,"Be about your business, while I'm about mine."
33100,"Now, Ralof, what's going on? You two look pretty well done in."
33101,"No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!"
33102,"Just go away, please."
33103,"Oh, it's you. I didn't think you could handle this on your own. Did you get rid of Christer?"
33104,Fair fight. Here you are.
33105,"No, I really don't. It'll be a while before I'm ready for that. I'll be on my way now."
33108,Unh!
33109,"I weep for you, mortal."
33111,I've had yet another complaint. Please stop barging in on experiments in progress.
33112,I just wonder what her real motivations are. That woman is inscrutable.
33113,"I told you, I've got no patience for fools. Keep walking."
33114,Knife. Yes. Book. Yes. Bucket. Yes. Inkpot? No.
33116,Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.
33119,"Well enough, I suppose."
33120,"That is where your job ends and mine begins. The work of the mind, sadly undervalued in Skyrim."
33122,Malacath preserve you.
33123,I hope I'm wrong. I'm not sure the Empire can afford another war.
33124,"Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how."
33125,I suspect the treaty that ended the war was just a tactic to buy time so the Thalmor can rebuild their armies.
33126,Why do you think? End of the line.
33127,We weep.
33128,"For now, perhaps. But I've heard disturbing rumors that they're marshalling their strength."
33129,"At least, if you're gonna cause trouble, go somewhere else, okay? Please?"
33132,Is the food and drink to your liking?
33133,"Oh, but the Dwemer had more than even Septimus expected."
33134,For the Blades!
33136,Crossing the Guild was a bad idea. I'll buy goods from you after you settle your accounts.
33139,"Very much so, and thank you for asking."
33140,"Everything is splendid, thank you."
33141,Damn ears... playing tricks on me again. Can't stand this sea air!
33142,"Just have a few swings at me so I can see your form. Don't worry, I can take it."
33143,"I suppose so, yes."
33145,I have no complaints.
33146,"As much as can be expected, yes."
33147,"Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then. "
33148,It pleases me to hear you say so.
33149,You've done a larger service to the realm than you could possibly know. A resurrected Potema... I shudder at the thought.
33150,"Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry."
33151,"Goodbye, my love."
33152,We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?
33154,I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
33155,We've had the same troubles.
33156,"You surrender Hjaalmarch to us, and take Idgrod Ravencrone with you. Sorli the Builder will take over as Jarl of Morthal."
33160,Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice.
33163,I trust you'll put your weapon away?
33165,We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.
33166,We're looking for a fugitive who comes from Hammerfell. A Redguard woman. She may be somewhere in this city.
33167,There's a nip in the air. Cold won't be good for my crops. Never is.
33168,"It just so happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and together see if you can't overpower the caravan."
33169,We have sworn loyalty to Yamarz. He will see us through these dark times.
33170,"Good fight going, here."
33174,Could you move? You're in the way.
33181,"Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed."
33182,Got you!
33183,"Are you going to let me watch, or not?"
33186,Poor bastard's better off.
33187,Oh well. Must have run off.
33188,"He isn't exactly in the Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the warehouse."
33193, 
33194,"I'm raising you to Praefect. Take this blade, as a gift and symbol of your new rank. You've earned it."
33195,"Not sure what's up there, but I bet the Greybeards know."
33198,"Ah, sweet freedom. Now that's more like it. You have my thanks, stranger."
33200,Welcome home.
33202,"I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much."
33205,"When you're rich, you can waste as much money as you like on far-fetched business ideas. In the meantime, there's a farm to run."
33206,The Jarl gives me two incompetent assistants. Worthless.
33207,"Some folk who make the trip leave them food or other essentials, but not to make conversation."
33208,"Praise be to Talos, this is a glorious day for Whiterun and for all Skyrim! Our liberators have come at last!"
33210,"You know who I am, fool. So why you askin'?"
33211,"One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even think about it."
33213,Enjoying the hospitalities of the inn. Suggest you do the same.
33214,"Yes, yes, as with you. Now be off."
33215,"Hmm... yes. I guess I can see how that would add a more... earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand..."
33216,"With Eorlund gone, I'm afraid I can't offer you much in the way of thanks. But please, take this. It's the least I can do."
33218,"I like to spend time up here. Walk the Steps, meditate on the emblems. Doesn't hurt when I bag some game along the way."
33220,You don't want to be here. No one wants to.
33221,Walking the Steps. Meditating on the emblems. I make this trip every few years.
33222,I don't think you belong here.
33223,"Just a pilgrim. I'd prefer to leave it at that, if you don't mind."
33225,I did. Strange days when the monks will do that. I wonder what it means.
33226,I was just outside Ivarstead when it happened. It's an exciting moment. Nothing like this has happened in centuries.
33228,"Your hearts are full of grief, and my own weeps at the loss of Skjor. "
33229,"No, no. I'm fine. Is there something you need?"
33230,"Do this, and I shall favor you."
33232,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
33233,Should be fun.
33235,"Straight to business with you, huh?"
33236,"Be warned, the Jarl is in a foul mood since the Stormcloaks overran Whiterun."
33239,Many folk think he set the fire himself. 
33241,"With the Empire's help, Winterhold will be back on its feet in no time."
33242,What? You have it?
33243,Hmm. How to explain in your tongue? The dov have words for such things that joorre do not.
33245,"I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother asking."
33247,It's been good talking to you.
33248,This is it. We've found Gathrik's tomb.
33250,Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is.
33251,Which is why I have lived here. For thousands of mortal years I have waited. I knew where he would emerge but not when.
33255,I knew better. Tiid bo amativ. Time flows ever onward. One day he would surface.
33256,Does Dravynea know?
33257,"Not intentionally. Some hoped he would be gone forever, forever lost. Meyye."
33258,"Been a murder, over in Riften. Some old lady who runs an orphanage. Those poor children must be heartbroken."
33260,"As long as the College keeps paying, I'll keep digging."
33261,"Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow."
33263,"They say ruins like these are filled with treasure. Of course, they're filled with traps, too."
33264,Let Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces.
33266,I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.
33272,Thank you. That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
33273,Well done. I wasn't certain you'd even know what to look for.
33274,What are we waiting for?
33278,"The cold stone, the dampness... it suits me, Svana."
33280,We must end the nightmares!
33281,"What business do College mages have in a place like Saarthal, anyway? It's a place for Nord dead... not your weird experiments."
33282,I have Gallus's journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.
33286,"I can hardly believe it myself, and I was there."
33288,Feel the Benevolence of Mara!
33290,"...once was a woman, as fair as an evenin', of springtime in old Stros M'Kai..."
33291,"Good to have a customer! You need food or drink, you say the word."
33292,"Begone, invader!"
33293,Wait. There's something different about you.
33294,"How dare you defile this temple, orc!"
33295,Vaermina forgive me...
33300,Can't fail now... must hang on...
33301,"For an outsider like you to be accepted, an Orc would have to make you Blood-Kin, and send word to the chiefs."
33302,"Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger."
33304,"Fine, then wait here. This should only take a second."
33305,Lady Mara... I await your embrace...
33306,Too much... can't...
33307,Yes. My older brother and the person you probably want to be speaking to right now.
33311,"With all due respect, Arch-Mage, I'm not in a position to just give this away."
33314,"Time to finally see the sky, and make it rain red."
33315,I'll follow your lead.
33316,"No, please! I don't understand..."
33317,..wha?... where?... D-destroy this place! Tear it apart!
33318,You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.
33319,Welcome home.
33321,...w...what happened? Wait! We're still under attack!
33322,"Once you find the courier's route, kill him and take his place."
33324,They mustn't stop us!
33325,Time for your final rest!
33326,"By Her Benevolence, you shall not stop us!"
33328,"I ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim."
33330,"Rest well and sleep deeply, my brother."
33331,"Forgive me, my brother."
33332,"He is most remembered for his great maze of Labyrinthian, said to hold ""Glamoril"", or the secret of life."
33335,"Back from whence you came, heathen!"
33337,We agreed to 750 gold. I want my money.
33338,"You and Sam dared me to go into that bandit camp. Well I did and brought back his stupid hat like you said, so give me the 10,000 gold you promised."
33340,"The information wasn't easy to come by, but everyone has a price. And a pain threshold."
33342,"Head over there, unless you feel like helping my wife pick crops. And then 50 years later you'll wake up and still be here."
33347,We've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left. No sign of Mercer.
33348,May the Hist guide us.
33349,"Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn you away from your destiny."
33350,"Hey, where do you think you're going? Come back here."
33352,Praefect.
33353,"We caroused together with Sam Guevenne, remember? We broke into the Temple of Dibella? How much did you end up drinking?"
33356,Glory to the Forsworn!
33364,Here in Shor's house we honor it still.
33367,Seen enough magic in my day to know to stay away from it. I'd stay away from the Jarl's wizard in Dawnstar too. 
33369,"Stendarr's mercy - you aren't one of them. Please, you've got to help me!"
33370,"If there's one thing I hate more than a mean-spirited drunk, it's one who can't settle their debts."
33371,What's going on? Why would somebody do that?
33374,Well? What are we waiting for?
33379,"Nice try, but those bandits almost killed me. Now pay up."
33380,"Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you."
33381,Hard to believe there'd be an old crypt underneath the mine.
33382,"I can't see you, Reyda! I can't find you! Why are you hiding? Hiding, hide, hide, hide! Don't make me sad!"
33383,It's a wonder people can get anywhere around here. Maybe I'll avoid this entire hold for awhile. That said... I do have a few things to sell.
33386,"It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be served like any vegetable - cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled in a stew."
33389,But that may just be because I remember when you were just a whelp who was begging to join.
33390,You don't scare me.
33391,"I'm sorry, you're going to have to leave. Tell Brynjolf he'll just have to make due without my coin."
33396,"Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more comfortable discussing my findings with you."
33402,I don't think going back is a good idea.
33405,"Going back would be the end of all of us. We keep pushing forward, and we'll make it. We will!"
33406,"Come on, you can make it. Let's go."
33408,"In a world of fools, you stand out above the rest. Here, take this small sign of my friendship."
33410,"If you've got some business in Rorikstead, you should start by speaking to Jouane."
33411,"Go now. I have seen the threads of your fate in the Twilight, and you still have much to accomplish."
33412,"What else could we do? Stay there and die with her? She refused to go on, we didn't have a choice!"
33413,I'm on my feet all day. Can you please do this one thing for me?
33414,"Yes, youngling. Have a seat."
33415,It's good to be back in High Hrothgar after all these years.
33416,I'll be right with you.
33419,You pledge your soul to me?
33421,We've gone from a Jarl lost in her own head to a Jarl that cares for nothing but herself. Lot of good that does us.
33422,I had no choice! It was the only way to make sure that monster never escaped!
33423,What further business do you have with us?
33426,Take cover!
33427,"I promise you, I'll never let this happen again! I'll seal this whole place away..."
33428,Not to mention our pay.
33429,"You're not an Orc, or Blood-Kin, so stay out. We only help our own."
33430,"Really? Good show. Here, take this. You know, as a thank you."
33431,Out with it. What happened at the meadery?
33432,"When will you be makin' some more jewelry, love? Some silver lockets and amulets would fetch a nice price at the stand."
33434,"Master Borri will teach you ""Kest"" - ""Tempest""- the third word of Whirlwind Sprint."
33435,"You must have been away from your kind for a long time to forget. Come, speak to the chief and the wise woman and remember."
33437,"For a few septims, I'll give you a brief tour that includes some of my most unusual items."
33438,"This is our stronghold. Here, we are free to live as Malacath intended, away from the prying eyes of the Nords."
33439,"We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here. Remember that."
33440,"If I'm right Svaknir and King Olaf's Verse lie in Dead Men's Respite, along with the burial chamber of King Olaf himself."
33445,I hear talk about a regiment coming to clear the crypt out. We'll see if that happens.
33447,"I'm just the cook, lad."
33454,I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.
33455,"Let's get out of here, fast as we can!"
33456,Did you require something of J'zargo?
33457,"Now now, brother. Arnoit is just being his usual gloomy self, he didn't mean it, did you Arnoit? You're just being silly again."
33460,"I saw it fair when first I trod this long-sought path. The pain and fear vanished, dreamlike, and a vision beckoned -"
33463,I think it's holding!
33465,He is the Daedric Lord of the Orcs. The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
33466,I do. There is a freedom the roads give you that the stronghold does not.
33467,We live by his code and follow his teachings. Spend some time with the wise woman and you'll remember.
33468,You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
33470,"There are a few great strongholds worthy to talk about. Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur, Narzulbur, and Largashbur."
33471,You persist? Fine. You go tell Malacath to lift this curse from me. See how well he listens to you.
33472,"I've seen enough death to last three lifetimes, yet I never tire of a good fight. What do you make of that?"
33473,"I worry about the other settlements in the hold. Unwalled, lightly manned - prime targets for those damned dragons."
33474,And stay out.
33476,"J'zargo will give you scrolls, you will use them and report the results. This is a good plan, no?"
33477,Outlanders should mind their own business.
33480,Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg.
33484,"Oh, my dear Urag. You're trying so hard to help. I do hope you're not disappointed."
33485,Dorthe needs to spend more time in the garden. I could use the help.
33486,Please help. I can pay you.
33487,"He explained it all to me. Before, when I still understood. I don't remember, but I still know."
33489,"My contact, she says Hammerfell steel is much desired by certain parties."
33490,Are they gone?
33493,Alduin mahlaan
33496,"We're headed to Korvanjund. But, if old King Borgas is indeed buried there, we're bound to run into trouble of some kind."
33499,Who knows what we might find in here.
33504,She and Hod run the mill. I make a decent living sharpening axes and fixing the sawmill.
33505,"I welcome you, friend. How may I serve you?"
33506,Can you believe one person came in here and took out this whole camp?
33507,Your turn!
33508,Goodbye. Be careful if you head into the ruins.
33509,"Back to my studies, then."
33510,"Yes, yes. I have a lot of research to do."
33511,"What? Oh, goodbye."
33513,The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover. It should be here somewhere.
33515,I should heat up the forge. Why does it have to be so hot?
33516,Indeed.
33517,Keep your eyes open for Forsworn when you're on the roads.
33518,"If you'll excuse me, I have a city to run."
33519,"I'm ever so grateful. Please, give my regard to the rest of the Companions."
33521,Let this day be a final warning to all who would still call themselves Stormcloaks. 
33522,Fine. I guess you'll need your coin then.
33523,That amount should allow me to readily acquire a drink.
33527,Treachery! Attack!
33528,Bring more gold next time.
33529,I should get back to memorizing recipes.
33531,"Ah, but I can do that right here. Right now!"
33532,It's possible that there was less than the necessary amount of oversight. That's still being looked into.
33534,We got everything in hand here. You aren't needed 'round here.
33540,You're getting pretty good at this dragon-fighting business.
33541,May the crags fail to trip your feet.
33544,"You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An unfortunate misunderstanding, no more. Cold mead, hot tempers... these things happen."
33546,"Guards are free to search your room. Uh, just keep that in mind."
33547,"Please, I don't have anything to eat."
33548,It is long since one of the living has entered here. May Shor's favor follow you and your errand.
33550,Now where did I put that shipment of forks...
33553,It was Mara that first gave birth to all of creation and pledged to watch over us as her children.
33555,"If you need anything else, just ask."
33557,"Five, four, three, two, one... go!"
33559,You're putting your hand... in my pocket? Have you gone complete cracked?
33560,"You, my dear, can earn the Blessing of Dibella. You'll find men to be more pliable in the future... or more vulnerable."
33561,Honestly? I have no idea. But I've looked all over and the kidnappings here started around when she disappeared. So I have to hope...
33562,"Take care, dearie."
33563,The enemy is mustering for a final attack.
33564,I have records I need to tend to.
33566,Take care.
33568,"Yes, I was bored talking to you anyway."
33569,I have work to do.
33571,Need a room? Don't worry. Nightmares don't seem to happen for travelers.
33574,"Yeah, yeah."
33575,I should get back to work. Money doesn't count itself.
33576,"Please, let me know if it seems safe to leave."
33578,You'd have to be pretty desperate to want to make a home in this dank hole.
33579,"No, no. Goodness, no!"
33580,Need to get back to chopping.
33582,Come back when you need more meat. Bring gold.
33584,It can make life difficult when one's colleagues fail to recognize the research one engages in.
33585,"This isn't about me paying Iddra back, this is about me being able to pay her back with my own coin."
33586,What are you people doing outside? Go home. Now!
33587,Come back if you need a new ring or necklace.
33588,"Just yesterday, I saw a musician in the street playing a flute. It was... beautiful. I want that flute."
33589,"Elgrim, honey. I'm concerned about your new pupil. She seems very... odd."
33590,Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though you start first.
33591,There is no distinction between debate and combat to a dragon. Tinvaak los grah. For us it is one and the same.
33592,I have something amazing to show you that demands your attention!
33594,"If there's anything I can help you with, you have but to ask."
33598,Already done.
33600,You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
33601,Joor mey! What are you doing back there?
33602,"I still can't hold nothin' down, but it's better than yesterday."
33603,"Hey look, a cave. Wonder what's inside?"
33607,The scent of victory is on the wind.
33608,A Dwemer city. The lost people. The heretics.
33611,"Alright, get the crown off that draugr!"
33613,"Anyway, you know the drill. You want to buy back in, and it'll cost you."
33615,I wondered if I could ask a favor of you.
33616,"As the sun ends the night, end the darkness of this soul, return life to the creature you see before you!"
33618,This civil war is taking its toll on all of us. Miners are some of the hardest hit.
33621,We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.
33623,Why? Why do you pursue me?
33625,"Come, Dovahkiin. Nin Yol. Strike me with the fire of your Thu'um."
33626,I used to live in Valenwood working at my father's winery... we made the finest wine to ever cross your lips I promise you.
33628,I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.
33629,"If you're looking for a room, you want the Four Shields."
33631,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
33632,Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...
33634,Thank you! You'll find the ruins right here.
33635,Hmph. Music tames the most savage beasts. Even Nords.
33638,Don't look at me. I didn't kill her. I was just... making sure the body got buried.
33639,"You will pay for Malyn's death, Azura worshipper!"
33641,"Wait, before you go..."
33644,Gah! Quit throwing your garbage everywhere.
33646,Talk to Babette about potions. She's the creepy little girl - can't miss her. 
33647,"Rules, is it, Tsavani? I didn't realize that eating Moon Sugar was permitted."
33656,"Now, it's time to get your feet wet and I don't want to waste a lot of time talking about anything but business."
33658,"In a sense, but no more poisoned than a fool after too much wine."
33659,We must move quickly to prevent further violence.
33661,But you said that was impossible.
33669,"Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing."
33670,Is it much further to the sanctuary?
33671,Or you could catch the carriage from Whiterun to Markarth and then approach from the west.
33672,No time for idle chatter. Mercer is awaiting your presence.
33674,Are you all right? Can you walk?
33675,"Let's see... found the Dragon Cult... laid siege... people already dead... poisoned themselves... blah, blah, blah...  ah! Here it is!"
33677,Aiiiiiiieeeeeeee!!
33679,Vacation is where the head is. That is what Dervenin told us about our master. He's cozy in his Solitude.
33682,They thought I was some other Redguard woman! They just wouldn't leave me alone. I hope they get lost in the wilderness.
33684,We've got to stay focused.
33685,You have it! The blessed Wabbajack! You must use it on me. You must.
33686,Me.
33687,"Afraid not. But if you're serious about sharpening that tongue, you might try the Bard's College in Solitude."
33688,"Ah. Well. After a little incident with a roguish lad and the daughter of a prominent Thane... Well, let's just say, best not."
33691,Don't you see? Fate has led you to me and to the pieces. Dagon has to answer our call. We're so close.
33697,"Very good, Aia. Class, observe her finger movements. Let's try a few more pieces."
33702,Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that Dawnstar is not to be trifled with.
33704,Not much. I came here a few years ago from Hammerfell when I married.
33705,Those who've been under the effect of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their minds entirely.
33707,Yeah?
33708,"So enters Maven Black-Briar, the glint of Imperial coin in her eyes. So tell me, what's the price for a woman's integrity these days?"
33709,I'll speak to the Jarl and see what I can do. Just keep them at bay a little longer.
33712,But of course! Tell her she'll have it. Maven is one of the few people I can trust and I'd be delighted to give her my blessing.
33714,"You can only store white souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic won't allow black souls to enter it."
33715,"By inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house."
33716,You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!
33718,"Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha."
33719,I believe I've made myself rather clear.
33720,Look what you've made me do!
33721,"You! You'll help me! You help people, right? That's what you do?"
33722,I can take the pieces back to my museum. Seal them in a display case.
33725,Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way.
33726,Fine. I'm not dying without a fight!
33730,Thank you. Here's your gold. I'll make a run for it back to Dawnstar.
33733,"He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home."
33734,"Oh, I... I'm sorry. I just can't... you'll have to speak to my husband."
33735,"I never thought all I would want is peace and quiet, but I think our little adventure scared me straight."
33736,"Well, your bounty is low... All right, get out of my sight. But you're known to me now, scum. Remember that."
33738,"Are you mad? Apologize, or I will gut you like a horker."
33739,Good to see you in my museum again. I owe you my life.
33740,It is a fine day to work the mines.
33741,"Have you met my father? He was the steward, up at Dragonsreach when Balgruuf was Jarl."
33742,The museum is doing well. I haven't told anyone about the... incident with the Razor.
33743,"I believe she's trying to look as ravishing as possible for you, milord."
33746,Now be gone.
33747,M'aiq is done talking.
33749,"M'aiq knows many things, no?"
33750,Don't try blocking if you have two weapons. You will only get confused.  Much better to hit twice anyway.
33752,Good to talk to a fellow traveler.
33754,"Speak with Miss Salma, if you wish to speak."
33755,Why do soldiers bother with target practice? One learns best by hitting real people.
33756,M'aiq has heard the people of Skyrim are better looking than the ones in Cyrodiil. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.
33757,"I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid."
33758,Something strange happens to Khajiit when they arrive in Skyrim.
33759,Good. Now shut up and get out of my face.
33760,M'aiq was soul trapped once. Not very pleasant. You should think about that once in a while.
33761,M'aiq is very practical. He has no need for mysticism.
33762,"Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? Have you come to commune with Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord?"
33763,"Yes, but don't try to use force! He's far too mighty. He'd crush you like a clay doll, or drop you from the sky, or simply eat your brain right up!"
33764,Nords are so serious about beards. So many beards. M'aiq thinks they wish they had glorious manes like Khajiit.
33765,There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.
33767,M'aiq loves the people of Skyrim. Many interesting things they say to each other. 
33768,Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?
33772,Songs are just old memories that help the mead go down quicker.
33773,Legate!
33776,You're in it deep... better start shoveling your way out.
33777,M'aiq can travel fast across the land. Some lazy types take carriages. It is all the same to M'aiq.
33778,"Once M'aiq got in trouble in Riften, and fled to Windhelm. It is good that nobody there cared. "
33780,Snow falls. Why worry where it goes? M'aiq thinks the snowflakes are pretty. 
33781,You would not come all this way for tinvaak with an old dovah. No. You seek your weapon against Alduin.
33782,Werebears? Where? Bears? Men that are bears? 
33784,"Dragons were never gone. They were just invisible and very, very quiet."
33786,"What does this mean, to combine magic? Magic plus magic is still magic. "
33787,"Looks like it's really happening. A peace council, attended by both Ulfric and Tullius, up on High Hrothgar. Maybe there's hope for Skyrim yet."
33788,What are you doing down here?
33789,"Hear about the little Imperial boy, Aventus Aretino? The stupid whelp is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood..."
33790,How does anyone know there was a city of Winterhold? M'aiq did not see it with his eyes. Did you?
33793,"It's up to her, isn't it?"
33794,That crown must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
33796,Think he worked down at the smelter. Lot of the laborers there are sympathetic to the Forsworn.
33798,"Yes, yes. Goodbye."
33799,"I don't understand how paper will help the dregs of this city, but suit yourself."
33800,Um. Yeah.
33802,Men who understand one another need not waste words.
33803,"M'aiq's father was also called M'aiq. As was M'aiq's father's father. At least, that's what his father said."
33805,"I simply need more pieces of Dwemer equipment to study. It's nothing dangerous... At least, not necessarily."
33807,"Walkin' never hurt nobody. If you change your mind, I'll be here."
33808,Faida came by today. She says you left the tavern last night without paying for your drinks.
33810,"See that you do. You're an embarrassment, Horgeir. I don't know why I married you."
33811,I'm thinking of going for a walk up the mountain later. Would you like to come?
33813,"Oh, that sounds nice. Yes, I think I'll join you."
33814,"He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of Skyrim."
33815,A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains.
33816,"One of these days, we'll have to find you a good woman like my Olda."
33817,"Cheers, my friend! May your adventures find you fame and fortune!"
33818,Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding.
33819,"Yes, it's a great shame. Gods willing, I'll find someone just like her one day."
33820,"Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious."
33822,Thus we must take certain precautions in order to secure our safety.
33824,You've been working hard lately. You'll make a fine innkeeper someday.
33825,I presume you have something important to say?
33827,If the Nine are willing!
33829,"Miss Faida, may I ask you a question?"
33830,"Of course, Julienne. What's on your mind?"
33831,What do you do when a customer can't afford to pay for a meal or a drink?
33832,Did I tell you I got a letter from General Tullius? They've conscripted some more archers and will need...
33833,"Since my customers are mostly local, I just knock on their front doors the next day."
33835,You look strong.
33836,"Still shaken from all the fighting, my friend. It's been too long since I had to kill someone."
33837,This kind of work suits you... and is going to end up makin' you rich.
33840,This is fun.
33843,Thank you again for all the help.
33845,"Because they've got Thorald locked away somewhere, and if they find me here I'll disappear too!"
33848,"The Kelle... Elder Scrolls, as you name them, they have often been used for prophecy. Yes, your prophecy comes from an Elder Scroll."
33851,"Uh, yes ma'am."
33857,And lose out just when the going is getting good? No thanks.
33859,"Grelka, have you had anyone come by and try to sell you an iron war axe?"
33860,"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
33866,"Well, look at us, getting married. Life in Skyrim ain't all bad, huh?"
33869,But I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.
33870,Hmm. Yes. They are very protective of me. Bahlaan fahdonne.
33871,And what might that be?
33873,"But, I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me."
33874,Where is papa? I want to ride Karinda now!
33875,"Did you spot the Dwarven ruins up there? Mzinfazzle, Finchafft, Mzinchaleft? Good thing the Dwarves disappeared and stopped naming things."
33876,Ow! What did I do?
33877,Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and Dovahkiin return together.
33878,"Now that we know they're tied in to some sort of necromantic ritual, I think I know when the next might occur."
33879,Come on!
33881,"Hmph. You wear that armor well. Iron may be simple, but it'll stop enough to keep you in the fight."
33882,Maven Black-Briar always remembers her friends. That's why I'm in charge of the place.
33886,"Listen, wench, we're on to you. We know who you are, so you'd better come with us right now!"
33888,"Brother, I think she's telling the truth..."
33890,"Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting to pick that up. Poor Kerah, such a patient woman."
33891,I'm not going anywhere.  Now back off before I do something drastic.
33892,What? Oh... you're right.
33896,"You bested me, an Orc chief. Impressive."
33897,I got mine off of a merchant ship in Solitude. Worst mistake I ever made.
33898,"Greetings, mother. "
33899,Don't go to the Blue Palace. The master is on vacation. Don't listen to Dervenin. Don't do it.
33900,By Ysmir! There's a killer about.
33901,Anything else before you make the journey?
33903,"Don't bother me, peasant. I've had a long journey and paid too much coin on these gifts to be late to Vittoria's wedding."
33906,Indeed. If we ever get there.
33907,You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief.
33911,You're free to use those powers as you see fit to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.
33912,It's not like my poaching is hurting anyone. The Jarl can hardly eat every deer now can he?
33914,"The life of adventure and song is the life for us, eh friend?"
33915,But there must be more to it than that. Did something... strange... happen when the dragon died?
33916,You both agree to this?
33917,There's someone that wants to see him put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know.
33919,"No, how did you find me? Just give me more time, I can pay Maven back!"
33920,"You! You must have told Maven about the horse. If you'd just stuck to the plan, I wouldn't be in this mess."
33922,What? You dare challenge Ma'randru-jo? You will suffer for your insolence!
33923,"This has nothing to do with you, so back off."
33924,It's the damn outlanders and Empire that need the reasons.
33927,"Reasons? Since when does a man need a reason to protect his family, to defend his homeland?"
33929,Enough talk. There's much to do.
33930,The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
33934,I fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion. I bled and spilt blood for the Empire. And for what?
33935,Not this Empire. The world's better without it. Certainly Skyrim is.
33936,What... what happened?
33937,Here. For you. For my hatchling of the heart.
33939,And last is the soul gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.
33940,Someone take out that mage!
33941,Come on. Put the weapon away. You're making people nervous.
33942,At least the damned war hasn't gotten here. Yet.
33944,Hrm.
33946,"I am a loyal citizen of the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps."
33947,"And finally, there's Colette. She may be... difficult to get along with, she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic."
33949,The rebels are only inflaming the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its ultimate aim.
33951,"Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion."
33953,"If that's all, there's pressing concerns that need dealing with."
33960,What I am doing is none of your business!
33965,Archer in that tower!
33971,Don't leave any of them alive.
33977,"You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, brother."
33978,And would you raise a mug in his name?
33979,But...
33980,Make 'em bleed.
33983,"Your blood is ours, Companion!"
33984,The beasts return!
33986,Just play along.
33989,"All right, that's far enough. You know how this works- toll here is 100 gold."
33990,Are you done? Did you just come here to make speeches? Or can we get down to business?
33991,"I've no idea what killed her, but I'm sure something did."
33992,"You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let him prove it."
33993,"Don't play dumb with me. Pay up, and you walk right through. Refuse, and you'll never see the other side."
33996,"I swear, those scheming elves charge us twice what anyone else would pay."
33997,"You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best."
33998,"If I had been smarter, I would have kept my boat. Coming to this city was a big mistake."
33999,Get a move on.
34002,"Are you the assassin? From the...? Well, there's this Traveling Dignitary, in Solitude. I need her... you know. This gold will cover it, right?"
34003,"Here, have one on me."
34005,Paarthurnax was the author of many atrocities during the Dragon War - crimes great enough to be remembered for thousands of years.
34006,Some are too happy to fight. Blood runs hot.
34007,Do you know the way? I'm weary and lost.
34008,"Hmm... looks like it's all here. Okay, go on through. But stick to the road, and don't make any sudden moves."
34010,"Please, just go away!"
34012,Khajiit is always watching for thieves and pickpockets.
34015,"Not my problem. You want through here, you pay. Or else."
34017,"I hear Mara has sent one of her priests to the inn to try to calm people down, but I don't know how much words will do now."
34018,"Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any... residual energies. Alive or undead."
34022,"Not a chance. Get'em, boys!"
34025,I'm quite busy. Need something or can I get back to work?
34026,Do you have it?
34029,"I'll give them a proper burial, then head back. Come find me if you're ever in Falkreath. You'll always be welcome at my door."
34033,"To Riften, my pet. How you'll adore the city."
34036,"We tracked a bear to this den. Good coin for those pelts. We had the big sow cornered when they showed up. Three of them, out of nowhere."
34039,Somebody get that fool a blanket.
34041,You ask why I'm so fascinated? The irony... the irony that the same world that gave us life provides us the means to die.
34042,When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
34043,At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.
34045,It's late outlander. Come back in the morning if you need to spend coin.
34048,"Gold, silver. Gems, maybe? Only one way to find out!"
34049,"And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire."
34050,"But, there's one they fear."
34052,"In their tongue, he is Dovahkiin."
34053,Dragonborn.
34056,"Well, Sabjorn. Now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?"
34057,"Careful here, there's a trick to this. Trick is to not bleed to death. Ah, and there's a lever, too."
34058,Raagh!
34059,"If you actually want to get out alive, I'd bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly."
34060,All hail to Ulfric! You are the High King! In your great honor we drink and we sing.
34062,"Hey Ton, you shouldn't cheat on Vekel. He's a good guy."
34063,Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.
34065,"I don't know where you find your sources, but that last shipment of skooma was some of the best quality I've seen in years."
34067,"I'm strong, and quick, and can do any chore you want. Come on, adopt me. Please?"
34068,"I don't know if I've ever seen any of those before. I've heard about them, though. Sorry, can't help you."
34073,"Never mind then, lass. If you change your mind, come find me."
34074,I just got lucky is all. Bumped into someone who knew someone else. The rest just writes itself.
34075,If you like I'd be happy to take it over the operation for you. Take the source off your hands.
34076,This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.
34077,At least you remembered to bring me the information I requested. Give me that.
34078,It'll make for a better song.
34080,This way.
34081,You'll never leave Markarth!
34082,"My boy, he always did have an eye for the pretty ones. That Vittoria ain't bad, for an Imperial."
34083,"Had they placed their faith in magic instead of machinery, the Dwemer might still be around."
34084,Maven sent word that you discovered something else while you were out there. Something important to the Guild?
34085,"But, I suppose, if it does actually turn out to be worth something, let me know, will you?"
34086,...gonna start keepin' a knife in my boot... tired of gettin' disarmed...
34088,Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works.
34089,Good.
34091,What's taking them so long? Did they get lost? Let's get this over with already.
34093,"And for their bloody sacrifices, the Dragons gifted their priests with terrible power."
34094,Aggh!
34095,Rragh!
34098,Fear the Thalmor!
34099,Only true Imperials request that one.
34100,Today is a good day to die.
34101,"You are bold, wunduniik. You dare enter a Dovah's home without permission."
34102,Markarth is off the table. Your rabble is on the verge of defeat. We have no need of a truce at such a price.
34103,Changed your mind? Come with me. I'm heading to Riverwood. It's just up the road and my uncle Alvor is the blacksmith there.
34104,"Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves."
34108,"On your knees, worm!"
34110,My advice? Serve your time at the pickaxe and get out. You don't want to end up getting a shiv in the guts over a bottle of Skooma.
34113,"Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel."
34114,"Oh my, a guest!"
34116,You are no true Elf!
34117,We should really get to court.
34118,Filthy... barbarian!
34119,Arrggh!
34121,"Excellent, I needed some more kindling for my kitchen hearth."
34122,Rragh!
34123,The laboratory adjoins the library. I'm hoping we'll find a sample of the Torpor left undamaged.
34124,No.
34125,The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?
34127,Not enough to outweigh the loss of Riften. The whole south of Eastmarch would be open to Imperial attack.
34129,Nyagh!
34130,"You're playing a dangerous game, my friend."
34131,I am as my father Akatosh made me. As are you... Dovahkiin.
34132,I suppose if you're truly interested you could talk to Falk. He's the better-safe-than-sorry type.
34133,Ruh!
34134,Enchanting services are one of the few things that keep us in touch with the rest of Skyrim.
34135,This brilliant soul decided to pick a fight with a fellow Guild mate. Time for them to pay the piper. Will you help out?
34136,Join the dead!
34137,Praise Kynareth for allowing such beauty in the world.
34138,The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!
34141,Your shroud awaits!
34143,The elements are mine to command!
34145,Behold my power!
34146,Hssssss!
34147,Jolly good guess!
34148,Thank you. I knew you'd understand.
34149,"Bleed for me, mortal!"
34150,For the Reach!
34151,Forsworn forever!
34152,"Old habits don't die easily, and we Nords can be as stubborn as stone."
34153,Gonna rip you... open!
34156,Good luck to you.
34157,Whatcha gonna do? Huh? Whatcha gonna do?
34158,Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...
34159,Die already so I can take your stuff!
34160,"There's an Altmer who's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Nelacar. You should speak with him, if you're so curious."
34162,Is it true that you refused to sell one of your... trinkets to Hemming?
34164,"Go ahead, try and fight back!"
34165,To worry about the hereafter means losing sight of the now.
34168,Need to get going. What is it?
34170,"If you remember to use your Voice in service to the purpose of Akatosh, you will remain true to the Way."
34172,Need a new blade?
34174,"She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head."
34177,Fine.
34179,"You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift."
34180,I'm one of miners. Plenty of ore to dig up around here.
34181,"I keep to myself. I offer spells and scrolls to those who need them, and wisdom in Conjuration magic for those who wish to learn."
34182,"People have forgotten humor, poetry and romance. I love a good sword fight as much as the next man, but there's more to life."
34183,"Ah, Viarmo.  I assume you are here to petition for the reinstatement of the Burning of King Olaf Festival."
34184,Did you read that letter from Markarth yet?
34185,"Please, will you help me? There's no one here I can trust."
34188,And how is that old warrior doing these days?
34189,Been a while since I've seen you at the meadery. Bring me anything interesting?
34190,Just a... scratch!
34195,"As do I. That man saved my life. I hope that someone helps him, as he once helped me."
34197,Do you have Gallus's Journal?
34198,"Without birth there is no life, without death there is only stasis. Such is the truth of Arkay."
34199,"Papa says I'm not old enough yet, so I help out by patrolling the town with Lucky here."
34200,"Your father's too easy on you, boy. I'd have you cutting wood at dawn if you were my son."
34201,"It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested."
34202,Fo...
34203,"Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure. Something unique, let's say."
34204,It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for it to be well guarded. I wonder why...
34206,Probably for the best. It will give me time to see if that old trap still works - and break the news to the men.
34207,"The local Nords may not like us very much, but they don't seem to mind having access to enchanted weapons and armor."
34209,Winterhold might yet thrive if that College had never been built.
34210,Although now it looks like you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.
34216,"As long as the Synod don't blame us for this mess, I have more pressing matters to deal with."
34217,I warned them it might be dangerous. It's not my fault they didn't listen.
34220,If that's what it will take then so be it.
34222,Wuld!
34224,The sort of embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.
34225,I believe I've heard it said that it's the only thing that could adequately contain his power.
34226,I think this is yet another conversation that wouldn't make your wife happy.
34228,I'm lucky to have a man that is so devoted to me.
34229,I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways... they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them.
34231,"Oh, very well. But my energies are low. I warn you - I won't be able to see much. Give me... five gold, and I'll do what I can."
34232,"It would seem I'm bound to this place. The bitter irony of it all -- my greatest failure, and even in death I can't escape it."
34233,But now it all comes out again...
34234,Shouldn't leave things around to trip over...
34235,"It was Atmah's idea to come here, at first. She talked me into it, and I convinced the others."
34236,"You poor thing. You should come by the temple, speak to Maramal."
34238,"I'll get back to court business, then."
34239,"One moment we joked about what we'd find below, the next he'd been ripped in half."
34240,I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets.
34241,You speak to Igmund. Son of Hrolfdir. Jarl of Markarth.
34242,"Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have big teeth?"
34243,"Sometimes I miss the soldier's life, but when I hold my daughter in my arms, I know I made the right choice."
34244,"When it was over, Atmah, Hafnar and I stared, pale-faced, at one another, unwilling to admit we'd made a terrible mistake."
34247,"I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!"
34248,"Well, now. That's something to think about."
34249,Take this as a token of our gratitude.
34250,At least I've chosen a side instead of acting like a spectator.
34252,We could have turned back. It could have ended there. But we kept going.
34253,"Elvali died here. I don't even remember what killed her. One of the countless faceless horrors. I think she was glad, in that final moment."
34254,You'll die knowing it was the Blades that sent you to Oblivion.
34255,"Hafnar was covered in blood, but his stupid Nord pride wouldn't let him admit defeat."
34256,I've taken to hiring a few extra men of my own just to keep up with all the shipments.
34258,"They've grown, all right - lazier and more stupid."
34259,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
34261,"Good, got a buyer in a rush for this item. If you hurry we can turn it around and make a quick profit. Can you get it?"
34262,"Another incident? I must say, I'm disappointed."
34267,We're finally going to arrest the Butcher.
34269,Give me just one... little... bite!
34270,"If you'll stand back, I'll perform the ritual granted to me by Lady Mara."
34278,"Now you've put it all to rest, but it can't undo my mistakes. They can never be undone..."
34279,The stories don't say why the dwarves disappeared. I wonder if their machines turned on them.
34280,There is no more life here.
34281,"Yes, well so do I. That's why I was hoping you could help."
34283,I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea what you're speaking of.
34286,"Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?"
34287,"But, if confronted with proof of his belief, you might be able to ""persuade"" him to aid our cause, indirectly of course."
34291,"Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with."
34292,I can't believe we're doing this.
34293,"My sister and I both work for the Nords. Our brother is ashamed of us, but at least we can affort to eat."
34294,Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?
34295,"This machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then... I'm not sure. Split it, somehow?"
34299,"Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets themselves -- who knows what we could find!"
34303,And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?
34306,We... we have to go back. We can't leave Girduin...
34313,"Oh, pardon me. Was I in your way? "
34314,"We barely made it out alive, and you want to go back in?"
34317,We can't go back. Might as well go forward. We can still do this.
34318,"You can help yourself to any drink you find, but bring me the bottle of Dragon's Breath Mead. It's his favorite, so I know he has one there."
34319,"What was that thing, anyway?"
34323,Who in their right mind would be stupid enough to pay you to steal from Maven?
34324,"Sigh. What is it now, dear?"
34325,"Wilhelm said he saw you speaking to one of the pilgrims on the 7,000 Steps. I told you that I didn't want you to go up there."
34326,Just don't expect us to at your back when Maven has your head on the executioner's block.
34328,This is worse than I thought...
34329,"Look, this sounds like a family matter and I don't want the Guild in the middle of it. You do what you want."
34332,Typical Nord. Beard for brains.
34334,"Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them."
34337,"Have you? All good, I trust. But you have me at a disadvantage. I'm afraid I know nothing about you..."
34338,"So Sibbi finally got the nerve to bare his teeth, eh?"
34339,Have our scouts come up with any information on these reports of dragons?
34341,And here I thought you were a master criminal. Guess I was wrong.
34342,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Whiterun.
34343,Aye. She's by the fire.
34344,Guess I should have known. Maven and Sibbi have been at odds ever since she had him tossed into jail.
34345,I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true.
34347,"I don't care, but my ancestors do. You can't have it."
34348,"...I'm sorry, friends. I'm so sorry!"
34352,"You have no business here, so keep walking."
34353,"This is not over, I assure you."
34354,"But I doubt many will wish to exchange Alduin's lordship for the tyranny of Paarthurnax's ""Way of the Voice""."
34356,"Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house, just don't hurt anyone."
34359,"""If we can just make it through, it'll all be worth it"", I told them. And the fools believed the words I myself didn't trust."
34360,Climb down that ledge and see if you can...
34361,"If you can sneak into their camp and steal her plans, we'll have the advantage."
34364,We've been contacted by the Jarl of Morthal.
34366,I can't believe I just met the Gourmet!
34370,"Healthy and strong. Ysgramor's coat's gotten so thick, he looks fat!"
34371,"Lorkhan's eyes, do I have to do everything myself? Get back to Riften before the Thalmor find him!"
34372,"It is the Champion of Namira! I was just about to eat. Here, you should have the first bite."
34377,"He is also a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone, and Vighar escaped."
34378,"Ah, there you are. Good, I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway. We've got some business to discuss."
34380,A citizen of Skyrim has asked for our help.
34383,"No. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame."
34384,Good. He will have fled to gather others of his kind.
34385,This work isn't for everyone. Maybe you're more cut out for those snowberries up in Winterhold.
34386,"By Ysmir, I feel... invincible!"
34387,I expected too much. I'll seek someone else to salvage the family honor.
34388,Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.
34390,Next thing you know there will be some kind of damn blight and undead will walk the land.
34391,Got a lot of nerve coming down here. People tend to get hurt in the Ratway.
34393,The Sybil of Dibella spends her entire life in direct communion with the goddess.
34394,"Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil."
34396,You can still run. It's not too late.
34397,We don't take kindly to people snooping around our business.
34401,"She's here? By Sithis, I thought we'd lost her. Let's go!"
34405,"In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it."
34408,"I don't know, Babette. Looks like she may have suffered a head wound. Best not let her out of our sight..."
34410,Agh!
34411,You'd better get to Riften. Talk to Brynjolf. He's... well-connected. A good starting point at least.
34415,I'm beginning to think leaving Mournhold was a mistake.
34416,"Fortunately, I persevered and the other groups were either killed or they left Skyrim."
34417,"All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no."
34418,"I spent thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but it was as if she had simply vanished... like I said before, she was the best."
34420,The infighting had taken months to subside which gave her time to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks.
34421,Why are you here? Killing Gaius Maro is but the first step of your contract - you must also plant the incriminating letter on his body...
34422,I believe King Olaf's verse will provide that proof.
34423,I'm in mourning. Can't you see that?
34425,You're quite noisy for someone who claims to be a thief.
34427,The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent.
34430,What's this?
34431,You know that our supply is limited. It could be a season or more before we get a new shipment from the south.
34432,You always brighten my day a little. Here. I hope you like this.
34433,"My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had a clear shot."
34439,"If you're going to need live test subjects for your experiments, it's easier to do that off of College grounds."
34440,"Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue. I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless."
34441,"You're pretty, I'll give ya that. Just stay away from my husband, Alvor."
34443,"Falion is the only one I know who is public about what he does. He was once my teacher here, but left the College years ago."
34445,With this the world could have a better understanding of the Dwemer! 
34448,We can get better acquainted once the ceremony's ended.
34452,"It's said to be spread across four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you."
34453,"Here. I want you to accept this as payment for your sacrifice and I... well, we both thank you."
34457,"Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal from Gallus's remains. I suspect the information we need is written inside."
34458,Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. It.... I....
34460,You're dumb.
34461,It's the only outsider Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his Nightingale identity.
34462,Enthir... Gallus's friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course...
34463,Did you make something bad happen?
34464,"I see. Then there's nothing further to discuss. If you change your mind, speak with the Legate."
34465,"Perhaps I'll tell you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold with the journal and get the translation."
34466,"I can't believe Silus is collecting Mythic Dawn artifacts. Right here in Dawnstar, no less."
34467,Every day the threat of exile from Riften draws closer for myself and my family.
34469,"If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you sister."
34470,"Did you ever have to fight off bandits, Frida? Like in your stories?"
34472,Gah!
34473,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
34474,How'd I do?
34476,Looking to fix your armor?
34477,Arise! Arise and defend us!
34479,There's a gorgeous tree that grows right up through a cave to the northeast of here.
34480,"Ah, yes. That scabbard. Notice the insignia? An Oblivion Gate. A key symbol of Mehrunes Dagon, the patron Daedra of the Mythic Dawn."
34482,"Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for."
34485,Magic? You're on the wrong side of Skyrim. You want Winterhold... that College there. They teach it.
34486,Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials.
34487,I have a collection of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire. Their importance to history cannot be forgotten.
34488,"Yes, sir."
34490,"What's there to say? You go against the Empire, you wind up dead. Thorald got what was coming to him."
34493,"I'll see everyone in Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in our hands, for good or ill."
34494,But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied.
34495,"Yes. Do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting."
34496,"Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it... less so."
34497,"We mostly carry herbs and alchemical ingredients, that sort of thing. Before the war, our stock was mostly used for aromatic use in homes, yes."
34498,That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right...
34499,Another new student... I'm surprised at how many of you there are lately.
34500,"Well, then. Repeat after me."
34501,"If you meet him, don't expect much in the way o' conversation. He ain't one for talking, especially with folk he don't know."
34503,Here's the situation. You attacked my family. So now you're going to apologize.. or I'm going to kill you. I hope we understand each other...
34504,"The objective here is simple, you simpleton!  Use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy, while they do the same! "
34505,"Kind of nice being in on the secret, itsn't it."
34507,"With the threat gone Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've helped him... sort of. And we're that much closer to home."
34508,"And now, thanks to you, the city is back under the Empire's banner."
34510,The lady's already paid the fee. We leave when she gives the word.
34511,Are we close? Thalmor spies could be anywhere.
34515,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
34516,"I'd rather not tangle with her right now. Let's try to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step."
34517,Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.
34518,All you need to do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his terrors easy to repel... but persistent. 
34519,"Ho, Gorm."
34520,"Don't get too comfortable here, mortal. You may actually earn your way out."
34521,Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself... and continue hating everyone else. 
34522,That was hardly worth my time.
34526,"Hail, sister! I saw you walking there and thought you could use this."
34527,"My position, ""Dean of History,"" actually covers a wide range of subjects. I teach poetry, writing, history, and the finer points of court life."
34528,"Hail, brother! I saw you walking there and thought you might need this."
34529,"Please hold still, and don't move."
34535,"Well. I, uh, can see you're not one to be trifled with. Let this be a warning to you!"
34537,"Yes, actually. You look like you're lousy with gold."
34538,You cannot take this away from me!
34540,"I'm just as puzzled as you, lad."
34543,The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery.
34546,"Of course you cannot. No one can. It is my lot as Chief of this tribe, and so I suffer quietly."
34548,"But before we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion. "
34550,Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the temple.
34551,Got him!
34553,The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.
34555,"I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims."
34556,You want a fight? You got it.
34559,Some say I got my position because my cousin is the Emperor. Nonsense. The man's given me nothing. He can't even be bothered to attend my wedding.
34560,"Even if all you've said here is lies, I know you have something in Winterhold the Synod Council will be very interested in."
34561,"So, mage from Winterhold, despite your intentions I've beaten your little game."
34562,I think I've discovered more here than I could've hoped to.
34564,Meet us here when you're ready. 
34565,Am I? Am I?
34566,"We're backing Erikur. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing."
34570,You are new here. I don't trust the new.
34573,"I know of a ship coming in from Hammerfell. Some cargo might get ""lost""..."
34575,"Oh, yes. A secret family recipe. The only good thing my father Octieve ever did. In fact, it's so good, no one else in Skyrim even tries to make any."
34577,But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that.
34578,Ha! Humor is often in short supply here.
34579,"My understanding is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic."
34582,We're liberating Morthal. Join the brothers gathering for the attack. Talos be with you.
34583,"Listen, when you're finished with this Emperor business, meet Babette and me there. I'll find some way to move the Night Mother. Don't worry. Now go!"
34585,"I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?"
34590,"You, too, huh? I'd take a straight fight with the whole Legion over creeping around a place like this."
34591,I'll deal with my uncle. Just... go! Scour this place from top to bottom!
34592,You've found the vessels. I worried that I had sent you to your death.
34593,This should be good.
34595,I would be most impressed to see that.
34596,"I'm waiting on word about reinforcements for the fort... Good, they're on the way. And we have some information on enemy troop movements. Excellent."
34597,My wife is in mourning and I need to get back to her soon. I'd be much obliged if you could take this to Aela for me.
34600,I think there is much that we can learn from each other.
34601,"You, however, should press on. See if you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is truly dangerous, be careful."
34602,"Normally you'd need to show some aptitude with one of the schools of magic, but you..."
34603,So the stories are true... you are Dragonborn!
34605,That's for the best.
34606,Excellent.
34607,I'm afraid your skills haven't improved enough to be considered.
34609,Charmed.
34610,"I'll lead you across the bridge. Once you're inside you'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine, our Master Wizard. Please, follow me."
34611,Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.
34612,I trained our daughter Lilija as a healer... to one day tend the Shrine of Talos and replace me as a Priestess of Talos.
34613,And most of us are quite satisfied with that.
34615,The feast has begun!
34616,"I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit."
34620,I've tried to convince her the festival is many centuries old and celebrates Solitude but I need proof.
34621,"I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal."
34623,Stay where you are. The mother will deal with you.
34624,"You? You are nothing. An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze."
34625,Here she is. 
34626,"This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial. Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion."
34629,"If that's how you choose to end your life, so be it."
34633,"Now, come with me, child. We'll prepare you for the goddess's presence."
34635,Very good.
34636,"Maybe you could help find it, I just know it's in here."
34638,Do I make myself clear?
34640,You're out of your league!
34641,This is your last mistake!
34643,"Take care, and go with the blessings of the Eight."
34645,This is just like old times.
34647,"Hmm, it's encrypted.  It'll take a while to figure this out."
34648,And here's a little something for helping me out.
34649,Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for you.
34651,"I hope Vignar doesn't find them. He'll ask a king's ransom, I'm sure."
34652,"I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen."
34653,"Read carefully. You will see there are ways to stay true to the essence, Illdi."
34657,I hope we reach Markarth soon.
34660,Ingun? She's brilliant; a natural!
34671,"Narfi's sad now. Still wait for Reyda. No more sleep. No, no... no."
34674,Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were.
34676,"I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough gold to pay for that."
34678,Healing spells always leave me light-headed...
34680,I'm very dangerous! Don't make me come out there and hurt you!
34683,"Through there is... Hag's End. The last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you."
34685,"Farengar! Enough, fool!"
34686,"My joints ache, I can't eat nothin' and my head feels like a furnace. I've seen better days."
34689,And now Silus is back and this museum to the Mythic Dawn is his way of trying to rebuild his family's pride. It's misguided.
34690,The eyes of the law are everywhere these days.
34692,"His family's involvement was only found out well after the crisis had died down, but it still ruined their reputation. They were outcasts."
34695,Not a student of history I see. It's for the best. They're a group that should be forgotten.
34696,Swift hunting.
34697,"Farewell, my lady."
34700,Tidings.
34701,"You give me too much credit. For how could I fail? I am, after all, just a little girl. What threat could I possibly pose? He he he he he."
34705,Into the dark with you!
34710,"I'd request that when speaking to Jarl Laila, you show the proper respect."
34713,"Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for."
34714,You'll serve me soon enough.
34716,"Your loss, but if you change your mind, I'll be here."
34719,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
34720,"My time is limited, so speak quickly."
34721,"Terrible shame, what happened to those women."
34722,When you're standing downwind of me.
34723,"Sorry, what was that?"
34724,Not long. They're hiding in the country side.
34726,"Tonilia, can I offer some friendly advice?"
34729,Bone-Breaker.
34730,Good work!
34731,"I'm really not in the mood. State your business, or take your leave."
34733,Why don't you just formally join up? Quit sittin' here wheelin' and dealin' when you could be out there makin' a heck of a lot more coin.
34736,"Cowards, every one of them. Running at the first sign of trouble..."
34738,Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!
34739,I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.
34740,"The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Pale, allowing Jarl Skald the Elder to return from exile."
34741,Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
34742,"Years ago, this temple was raided by an orc war party seeking revenge... they were being plagued by nightmares just like the people of Dawnstar."
34743,"Yes, sir. I'll try to contain her."
34744,Only one more door left.  Hurry up.
34745,Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!
34747,This truce with the Stormcloaks won't last a fortnight. Bloody savages will kill us while we sleep.
34748,Yes!  The path is clear!
34749,Aren't you worried someone will wander in here? The entrance isn't exactly hidden you know.
34750,One of these days he'll have to learn. 
34752,"Alduin believes that he will prevail, with good reason. Rok mul."
34754,"So, stop your worrying and get some rest. Your shift is coming up and I don't want you dozing off again like last time."
34755,Good day.
34756,I knew I heard something. What's this bridge doing down?
34757,I thought we had a guard posted outside.
34758,You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and with your own body.
34759,"If only more people would read this, things might be better in Riften."
34760,Anything?
34761,"If you're not here for the College, then you've little other reason to be in Winterhold at all."
34762,Gallus's Oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms.
34763,"These people just inherited some heirlooms from a relative. Good timing for us, bad timing for them, eh?"
34766,Don't wait for me. Get to Korvanjund as soon as you're ready. I'll meet you there.
34767,I feel better already.
34769,Where you off to? There's work to be done.
34770,"He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get him."
34771,All for some old crown? It's a strange war all right.
34773,"Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to set the rings so the door will open."
34774,You know you can afford a septim or two.
34776,"Be careful, friend. This place doesn't seem too... forgiving."
34780,"Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest..."
34781,"Look, you want to know about me? All right, I'll tell you."
34782,Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are still not acceptable.
34783,"You there. We are looking for someone in Whiterun, and will pay good money for information."
34784,"What did you need, soldier?"
34786,No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man steers clear of Stentor.
34787,Unlock that door and let's get out of here.
34790,Did you find a key? See if it unlocks that door.
34791,"Talen, do you believe what they're saying? Do you really think the dragons have returned?"
34793,"I don't know what to believe. If it's true, then dark times may be upon us."
34794,"Before I'm goin' to give you any more work, you need to finish that job in Solitude."
34795,Guards! Trespasser!
34796,"Tythis, please. The Snow-Shods are good people, but tend to exaggerate. Try and stay calm for your own sake."
34797,"Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a note. The only bit that I could read said ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun."""
34798,Thank you.
34803,That's a fine potion you've put together.
34804,That 'incident' in Morthal was just a misunderstanding. No matter what the guards claim.
34808,Do you think we could persuade one of the dragons to join our side?
34810,But just think of the advantage.
34812,I still need some time to get used to the idea that there might be hope for us after all.
34813,I don't suppose we would ever really trust the thing anyway.
34816,"Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting."
34817,Picking through garbage. Has she no shame?
34820,We have no need to negotiate when the rebels are so clearly losing the war.
34821,"Restore to me my beacon, that I might guide you toward your destiny."
34822,"In the end, vampirism would endanger my ward Agni which would defeat the intended purpose."
34823,"Captain, have you heard these stories of dragons?"
34824,"Elda, you know better than to believe every idiot traveler that wanders through."
34825,Don't worry though. It'll be relatively painless...relatively.
34826,Really? I hope it hurt.
34828,But they're saying that one of them freed Ulfric... that he's in league with them.
34829,Aaaayyyaarrrrgghh!
34830,Think about how ridiculous that sounds. Come now.
34833,"Calixto, do you know if there's any truth to these rumors of dragons?"
34834,It's a religious thing.
34836,"Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important."
34837,The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Ma'am.
34838,"Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing."
34839,Where's your precious Emperor now?
34840,"I understand, you're an important person. I'll catch up with you later."
34841,"Banning the worship of Talos was the last straw. Thalmor everywhere, dragging people off for honoring our own gods!"
34842,Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.
34843,"My wife is a good woman, but every man needs a little variety, you know?"
34845,And that's exactly what the old man wanted. I'm glad we could give it to him. 
34846,The College is a bit of an oddity in Skyrim. Magic isn't something that's looked upon fondly here.
34848,"Yeah, but raising Draugr to take on both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? That's just crazy."
34849,Well one of us has to do something!
34851,"If you had told me a few months ago that some outsider I had never heard of would lead the Companions, I might have slit your throat."
34856,"Oh, you don't have to worry about any problems from me. I do what I'm told. Congratulations!"
34858,"I'll be honest, I wouldn't have expected it."
34861,"And that, my nervous little friend, has not happened. Would you care to comment on that, perhaps?"
34862,What! What are you doing?! You fools! You cannot bind me to your wills!
34864,You gotta have better things to do than talk to me all day...
34865,Not right now. I'm going to look at some of these carvings. I wonder if Ysgramor ever set foot here while he was alive.
34868,I have enough to keep me busy. View it as a chance to hone your craft.
34870,"They've been around as long as I can remember, but only recently focused on our ships."
34873,Eventually. But this... this is the Tomb of Ysgramor. I think I'm just going to... commune for a bit.
34874,"Now that I think of it, she would have made a fine Imperial general."
34875,And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in Hircine's realm. 
34876,Damn you...
34877,"I did. Your time, it seems, has come."
34878,That they might get themselves killed. 
34879,I'd wager old Vignar could see half a dozen of my predecessors.
34887,You won't take us alive!
34890,"From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself... well... dying."
34891,"A word of advice, keep away from the Keep and the city guards. They follow their own path and have already forsaken Her."
34892,Don't leave poor Melka to die.
34893,I'll never get tired of killing these Imperial bastards.
34895,Ugh. What do you want?
34899,The orichalcum ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me.
34900,"First off, it seems that we might be able to blackmail the Jarl's Steward. I need to find out for sure."
34901,But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.
34905,Why would Tullius waste resources getting the crown only to give it to me? Poisoned perhaps? No. He's not that cunning.
34907,The Divines smile on those who show mercy an' charity.
34917,"Ah, I can't reveal all my secrets to you. But rest assured, I would know."
34919,"Getting the real sword would be even better than making a copy, but no one wants to risk getting it from its resting place."
34920,What?  My Fjola would never...
34921,Hmm. All right. Do you think... maybe we should?
34922,Everything is wrong! Everything! Whatever you have at that College has completely interfered with our work here.
34923,Go wrong? Go wrong?
34925,May the gods preserve us all.
34927,Still have quite a good bit of jobs available if you're looking for some extra coin.
34928, 
34930,"You show up here just as our work nears completion, and now I can't get any results from this because of something at your College."
34934,"Battle-Born is a name out of legend, sung in the songs of old and heard in deeds of valor for a hundred generations."
34935,"Hmmm... horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of... "
34938,"This one should be easy. Get in, plant the goods and get out. Quiet and neat. Sound like your kind of job?"
34941,"This should be lit up brighter than the night sky, and it's not! Clearly you've interfered somehow. Or..."
34942,"I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing."
34943,"The Mace of Molag Bal! I give you its true power, mortal."
34944,I get it. It's funny. It just might upset your wife.
34949,Not sure how much longer I can hold out here.
34950,Oh. Good job. Here... My way of saying thanks.
34952,"Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch."
34953,We're not supposed to talk to the guests.
34955,"Well, I was thinking... we should. We could stock all kinds of specialty items. You know, to cater to some of our more.... ""eclectic"" customers."
34956,"Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again."
34957,Guess they deserved it...
34958,"Heating and cooling the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change how the light passes through it."
34961,I was named after the sound a lion makes. You know: rrroooaaaarr! Really.
34962,"Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire."
34964,"You are in Eldergleam Sanctuary - just a small glimpse of what beauty Kynareth has to offer. Wonderful place, isn't it?"
34965,I see I still have much to learn. Lead on.
34967,"Well, now. This I hadn't considered."
34971,"So you do have something, then."
34972,"Wow! Didn't think I could get that for her. I mean, sure!"
34974, 
34977,I've never met someone like him that revels so much in other's misery.
34978,Yes. It all started when I was a boy. My father owned one of the mines. Rare for anyone who isn't a Nord.
34980,"The world's going mad, and our Jarl does what?"
34983,"Also, I doubt you'd be able to comprehend the details."
34985,All you'll accomplish by threatening them is ending up in the Riften dungeon. You're lucky they didn't take you seriously.
34986,"Are you bloody serious? You're not going to get ahead by quitting around here, that I can promise you."
34987,Let's pretend we haven't. What's Alduin's Wall and what does it have to do with stopping the dragons?
34988,"Purely to help safeguard the Empire, of course."
34989,"And yet, in the end, only two locations have been revealed to us. One is your College."
34990,Always good to see someone I can trust.
34992,"I write drama, friend. The legends and history of Skyrim made to excite and inspire."
34993,It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?
34995,"Clear Skies will blow away the mist, but only for a time."
34998,That is none of your concern.
34999,But... But you're not going to kill me. Right?
35000,Taking this man to be interrogated.
35001,"Impressive, you've mastered the shadows."
35003,Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I adore this location... we have no idea what we're going to find.
35004,"Besides, I wouldn't want to be the one to give it to him. Gives me the creeps. They say he dabbles in necromancy."
35005,"There's no time. We've got to get you out of here! Come on, let's go!"
35010,"He has knowledge of a cult of Talos. He will tell us what we need to know, or he will die. The choice is his. "
35012,Enjoy this while you can. Soon you will all be slaves.
35014,What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us years to achieve.
35015,"Well, I... If you're sure..."
35016,You mean... you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall?
35021,What are you doing that for?
35022,"Something in Winterhold, it looks like."
35028,So much wasted breath in that crew.
35031,Perhaps there's something you wish to confess?
35034,"The thieves are up in Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town. I'd take you there, but with Lucan gone, I'm busy with the store."
35035,"We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble."
35039,"Yes, I know. As does Astrid. And you've earned your payment, though the bonus is forfeit, as I'm sure you're aware."
35041,"You won't take my eye, man-thing!"
35044,Certainly you don't believe such things?
35048,I am a Thalmor Justiciar on important business that you are interfering with.
35054,"What? No! Guard, help!"
35055,"If it looks to you like an impoverished slum, that's because it is. Ulfric prefers that we live in squalor."
35056,"OK, your turn. Try and hit that target way in the back, far behind the other three. Remember to take your time and make your shot count."
35058,"There is another thing you could do for me. Suitable for someone of your particular talents, perhaps."
35060,"Things proceeding well, Listener?"
35061,"This is High Hrothgar, our temple, sanctuary, and home. We ask that you respect our solitude while you are here."
35064,"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out."
35065,I can't say I've been to Winterhold more than a handful of times. Can't see much reason most honest folk would want to come up here.
35068,"For all I know, the Gourmet is a woman!"
35070,"Ah, don't let my words cut you too deep. I've just been working the forge too hard. Trying to set this sword right."
35073,My lady... Surely you're not that naive. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon.
35074,"Yeah, thanks."
35077,"I've cooked every dish in your book, and I must say your brilliance is inspiring. My technique surely doesn't even approach yours... but whose would?"
35078,"It's not just the work, it's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously."
35079,"You ask a lot of questions for a mercenary.  Just get in there and open the gate, we'll try and provide help once that's done."
35080,"Oh, my! You? It is an honor! Your food has opened my eyes to the wonders this world can hold. "
35082,I've risked life and limb so that you may create another masterpiece. Make sure to think of me when you use them!
35083,I've fought colds tougher than you!
35084,"Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher."
35085,"We had the advantage of surprise this time, but things won't be so easy from here on out."
35086,Let me look.  This is a very exciting moment for me.
35089,"That's Vokun, the guardian of the scroll.  It must be just past him."
35091,It is not eyes that reveal another's true nature. It is the heart.
35093,That gem looks suspicious to me.
35095,"These wall carvings are ancient, we must be getting close."
35097,"Come and see what is for sale, traveler."
35100,You belong to Hircine now!
35101,You can be a part of a tremendous power - all you have to do is let your soul be absorbed by this axe. I never said it would be your power...
35102,No more.... No more!
35109,I'm glad you're on our side.
35112,"As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve."
35117,"When I meet Sarthis there, he's usually waiting for me outside with his bodyguard."
35121,Jarl is who you want to talk to. Always coin to be made killing off some Forsworn in the hills.
35122,Get the crown. We will keep an eye out for more of those dustmen.
35124,He used to live here in Riften at the Orphanage on the other side of town but I think he ran away. Can't say I blame him.
35126,She's telling everyone she's sick. But she's really locked herself in her room because she fears an assassin is out to get her.
35129,You should arrange the ceremony at the Temple of Mara right away. I can't wait.
35130,"Well, she needs to eat. I don't think she even knows where the kitchen is. And milady isn't exactly going to remove her own chamber pot, now is she?"
35131,"Our Family, my dearest. Our Family. Together, united as one, the Dark Brotherhood can accomplish anything."
35132,Let's go talk with her. Stay close. Talk of assassins has the guards jumpy. They might attack you if you're not standing near me.
35133,"I bet she would feel safer. And hopefully you wouldn't have to baby sit her for long. Once she calms down, she might start thinking straight again."
35135,And keeps herself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
35136,Then you are weak and inconsequential.
35137,"By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!"
35138,I thought you didn't believe I was in danger!
35139,"It doesn't really matter what I believe, now does it? I've brought you someone who can protect you. That's what you want, isn't it?"
35145,Leave - me - a - lone!
35146,"Yield. I yield, Stormcloak! The city of Markarth is yours."
35147,"Well, what are you waiting for?!"
35149,"Come in, come in! Shut the door behind you!"
35151,Think we should buy more horses next season?
35152,"We've got the same pride, the same honor, and we've got wealth. No wonder they envy us."
35153,"Don't waste time apologizing, just find the book!"
35155,"Why have taxes not come in from Granite Hill, Nenya? We should send some guards down there."
35158,"So how's this work exactly? Do you just kind of stand there on the look out? That's what Bolgeir does. Well, he sort of looms more than stands."
35160,Haldyn's been known to obscure his hideaways with magic. 
35161,I'm going to examine the body before the rats can get to it.
35162,I'd had Eorlund forge this for Thorald. It was to be a present for his return. I suppose he can't have it now.
35163,"Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I said sorry, yes?"
35164,"You have reconsidered my offer, hmm? Onikaan kron?"
35166,No problem. Thanks for springing me. I owe you. Look me up in Riften if you make it out.
35167,"No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea."
35168,I cannot best you!
35169,No! I'm saving myself for someone special. Someone who loves me dearly.
35170,"Tragic, of course. "
35172,I had no idea you were a woman of violence. What exactly are you intending to do here? 
35173,"Now that you mention it, there is."
35174,I... I can only imagine Aela's anger. I'll make sure not to cross her for a while.
35175,Unfortunate. He was an excellent sparring partner. I'll miss our training sessions.
35176,He has joined the honored dead. This will be a difficult time for us all.
35177,"There are places in the world that aren't wrapped in ice, you know."
35184,Go. Grieve in whatever way you know.
35186,"Thank you for telling me. This is a day where our souls must cry, and our hearts will answer. "
35188,"There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?"
35189,Wretched Dark Elves. It's just my luck I ended up working under one of them.
35192,That's it! You've got one of them lined up!
35193,"Pretty, pretty flesh. Let me out!"
35194,"We've been keeping this collection since the Second Era. Books have come and gone during that time, but it's mostly intact."
35197,"Well, explain yourself!"
35199,"Did you know what we were attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our efforts have been for nothing?"
35200,"Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!"
35203,"...rise from death, Blood of our Blood."
35205,"All right, just because it's you, we'll try again."
35206,I... you're right of course. It can be hard to hear the winds of Kynareth when all you hear are the rabble in the temple.
35208,Why are you here? Get away from me!
35211,"...rise from death, Blood of our Blood."
35212,...hear he's decided to let the Hags turn him into a Briarheart. 
35215,"Oh, this is going to be fun. You've got to use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy while - get this - they use their Wabbajack to defeat you! "
35216,"Why is this suddenly so important, anyway?"
35217,The staff! Use it on the Eye!
35221,Mercer never told you about her?
35223,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
35226,"Yes, but that's too close to Mixwater Mill. We don't want to get Gilfre angry at us by stealing her trees."
35229,We want compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
35230,I'm of a mind with Irileth.
35232,"You, of all people. Get out!"
35233,"Suit yourself. I hate to turn away any friend of Hadvar, but in times like these... you understand if I can't just take your word for it."
35236,"Oh, yes... spices. That was a special order for someone in Whiterun. Should be along any day now. Don't let it worry you, my dear."
35238,Viinturuth! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
35239,Nahagliiv! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
35243,Vuljotnaak! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
35245,"Alok, Nahagliiv. Tiid boaan."
35249,"And if it isn't true... well, then the fight to free Skyrim goes on. Either way, I don't see the use in talking to the Empire."
35250,"Is that so? We shall see, villain. We shall see!"
35251,Did we have an appointment? No... it was a delivery? I can't remember.
35255,It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty of Alduin's Dragon Cult.
35256,Lok...
35260,Don't forget to check your tribute chest once in a while. As Guild Master you're getting a significant cut of the spoils.
35264,I don't know for sure. I spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion publicly; I suspect that's why these men were hired to hunt me down.
35265,"If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn."
35268,"I love the man, bless his heart, but he doesn't know the whole story."
35269,"Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it."
35271,Malborn? Ah... very good. I think we understand each other.
35272,Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?
35275,"What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again."
35276,I'm afraid that kind of thing doesn't work on Captains in the Imperial Army.
35282,"By Ysmir, a thief!"
35284,"Ha! Oh, that's a good one, friend. Killing Lurbuk... I mean, can you even imagine something so ludicrous? Depriving the world of my unique talents?"
35285,"It can't be lost. It just can't! It's irreplaceable, do you understand?"
35287,No. Not now. Not until you return to the path of wisdom.
35289,Spells and incantations for those with the talent to cast them.
35291,"And skillfully, too. I've been watching you for ages, it seems. You have the makings of a fine hunter."
35292,Best to keep clear.
35293,"Ah, yet another new face. I'm from Hammerfell, you see. I can hardly keep track of all the people I've been meeting."
35296,What about the other one?
35297,"This is why so few follow it, and why the world is as it is."
35298,"Hold, mage, and listen well..."
35299,"I'm sorry, I'm still a bit dizzy from everything."
35300,Those who are ignorant find the Way of the Voice easy to ridicule.
35301,Dragonborn... wait.
35305,We do not regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the Voice.
35306,"It is called ""Dragonrend"", but its Words of Power are unknown to us."
35313,But not Dragonrend. The knowledge of that Shout was lost in the time before history began.
35314,Do not be afraid. Faasnu. Let me feel the power of your Thu'um.
35316,"It's hardly a secret that they have ties to the Empire, and hate anyone who speaks out against it."
35319,He also has a fearsome control of Destruction magic. 
35320,You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business.
35321,"But without Ulfric to inflame their passions, they'll settle down and return to their homes eventually."
35322,I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.
35323,"I don't think we have anything to discuss, Stormcloak."
35324,"Good, we've wasted enough time here."
35326,"Good. Can't have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can we?"
35330,There's a war on and you don't know what I'm talking about? The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for.
35331,"Left Hand Mine deals with iron, the perfect metal to dig with a war going on."
35333,Stand aside.  I don't need to speak to you.
35335,"No problem, I can carry a good bit of gear."
35337,"If you're the best the Guild's got, they're in worse shape than I imagined."
35338,"The North Wind is my mistress, and I'm her master. I don't tolerate any disloyalty."
35339,I can't believe I got caught.
35340,Do take care handling that case of wine... it's irreplaceable.
35343,You're not getting anything until you pay the Guild back.
35344,"The Jarl is, as you can imagine, very busy. Perhaps I can assist you?"
35345,"I tolerate your son because he'll do anything I ask, without question. I'd expect the same from my own son."
35352,"I'm telling you, this one is different..."
35353,"Yes, we spoke at length while you were in Whiterun dealing with our meadery situation."
35355,I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood.
35356,"Have it your way, then."
35357,"So we're not turning back, you fool."
35362,"Would you like me to send someone? Faralda or Phinis, perhaps?"
35363,Laas...
35364,I do hope it's true. So many opportunities...
35367,And you can trust me. Zu'u ni tahrodiis. Alduin has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now.
35368,What's all the commotion?
35370,"Now, it's time to get your feet wet and I don't want to waste a lot of time talking about anything but business."
35371,A pity. You have any idea how much fangs would be worth? Or even better -- bottle their flame. The right buyer would pay an immense amount.
35374,"Bottle... their flame? I can't... No, I don't think I've any interest in that sort of thing."
35375,"Say, if you're traveling, could you keep an eye out for them? Valdr and his men. I think they were after bear up north."
35378,"However, as the head of the company it's my job to make sure we maintain good relationships with prospective partners and investors."
35379,(Laughing.)
35382,Yes. The man came by at noon just like you said. I gave him the package and he gave me this pouch for you.
35384,I just need a little to get going.
35386,"You should've stayed in your precious forests, elf!"
35388,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
35389,"Is that so? Well, perhaps a night in jail might loosen your tongue. Hmmm?"
35390,"Look, I want you to have this. I know it isn't much, but it's important to me."
35391,"I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd never sleep with anyone besides my good wife, Drifa."
35394,I trust the night finds you well?
35396,Planning some exciting heists I hope?
35397,"Things are looking up around here, lad."
35398,"Good to see you, lad! How are things?"
35400,"Yes, lad? Did you need something?"
35401,Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough damage already?
35403,Attack while it's landed!
35404,"Oh, goodness no. There are those far more skilled than I."
35405,My men are ready. Now it's up to you.
35408,"Ah, I see. I've just remembered that I saved a few septims in case of an emergency. This is starting to feel like one."
35409,What's going on? What happened in there?
35412,"Second, we have the ""White-Gold Tower"" which is heavy cream with a layer of blended mead, lavender and dragon's tongue on top."
35413,"And here you are. Good. Come in, browse the display, and let's talk. I have a job you look perfect for."
35416,Is that so?
35417,Are you kidding me? Look at this place.
35419,"Anyway, here is your reward.  Thanks again."
35422,"Excellent. Looks like you've really driven them into hiding. Keep this up. We'll wipe them out, yet."
35425,Maybe the order has something to do with the Symbols up there.
35426,Stop! We know you're holding a Daedric artifact. Hand it over.
35428,"The Vigil of Stendarr cleanses all Daedric filth from Tamriel. Give us any artifacts you have, or we'll purge you like all the others."
35430,"A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes."
35432,"Keerava, we're running low on Black-Briar Mead."
35441,I feel like I can take on all of Skyrim.
35442,I fight and I'll win. Simple as that.
35443,I can smell your fear.
35444,"Soon, the elves will again seek to rule the world. We must ready ourselves to fight them."
35446,Just point me to the fight.
35448,"Come on, I can take anyone. And that ain't just the mead talkin'."
35449,A jester. In these parts. Man must be completely off his tree.
35451,Ha ha! Look out. Here I come!
35453,Look! Look!
35457,So you really are...
35458,"Oh, they'll find some way to send us there. It'll be just my luck."
35459,"Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order."
35461,I'll... get you...
35462,Imperial promises are simply a way to lull you while they prepare a dagger for your back.
35466,"If my Asgeir is happy, then I'm happy. Really."
35467,"Dorthe, dear, I've been growin' some really lovely vegetables. Maybe tomorrow you could help me plant a new patch? What do you say?"
35468,At some point we should hire Tekla on here. If she could just spend less time serving Dengeir...
35470,Suddenly I feel like I can take on the world.
35471,"Dez motmahus. Even to the dov, who ride the currents of Time, destiny is elusive."
35475,No one can defeat me.
35476,I ain't scared of nothin'.
35477,"Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets ""punished."""
35479,"Every knight needs a squire. I could help you with your sword, things like that."
35480,There's a smart lass. Check the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
35481,"Hmm, Esbern's right. Look like pressure plates."
35482,"You need something to do, or you just enjoy slowing down the hard-working folk?"
35484,It's a shame the Black-Briar Meadery took this place over. I never liked it as much as our Honningbrew.
35486,"Lead on, to Ysgramor and glory."
35487,"If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the owner, Sabjorn."
35488,I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; several of our citizens have expressed their admiration.
35489,"All right. I won't deny it, child. What you heard is true. But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin."
35490,"Then, maybe a few years ago, it all stopped. He didn't even bother to contact us anymore."
35491,His real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.
35495,None of my business.
35496,"Yes, quite a shame. It was a fine weapon."
35497,"Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a mistake."
35499,"Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please."
35502,"Get out there, shake him down and see what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have any questions."
35504,"And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back."
35506,Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude.
35510,They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for years. I'm impressed it reached this point.
35511,If I had one. Sold my last one to you a bit ago.
35512,Who can say? Perhaps she collects them for display like works of art in a nonsensical art gallery.
35513,Thorald? Thorald!
35515,"What do you need, bard?"
35517,Gah! Look over there. I can't believe it.
35518,"Well, then. You made it, safe and sound. Good. Come on, I have a place we can talk."
35520,"It's okay, mother. I understand."
35521,"You jest, but they've been able to avoid identification for years. They're obviously well-funded, driven and patient."
35524,"Because Calcelmo doesn't want anyone to go in. He runs the museum, he makes the rules."
35525,"It was so lucrative, I was considering moving the Guild to Solitude to save us time."
35526,"When Gulum-Ei was getting us merchandise from the East Empire Company, we were making a hefty profit."
35533,"City got attacked once by those damn bandits, come east across the lake, from Faldar's Tooth. They won't be trying that again."
35534,"It was Dengeir who made me a steward, long ago when he was young."
35535,"She would? If she's willing to deal with him, then everything would be all right."
35537,"To the Inn for a drink, of course! Where else could I even go in this gods-forsaken town?"
35540,"As you wish, my Thane."
35543,Well in that case. You'll have to hand over your life as well as your coin.
35545,I'd ask you maintain civility while you're here.
35546,"All right, can you describe it to me?"
35547,"Oh, thank goodness! I've been wandering alone for so long, I thought I'd never see another soul again."
35552,"If you can stop them, you'll be a true hero!"
35553,"They're at Mistwatch. Here, let me show you on your map...."
35555,"Pardon. I saw you toss a piece of armor. You wouldn't mind if I take it, then?"
35565,You were there for Roggvir's execution...
35566,There should be a few basic tomes around here somewhere in case your training is even more sub-standard than I've heard.
35567,"Stay out of trouble, Khajiit."
35568,Not now.
35571,"Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you."
35572,"Now, cast the ward spell, and keep it up."
35574,"Don't you ever wonder, father?"
35578,This gathering is nothing more than a boast. The Thalmor are reminding us that we're at their beck and call.
35579,Hope this war lasts long enough that I get to fight in it. Battle! Glory!
35581,You're going to end up helping me. I know it.
35582,"I hope the elf didn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that."
35583,Have I done something to make you bother me?
35584,Uf!
35587,"Like some horrible monster was turned inside out, and then exploded. What did you do?"
35588,Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
35590,"This, this is why people have a problem with your college, Nelacar."
35591,"Heh, a Nord skull makes the best axe blade. 'bout all they're good for."
35592,And Torygg wasn't ready to let it fall apart.
35594,Don't give them a chance to warn the others!
35596,I get so lonely out here.
35597,"Viola, dark elves sleep just like the rest of us."
35598,What brings you all the way out here?
35599,"We are in this together, yes?"
35600,That's tremendous! I have to admit I didn't fully believe it still existed. Now let's take a look at this...
35602,You want to talk to me? After everything you've done?
35603,"No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn!"
35606,"Ah, the nectar of the gods! If there's ever anything I can do for you, just name it!"
35610,Hah! I wish that I had your optimism.
35611,Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and would leave Whiterun dangerously exposed...
35613,Clear Namira's sanctuary of the undead.
35614,"Oh. Oh, I see...."
35617,"If it's not too much to ask, put the weapon away? Thanks."
35624,"Then came the flash of light - just on the horizon, within the clouds that mark the border between worlds."
35625,And it's just as I suspected. The energies need to be channeled back through the nexus a second and third time...
35626,"Draugr creeping down the mountain to climb through my window at night, that kind of thing. I admit, I still don't much like the look of it."
35627,"My parents live there. I usually make the journey to bring them gifts and to just say hello, but I haven't been well lately."
35629,"But was it worth tearing Skyrim apart, and maybe destroying the Empire? No, Ulfric will have a lot to answer for in the end."
35630,"And not just any dragon, but the Dragon - Alduin, the World-Eater, the dragon who devours both the living and the dead."
35631,I think I like this new mate of my father's. I mean... nothing like that. I just think she's nice.
35632,I never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.
35633,Mind's playing tricks on me...
35637,"Do it, Listener. Kill me."
35638,Damn it! There's no way through.
35639,"Hey, Lod, how is the worst farmer in the hold doing?"
35640,You want my advice? Pay your debt to Vex quickly and she'll forget the whole thing.
35641,Come back when you're in the Guild's good graces.
35642,It's a shame you got booted from the Guild... things were going so well.
35643,"Begone, before even my philosophy is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace, and you are not."
35644,"What are you, blind? That store is empty. Forsworn get almost every shipment that comes in."
35645,Hmph. I don't talk with Guild traitors.
35646,"Settle your accounts with Vex, and then we can talk."
35647,Let me worry about the Imperials.
35649,I'll serve you after you've paid Vex.
35650,"Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me."
35654,"My Alembic. I need it for some research, and can't seem to find it."
35655,There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.
35657,Don't want to know what you did and I don't care. Just keep away from me.
35658,"I don't really have a mind for war, and I think he likes having an untrained opinion from time to time."
35661,Now we have to kick you out until things cool down. Can't give you any jobs or payouts for goods.
35662,I have responsibilities to attend to. We'll continue this discussion some other time.
35663,"That means your out. No jobs, no payouts... no nothing."
35667,Speak to Vex to make the proper reparations if you want back in. Now get out of my sight.
35670,"Yes, master. I'm sorry, I'll get back to those notes straight away."
35673,"The Old Hroldan Inn is still open, bless poor Eydis's memory."
35674,"My job is to serve the Jarl, not waste time talking with travelers."
35677,"A pleasure to see you as well, Niranye. What can I do for you?"
35680,You've broken the rules and now you need to pay... and it's going to cost you quite a bit.
35682,"Well, well. If it isn't Brynjolf's little protege."
35683,Poor Nilsine has been wrecked since her sister was killed.
35684,"Remember, I've got the freshest meat in all of Whiterun."
35686,"You've been in Riften for quite some time now, Lady Mjoll. I fear that you soon may leave us."
35687,Did you think we'd accept a heartfelt apology and let bygones be bygones?
35688,"This is the Thieves Guild, genius. How do you think? With gold. A lot of gold."
35690,You made it? I was sure I'd find you face down in the dirt.
35693,"Pick pockets, knock over houses... heck, I don't care if you have to bust into a palace. You do what you have to do to come up with the coin."
35694,"Well, I'm also certain you're aware that our own city guard failed to provide the protection required to ensure safe passage of the shipment."
35699,I have no desire to seek religion.
35703,"It's that Braith girl again, isn't it? Has she been bothering you again? I've a mind to speak with her mother."
35710,"First, Master Wulfgar will teach you the final word of Unrelenting Force. You are ready."
35711,I suppose it's tough for an old dog to learn new tricks.
35713,There is no trust for Khajiit in this place.
35714,And here I expected you to hop the next caravan to Morrowind. What have you got for me?
35715,What did you do! I'm...I'm see through! This better not be permanent. You can't just go around making women invisible like this!
35717,Imperial.
35718,"I play the lute. If you'd like to hear something, it only costs five gold."
35719,Go cast your fancy magic someplace else.
35720,"Whoa, now... ease off on the magic..."
35721,You better not be here to stir up any trouble.
35722,"It's all here. Well, congratulations. You're one of us again."
35724,So you are alive. I was starting to wonder.
35725,"I was born and raised in Skyrim, but the Nords treat us like dirt."
35726,Go ahead and play your joke.
35728,"You're making a fatal mistake. Apologize, and you may yet live..."
35732,I just don't know if I can keep you safe.
35733,"Well, well... color me impressed, lass. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!"
35734,What else is there?
35736,I want soldiers sent to deal with these dragons. Every able-bodied man and woman who can carry a bow.
35739,"Ha! No matter! Honestly, I don't want to know. Why ruin the surprise?"
35742,"You're an animal, Tythis... keep away from me."
35743,For a hundred lifetimes my heart has burned for revenge on Alduin too long delayed.
35745,Killing dragons isn't defending the Reach?
35747,Surprised to see you working. Mulush almost broke your arm yesterday.
35748,Does it look like I can afford losing a day's wage? That damn Orc isn't getting the best of me.
35752,"It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me."
35754,"When are you going to stop by the temple, Madesi?"
35758,Hadvar? How do you know him?
35760,I'll tell you what I told him -- stay out of it. It's none of your business. Those aren't folks you want to get tangled up with.
35761,"Dagur's been talking at you, hasn't he? Gotten you roped into his little plan to fix Ranmir's life?"
35762,"Oh, no."
35764,You'll wind up getting yourself killed. Dagur shouldn't have said a word about it.
35766,"Ranmir's a good boy, and he doesn't deserve what fate pushed his way, but there's only so far I'll go to risk my neck."
35767,"I am close, so close! You must force him to see reason!"
35770,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
35773,"I shouldn't have believed the story and just refused the trade. But I didn't, and now I'm stuck with this worthless junk."
35776,"I see you wish to be reasonable, perhaps I misjudged you."
35777,"When I told him there was no more Honningbrew, that he'd drank it all, he got angry."
35778,What is it? I haven't had much sleep.
35780,What are your thoughts on all this?
35781,"The moot will meet and choose Ulfric as High King. With his troops in most of the cities, they have little choice."
35783,"Women murdered time and again, and all the guards care about is the war."
35784,"Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you. To Markarth and Calcelmo."
35789,Because killing her would yield no political advantage.
35790,You'd do well to remember that.
35791,I'm only hoping whatever means he used to learn the language will still be available to you.
35792,"The Hall of Valor, where heroes wait to follow Shor to the final battle."
35795,"As long as Ulfric wishes Elisif to remain Jarl, remain Jarl she will. And the Thanes will continue to follow her orders."
35796,Not if I get it first.
35801,"When Ulfric unleashed such fury, my husband he... he simply ceased to be."
35802,"What? What is it now, mother?"
35803,And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare.
35806,Because that's what traitorous cowards do when they desire power.
35807,"Well done, indeed. This will be of great service. Understanding the enemy's position makes us all the more equipped to usurp it."
35810,Ask her about it if you want an earful.
35813,So it begins.
35814,Hmmm... A question I am all to familiar with. One my very Thanes ask often.
35815,"Farewell, Brother Casimir."
35819,But... I can't run the Temple without the support of people who are inspired by the Gildergreen. How can this little tree bring new worshippers?
35820,"Around here, you'll want to learn to live your own life. Remember, nobody rules anybody in the Companions."
35822,See me at my forge if you need arms or armor.
35826,"Ah, the air is good today. I welcome the smell of blood from all the kills I will make."
35829,"Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in the Dead Man's Respite."
35831,We all have faith in you.
35832,The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for?
35834,My sister and I inherited a modest sum of money. We decided to travel and seek out whatever adventures we could find.
35838,Do you wish to become a Blade?
35839,It's not that bad.
35840,We are children of the Twilight. Beings who are to be guided from the darkness into the light. And from the light into darkness.
35841,"I knew it! Let me see, please!"
35844,I really thought you'd be able to save me.
35848,You should think about staying the night. Corpulus keeps a clean inn.
35849,Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath. 
35851,"Oh, come now. You didn't really expect to manipulate people forever, did you? Your luck had to run out sometime."
35852, 
35853,My lord. Please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we need more information before we act.
35854,Fighting draugr is as much about controlling your fear as anything else.
35856,"All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like things have gotten out of hand."
35858,For Kynareth!
35859,It'll be shuttered by the end of the month.
35861,"I think the Jarl should hear about this. Maybe double his taxes. No, triple them. That should teach those people a lesson."
35862,Is there some way I can assist you?
35863,"If, however, you seek something more, I will be happy to assist you."
35864,"It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses."
35865,"Now, I must advise you that if your only purpose in being here is to complain, you would be far better off speaking with the Jarl of Winterhold."
35867,I suppose so. Seems like it was just turning summer yesterday.
35868,"Oh, forgive me."
35871,The good people of Skyrim on occasion would rather pass judgment than attempt to understand what we do here.
35873,The more important question is: why are you here?
35874,"And if, in the process, my presence helps to deter those who might seek to do harm, so be it."
35875,Let me put the pieces on the altar. We'll see if Mehrunes Dagon can still be reached.
35876,"I trust you don't presume on our friendship? I am a Jarl, after all. I wouldn't want to appear foolish in front of these people."
35877,"Now at last, the Thalmor will get their way. The worship of Talos will finally be stamped out. Or so they think."
35883,Now there's a mystery.
35884,Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.
35886,"First off, there's a damn Orc hanging around getting in the way. He's been yammering on about needing help with some kind of vision quest."
35891,I suppose that's true. Fine.
35896,"Good journey, my child!"
35897,"If you really are Dragonborn, like out of the old tales, you ought to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?"
35898,"Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed. Here, take it."
35900,"Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it."
35903,Shhhhhh...
35905,"The goddess smiles at your efforts, child. The dawn shines bright upon you."
35906,"Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier."
35907,Guards brought me in about 12 years ago. Was running a good group of bandits up until then.
35908,"Is that what you call it? In the Legion we would have called it ""useless."" Look how brittle the metal is!"
35909,It's time. The Skull must be destroyed.
35910,I guess it's all over. I expected... I don't know what I expected.
35911,"Excuse me, I'm trying to watch a traitor to the Empire lose his head."
35912,"Well, I suppose if that means what I think it does..."
35913,"Careful with those flames, unless you plan on torching something."
35914,That's my brother up there.
35915,Roggvir... Why did it have to be like this?
35917,Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged in. You can taste the fear.
35919,You have returned. Will you now aid me in contacting Malacath?
35920,Some can't separate the animal from themselves. Go feral. This poor sod could have been anyone.
35921,"Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened."
35923,Better that than dealing with Ulfric's wizard like some do.
35925,"There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so."
35926,"You're strong. Clever. I'd be proud to face the challenges of life with you, if you feel the same way."
35929,I don't know much. Only the old tales about the ancient heroes who would use the Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
35934,Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.
35937,Ha! That ain't nothing. Wait till you see what I got planned for next week.
35939,"Lady Mara's messenger returns. What can I help you with, my child?"
35940,Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves. I fear dark days approach and all of Skyrim's strength will be needed.
35943,I'll look the other way this time.
35944,*coughs* The cat... *gasp* Ra'jiir... ambushed me. He's trying to take the sword back! I... can't... *gasp*
35945,Speak with Legate Rikke. She will determine if you are Legion material.
35947,"No, not at all. It's just..."
35949,Peace! Everyone stand down. That's an order. Stand down!
35950,You're right. Ulfric isn't in any position to ask for Markarth.
35951,"Just guide them well, and all will work out."
35954,Joor...
35955,You're right. Why dilute the glory with too many souls fighting over it? We'll drive out the Empire and be celebrated as heroes when we win.
35956,"You help my people and purchase a house from my steward, and I'll make you my Thane. "
35957,"Then listen to this - don't kill me. Let poor Cicero live! I attacked the strumpet Astrid, I did! And I'd do it again! Anything for our mother!"
35960,Try it again. Breath and focus.
35961,I think you'll find this payment to be more than fair.
35962,"Go on, now."
35964,"Oh wait, let me guess - you don't have them."
35967,"Can I help you with anything, Nirya?"
35968,I'm fortunate that Kust and the people of Falkreath have come to accept me as one of their own.
35969,Better men have tried. Let's finish this.
35970,How's business?
35971,Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.
35972,Very funny.
35975,"No, I... I was just asking."
35976,Come back later and I may have some work for you.
35977,It's as bad as ever.
35979,Very well. I respect your discretion.
35980,Wise is the one who spends a few coins now to make a fortune later.
35981,That's some good armor you've put together.
35983,That Stormcloak armor's getting on my nerves...
35984,"Yes, well. Perhaps you're right."
35986,"I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with ""the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?"""
35989,"Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping us from seeing our honored dead?"
35990,"Is it still worth it? When do you decide enough is enough, and just walk away?"
35991,"You. You aren't with the Forsworn, are you? People say they saw you when the prisoners escaped. So many dead."
35992,"Be careful where you step in the mine. Don't want to cover up some valuable ore, or gems, or... Or something..."
35994,Nah. Just... don't. Leave me outta it.
35995,Wanted to say something to you.
35996,I better get back to sorting the dry goods.
35998,"After the place is yours, come back to me and we'll deal with the rest of the nonsense."
35999,I know they laughed when I said I wanted to keep the mine open. I'll show them. I'll show them all.
36000,I think you and I are worth about a dozen soldiers each. We'll send that beast back where it came from.
36002,"The mine will be the talk of Skyrim soon, you'll see. It'll be the stuff of legends."
36005,<Giggling>
36011,"Oh dear, I didn't mean to say it like that. That wasn't a joke, really."
36012,"I'm stuck fighting a giant now, thanks to you. So you're going to help me."
36013,That's some good armor you've put together.
36016,You're it!
36017,"The door is hidden, but I will show you the way."
36019,"I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works. "
36022,Are you prepared?
36023,"Aela will be joining us shortly. Once she's inside, we can follow."
36025,"Follow me, and keep your eyes open. Daedra are powerful creatures and tricksters. Never know what you'll find."
36028,Why?
36029,"And now there's talk of rebellion, and dragons? What help could Idgrod be against them?"
36031,"This is no test, new blood. This is a gift. Come inside."
36033,"There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?"
36034,Agreed.
36035,"I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form."
36036,"Are you prepared to join your spirit with the beast world, friend?"
36038,"They're only a threat in the hills and along the roads, where they live. Everywhere else, we are in control."
36039,Unblooded.
36040,"Why don't they listen to me, Keerava? Why won't they do as I say?"
36041,"Come on... there! I got it, let's go!"
36046,"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
36047,Hmm....
36053,I almost envy you. That first time is always the most... intense.
36054,"Ah, but business! Of course. What kind of business?"
36061,"And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!"
36064,Cure? Hah. You're sounding like the old man.
36065,That's because there's nothing to tell. He left us to fend for ourselves and that's all you need to know.
36066,Argh!
36067,Oh! You got me!
36068,"Oh. Why... why certainly. I keep telling myself I'm not losing a son, I'm gaining an Imperial. Daughter. An Imperial daughter..."
36070,"If you've got the coin, you've come to the right place. Pull up a seat."
36073,Go away.
36074,Can't do that and keep an eye on things here at the same time.
36079,But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.
36081,The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic.
36084,You're looking at the best miner in Skyrim.
36086,Tell you what. You keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?
36088,"Halt, outlander!"
36089,"Maybe we could spend a little bit more and buy some meat, Endon."
36092, 
36093,I need you to help me show him the error of his ways by sneaking on board the Sload and planting some contraband.
36094,Of course I'm sure! He was asking about Esbern.
36096,"Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion, and I cannot ignore this situation."
36097,"Oh yes, that. Here you go. I hope this can be ready soon."
36098,"What...? No... No, this can't be happening..."
36100,You keep it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me. Congratulations. You've changed the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
36102,I don't understand. Why can't we go home?
36103,Some days I marvel that you haven't managed to blow yourself up.
36106,Why would you even listen to him?
36110,Blessings be with you.
36111,"I want her notes. You think you could get them for me, without her knowing?"
36113,"Finely done. Here, please accept this gift as a sign of my thanks."
36114,So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?
36115,"Magic? That's dangerous. You want to learn that, go to that College in Winterhold. They teach that stuff there."
36116,"Well, yes, but... there's no guarantee, of course."
36118,"You're making progress, Heimvar. But my boy could still work the bellows better than you do!"
36119,They say a priest of Mara is visiting the Windpeak Inn. Says the Divines will take care of everything. We'll see about that.
36121,"So, word has it you and Brynjolf know where Mercer's hiding. Good."
36124,Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.
36125,"Either way, the Reach is wild country these days. The Forsworn are everywhere. Best be careful."
36126,"Once Mede has been killed, escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've ""arranged"" for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded."
36131,Get over to the capital.
36132,"Marise, I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild has been harassing shopkeepers again."
36134,From Riverwood? The road south through Falkreath is the most direct route.
36136,"I doubt the blessing's effects last for very long, so ask whenever you're heading out, and I'll perform the proper rites."
36137,"I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways."
36139,Aha!
36141,It's coming loose. I can feel it.
36142,"And then, at a time we are still not sure when, they disappeared. The whole people, all at once. Leaving behind only their works."
36149,"After you talk to Brynjolf and Mercer, come back and see me."
36150,It is a gift. Anyone who believes otherwise does not and cannot understand it.
36151,"The Divines reveal things to me at times, yes. I do not hide this."
36152,"These sands are cold, but Khajiit feels warmness from your presence."
36154,"They say that our cause is false and that we are nothing more than thieves, thugs and murderers!"
36159,You will not disrespect Jarl Idgrod while in this Hall. Do we have an understanding?
36160,Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion.
36161,Damn faithless Imperials.
36162,"Yeah, got this note."
36163,"Then by all means, go about your business."
36165,"I won't repeat them, and I won't allow them to be spread under this roof."
36168,You really don't know?
36170,"Mind your manners in this hall, friend."
36172,"Bah, it's no use. Let's get back to it, then."
36173,"Why, good evening Jonna!"
36175,I'm glad we see eye to eye on this.
36177,I wish you well friend. Be careful.
36178,"See, he's living with Alva now. That started the day after the fire."
36182,Most of the establishments in Skyrim keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers.
36183,I don't know. Someone in town said it.
36184,"If you need a drink, just say the word."
36185,Okay.
36186,"Don't believe everything you hear, child."
36190,Filthy pickpocket!
36191,"Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!"
36192,Get out of here. Get out of here and never come back!
36193,"Hmm. Yes, here it is."
36194,Ah. Well. Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
36195,Good. He must be kept safe from harm.
36196,"Sure, leave. Not like you care anyway."
36197,Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared. 
36199,"I will be Jarl someday, mother?"
36201,"That is what the Divines have planned for you, yes."
36202,"Farewell, then."
36203,"No, Gorm. I am simply telling you what I see."
36204,"Yes, okay. Well thank you."
36205,Let's keep moving.
36206,That's a fine potion you've put together.
36207,"I'm telling you, I heard it. Howling. Those werewolf tales are true."
36209,"Watch it, there, sister."
36210,That she did. Very good. I'll tell Brynjolf.
36212,I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here.
36215,"Well, I... Don't you see?"
36216,Hmm?
36217,"No offense, but you're not looking so good. Are you feeling ill?"
36218,You all right? You look like you might be sick.
36219,You look awful. Better not get me sick.
36227,You look worse than I feel.
36228,Get out of here.... I'm in no mood to talk...
36229,You're looking a little rough around the edges. You feeling all right?
36230,"And a sound, too. Distinct and indistinct. Not thunder... something else. Something I should recognize, but in the dream I cannot place it."
36231,This better be good...
36232,"Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment."
36233,"Remember, keep it clean. We don't want blood on our hands."
36234,"Mark my words, I'll be Jarl again someday!"
36235,"We really must discuss the security here in Dragonsreach. Perhaps we could limit patrols in the city, and retain more guards here?"
36237,You think some Emperor sitting on a gilded throne in Cyrodiil is going to know what's best for Skyrim? 
36239,"I never knew my mother, but I doubt even she acted as affectionate with my father as Yatul and Bolar do."
36240,Remember. I need that bandit dead. Not alive.
36241,You're trying my patience.
36242,"Vampires are clever hunters. More clever than you, definitely."
36243,"Are you quite sure? I don't want to get in the way, but..."
36246,There is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years.
36249,Retrieve that shield at all costs.
36251,"By Sithis, you slew everyone! Well, except for that one you kept alive, to serve as witness. Does your wickedness, or your skill, know no bounds?"
36256,"There was some ruckus over by that weird black door. You weren't involved in that craziness, were you?"
36259,That's so sweet of you.
36260,Think nothing of it.
36261,"Now, on to the business at hand I suppose, hmm?"
36262,"No, I'm a Redguard. My family hails from the Imperial Province. Ah, but I left home when I was just a lad. Been wandering ever since."
36266,There must be another way. The risk is too great.
36267,Yes. Definitely early Akaviri stonework here.
36268,We've got to get this bridge down.
36271,Let me out. They're going to kill me!
36276,"Yes, that's it. The symbol on the middle pillar."
36277,"Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the left."
36278,"Given that Sky Haven Temple was sealed against the return of the Dragonborn, I would try turning all the pillars to that symbol."
36281,It's the part with the severed head I find most impressive. My compliments.
36282,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
36283,Be careful.
36285,I'm looking for a place called Bard's Leap. They say the echo of a song sung from there can be heard all the way in Solitude.
36288,"I'll take my leave, then."
36290,"I know of your deeds, and am honored to address a member of the Companions."
36292,"Yes, sera?"
36294,"But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate the altar. Until you came."
36297,[coughing]
36298,"Yes. Your reward is waiting for you, mortal. Further down."
36300,Clearly you've never spent any time in Morrowind.
36303,"When your enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be watching."
36305,The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the Imperials hold to theirs.
36307,"Now, I have a soul in Oblivion that needs claiming. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!"
36312,We are on the hunt.
36313,You made your decision. Now live with it.
36314,Look. You're making my customers nervous. Put the weapon away.
36317,No. Kill him. Crush his bones. Tear at his flesh.
36324,Well. I'll let it slide this time. But you'd be smart to take that off. Someone might get the wrong idea.
36325,Just like always -- nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.
36326,You don't seem to realize there's a war on. What you are is a damn Imperial spy!
36330,You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my sister will be glad to help you out.
36331,I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.
36332,"If we run into any Imperials, just let me do the talking, all right?"
36335,"The College will be here for you, no matter what. We always look after our own."
36336,You're mine!
36337,Alright now. Everyone back away. Let the law handle this.
36338,So be it. We gave you a choice.
36341,"See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. When I was a boy, that place always used to give me nightmares."
36342,"But until we get that confirmed by General Tullius, just stay clear of other Imperial soldiers and avoid any complications, all right?"
36343,"Listen, as far as I'm concerned you've already earned your pardon."
36344,The Blackblood Marauders are... very identifiable. I didn't want anyone thinking the Blackbloods were getting too bold.
36346,"Okay, okay. I'll deal with it."
36347,There's just so much to memorize. How am I supposed to remember what goes where for every single herb?
36349,"One moment while I ""correct"" some of these documents... That should do it."
36350,"You make an interesting offer. Very well, I'm sure that I can put the extra coin to good use."
36351,I've got my eyes on you.
36354,"How kind. At my age, I've certainly learned how to spend wisely."
36355,It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with her?
36358,Not just any dragon scales. Heartscales. Very special.
36360,"I'll take your money, but I make no promises of a large return on your investment. These are troubled times, after all."
36361,Come back to me if you find anything.
36362,"Oh? Well, I won't turn down your money."
36364,Everything's in order.
36365,"Shh.. Uncle, please. Keep your voice down. I'm fine. But we should go inside to talk."
36367,"Think that's water in the river? Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth, friend."
36368,"It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring."
36370,May prosperity bless us both!
36371,"Thank you. When I have the time, I'll try to think of how best to use this."
36372,"In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh."
36374,"It's enough for me to know that he's out there somewhere, and not locked up like an animal in a cage."
36375,"Studies stars? I remember the last time the word ""stars"" was flown through the Hall of the Elements. Bad things had happened."
36377,"Thank you so much! With this coin, I'll be able to double my stock."
36378,I'll start planning how best to spend this. You have my thanks!
36379,"Ah, the sound of clinking coins. Even better, the sound of clinking coins in my hand!"
36386,Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use.
36388,You appear hesitant to don your Nightingale Armor. What's troubling you?
36389,"Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long."
36391,No! You'll never take me alive!
36392,"So says you. I think I've hit my limit on these things. Tell you what, one more and you win the contest."
36393,Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
36394,It's... in a hollowed-out rock. In the tundra. A bit west of Whiterun. Now please... please stop.
36396,What was that? Don't do it again.
36397,You there! That was uninvited. No more. 
36398,"We're not killing them, they were already dead. We're helping them back to Sovngarde."
36399,Ah Please! Don't hurt me!
36401,Why do you ask me that?
36402,Wow! That was fun. Do it again!
36404,"Don't mean to be rude, but I'm too busy to talk right now."
36406,I've never seen Pavo so happy. It's good to be back in Kolskeggr.
36409,"No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale. Well done."
36410,Oh! I don't feel any different. What did you do?
36413,Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.
36414,Oh! What did you just do?
36415,Ah! I'm just an old woman. Don't hurt me.
36416,"My husband Eorlund tends the Skyforge up at Jorrvaskr, the Companions mead hall. There's no finer smith in the nine holds."
36417,Ah! Keep your spells away from me.
36419,"Whoa, whoa, whoa? What did you do?"
36420,"And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards."
36421,"If I hadn't heard it with my own ears I wouldn't have believed it. How could Astrid have done this to us? Strangely, I feel only pity for her..."
36423,"Could I maybe, skip the excavation, Uncle Calcelmo? I, uh, I just think you won't need me."
36427,We want compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
36428,Magic is for the weak. Pick up some steel if you want to fight me.
36429,Now why would I want to talk to you?
36431,About time you showed up.
36432,"We're ready, Dragonborn. Just say the word."
36433,"Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to buy."
36434,Huh? Don't do that!
36435,"That mound you remembered sounds like what we're looking for. East of Kynesgrove, right?"
36436,"Don't try to magic me, you damn wizard."
36437,"Quite. Yet that recent business with the young officer. Maro, was it? How dreadful. The son of your commander, plotting your assassination."
36438,That was pathetic. It didn't even do anything.
36442,Keep your damn spells to yourself.
36443,What the... Don't do that!
36445,Wow! What was that? Do it again!
36446,I know you had some part in Sinding's escape. Don't deny it...
36448,"Yeah, I guess I have a minute. What do you want?"
36449,"When the colossus struck, Grimsever was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly."
36453,It matters little to me. Either way I'll be sending your heads back to Cyrodiil.
36455,I think the war is just an excuse. If it does end there will be a new reason and a new place.
36456,"I heard about the attack on Jorrvaskr, and the killing of your honored leader. You have my sympathies, Companion."
36457,Thanks!
36458,Don't go casting spells on a woman without asking her permission.
36460,He he. That'll teach the little loony.
36462,No! Not again! I shall not be denied again!
36464,Hey! You trying to pull a fast one on me?
36465,I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing.
36466,Huh? What...oh! That felt nice.
36467,Healing magic? An Orc lets her wounds heal naturally...
36469,Huh. I feel better now.
36470,"If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my duties."
36473,"Sorry, sir. These old bones do like a bit of warmth in the evening. There's no need to make fun."
36474,I'm the brewmaster around here. What did you want?
36475,"Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after one of the last greatest heists is just an insult."
36476,I hope you're not expecting a thank you.
36478,My thanks. I feel... better.
36481, 
36483,What? Do I have mead on my chin?
36484,Hey! What did you do to me? My body is gone!
36485,Hmm. I could be a great hunter like this.
36486,Ah! I am now like the Shadowscales of old.
36487,"There you go. Take a look around, there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I can find something for these burns."
36488,"Hmm? Oh, well... To be honest, I was just thinking of Nazeem. The gap between us seems to be widening. He is just so... self-absorbed."
36489,Hey! This could be handy!
36490,"I know your kind, always sneaking about."
36491,Hey! Where did I go? I can't see myself!
36492,"Still you persist? Very well, you may enter."
36497,The streets of Windhelm are now safe. 
36498,Goodness!
36501,"Draw your last breath, mortal!"
36502,I don't know if I can stand the abuse here much longer. They treat us like outcasts.
36503,"The war? That is not a reason to leave, it is a reason to stay."
36504,It takes a lot of confidence to walk around naked. Trust me on that.
36505,"Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important. When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No remorse. "
36507,"He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease the Elves. Elves! Do the Elves rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?"
36508,Hey! I can't see myself! What did you do to me?
36513,And telling her what? That you stole her horse? I don't think so.
36514,Another Dark Elf. Just what Windhelm needs.
36516,What did ya do that for?
36518,You turned me invisible!
36521,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
36523,Concentrate. The battlefield is full of distractions. Ignore them! Focus on your targets.
36525,Be sure to stop by Sadri's Used Wares in the Gray Quarter.
36530,"Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me."
36531,Stormcloaks won't have it though. Too busy keeping the Imperial forces at bay.
36532,Killing someone in a jail is much easier than what the Dark Brotherhood deals with. I guess I wanted to play it safe.
36533,"You better be careful with that magic, if you know what's good for you."
36535,I don't think I'll be content until Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim with the ashes of the Concordat at his feet.
36537,"There's no greater honor than to serve. If you're serious about enlisting, speak to Legate Rikke in Castle Dour."
36539,Fool! The Imperial Legion will have your blood!
36541,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
36542,"They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready."
36545,"Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs. "
36546,"Oh, I doubt that very much. Who would load their ships, then?"
36547,This one thinks you should be more careful with your spells.
36550,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
36552,But I think you'll see that the Legion is Skyrim's only hope for real peace right now. I know you'll make the right choice in the end.
36554,It is whispered that one of the Daedric Princes himself is behind the murder of Elisif. It would seem even the nobility of Oblivion favors our cause.
36555,Keep your distance.
36556,There is no adversary more deadly than a vampire. They are as cruel as they are cunning.
36558,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
36559,Huh. Okay. We'll test your mettle another day.
36563,I don't think we're going to get those potatoes to come in.
36566,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
36567,Sigh. Very well. You're lucky Maramal has placed me in a very forgiving mood.
36569,"Shut it, Kleppr. Thongvor isn't here, so save your kissing up for a Nord who cares."
36570,That spell looks like it'll hurt.
36572,It's wearing a dangerous spell...
36573,Uuh. Would you mind dousing that magic?
36576,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
36579,"Yeah, fie!"
36580,Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?
36582,"Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered with Legionnares. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they still stand."
36583,Shor's bones! What did you do that for? I would have hired the Dark Brotherhood if I'd wanted that! Get away from me.
36584,"I'm a generous man, to those who treat me right. Might be I'll even let you live here with me, if you mind your manners."
36585,"You know, now that I think of it, that sounds fair. Just shove off before the others notice."
36589,The Emperor has requested your signature dish - the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started.
36590,We should go over our strategy again in case the Stormcloaks attack.
36591,"Don't fear the unknown, the hidden, the wretched."
36592,"I got no quarrel with you, but I won't turn one down, neither."
36593,"Assur is going to grow up to be a great man, because he'll have lived through such hardship."
36596,Enjoy the city. It will suit you well.
36598,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
36600,Please! Keep that magic away from me.
36601,Get away from me!
36603,Good luck.
36604,Come here. Let me see your face.
36605,"My lady, there could be agents of the Empire looking for an opportunity like that to have you killed. Are you willing to take that risk?"
36606,"I will have his head for this, I assure you."
36611,Don't come too close with that.
36612,"I'm not forcing him to stay here. I know that he wants a life of adventure, but I've told him before that I can't afford to buy him armor."
36613,"Oh! Bolli... yes, hello."
36614,What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches.
36615,Something's going on here.
36616,See if you can get the door open.
36617,Out the way we came. Hurry!
36619,There's no way out. There's no way out....
36620,We want compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
36621,Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element of surprise. I was lucky... she missed my heart by mere inches.
36622,"I've heard Jaree-Ra is hanging around the Wells District, looking for new blood to hire."
36624,I am so very happy for you. If not a bit... envious.
36628,"Name's Garthar. Remember it, because you're going to hear a lot about me."
36632,Nchuand-Zel? The ruins underneath Markarth? The wealth of artifacts that I've based two human lifetimes of research on?
36633,This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in.
36634,"Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this. It's sort of a tradition around here."
36635,"After we're done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild Master Armor."
36636,"Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for, but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around."
36638,I just hope the bridge survives the war. It's the only place you can cross the Karth river for a long way in either direction.
36639,Pick a man and put him down. We attack on my signal.
36640,"Yes, and I'm more than happy to give it to you. "
36641,"You're here! I was wondering if that Black Sacrament even worked. I need you to kill a woman, a Poor Fishwife, on the Riften Docks. Here's the gold."
36642,"Why, because I'm a Dunmer? We didn't all grow up in dwarven ruins, you know."
36645,"Yes, of course. This war is causing your woes, it's hardly your fault."
36647,"One snap of her fingers, and you could end up in Riften Jail... or worse."
36648,Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
36649,Come see me in Solitude when this is all done. The Emperor can always use another good soldier.
36651,You have no knowledge of who you speak to. Go away.
36653,I hope so.
36658,"Not a single man or woman in Dawnstar has gotten a good night's rest in days. We keep having the same nightmare, over and over."
36659,"Vivienne, could you check out supplies of mandrake root?"
36663,If you insist. Come on boys. This'll be fun.
36664,"Oh, really? You're just like my brother. Fine, but if you change your mind, I'll be right here."
36666,Even Khajiit have their limits. No.
36667,"Aduri, how come the fields haven't been tilled like I asked?"
36668,Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine. Let me give you the details.
36670,Keep that magic away from me.
36673,And how do you know this?
36674,This is my business. My city. You Empire lovers should learn to stay out of it.
36676,Calm down! Why are you over-reacting? I was going to ask if the two of you are collaborating on research!
36677,"Either way, I came back with meat for the table."
36678,Oooh... pretty colors.
36680,Guard. Prepare the prisoner.
36682,"Good idea, sis. Maybe you ought to be in charge!"
36683,Thank you for your time.
36685,"New here too, eh? It's good to see another Nord. I feared I'd be the only one."
36690,Their defeat was merely a delay.
36691,"Eirid and I are playing Hunt the Elf. It's my job to find the Elf, and kill it dead."
36692,Could it really be?  Wow this is what I've been looking for.
36694,"Wonderful! Here, take this. I hope it's fair compensation."
36696,"I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries."
36697,"I'm here to help you with books, Nirya. That's all."
36699,Shor's Bones! What... what's in this?
36700,Let's hope we succeed.
36701,You're dead!
36702,I pray Talos overlooks our less than honorable approach. But he knows our purpose is just and true. I'm glad you made it out alive.
36703,"You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar."
36704,"You're all heart, Vivienne."
36706,"When we've reclaimed our homeland from the Imperials, we'll take the fight to the Thalmor. They are the true enemy. Make no mistake."
36707,Good journey to you.
36709,"Oh, Cicero has returned! Not to kill the kind Listener, but to serve, until one of us dies horribly, in service to our Mother! Best friends forever!"
36711,Agna once told me there is a secret room deeper in where they buried disgraced members of the family. Maybe that will get us into the main chamber...
36712,You found it! The passage goes through the sarcophagus... I don't like this... but we'd better keep going.
36715,That dark elf is about to be a dead elf.
36716,"That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Not very good at your job, are you?"
36724,"The dead should be made to serve the living, not the other way around! "
36725,"Never mind, I don't care. I'm just glad I don't gotta' work for Maven anymore."
36728,"Sovngarde is a myth, you s'wit! And now you can join your ancestors in service to me!"
36729,"Let's find that Totem, Shield-Sister."
36730,I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat. 
36731,"Ha! We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started."
36733,Stay clear of the Forsworn. Bloodthirsty savages.
36735,Ain't used to strangers here in Riverwood.
36736,I'll start round one. Down the hatch!
36737,Arkay protect you.
36741,"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Sabre Cat pelts."
36744,"Hmm... All right, yes, I see your point. Make the necessary arrangements."
36745,Sorry to hear that.
36748,Old Nord sacrifice place. Be careful around here. Let's look for a way to open the bars.
36749,Have the spirits told you where I may find a wife? One who will be safe from this curse?
36750,"Take the money, just let us go..."
36752,"Awww, well, maybe next time."
36756,"Come on, everyone knows about you and Brynjolf."
36758,We need to get inside. Follow me!
36760,"Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative!"
36763,"You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little place where the wine flows like water. We should head there."
36764,What?
36766,Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about.
36767,You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Keerava.
36768,Tulvur! I've just completed inspection of the farmhouse.
36769,But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.
36770,"Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will."
36771,"That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are Dragonborn, then..."
36772,"If someone found her, she would make an excellent mate."
36773,"On the coldest of nights, in the steam rising from my breath, I see the many faces of the dead."
36776,A fatal mistake!
36777,One thing at a time soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're searching for the crown.
36778,Go ahead... try to Shout.
36779,What was that?
36781,"The Augur is down in the Midden, below the College. I don't recommend going down there unless it's absolutely necessary."
36782,Then let's increase the taxes on the farms and merchants. We can't afford to lose the loyalty of the ship captains.
36783,I know Thieves Guild armor when I see it. You're not fooling anyone.
36784,"Thankfully, Jarl Elisif cares far less about your lost profits than she does about winning the war!"
36786,"I suppose if we do, we will find out just how fast each of us can run."
36787,"I've also heard troubling rumors about dealings between you and the crew of that pirate ship, the Red Wave."
36792,"They definitely have some magic in them, I can tell you that much. But it's nothing I know about."
36793,Brynjolf actually caught me trying to pick his pocket in the market. If he was anyone else I would have gotten away with it.
36794,"Sure, I've got a mark for you. Stole something quite important from a friend of the Guild and we take care of our own. You in?"
36795,Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Been sitting by the fire all day.
36796,"If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all."
36797,Wizards. There oughta be a law against them.
36798,"Aela said we would need a Hagraven's head. I already have one of them, but she said it was a special kind."
36800,"Yes, of course, but Ulfric's message is a powerful one. More of our people flock to his cause every day."
36802,"Wait, so you think we'll be able to harvest some of the sacred trees up there?"
36803,"Oh, you are terrible. You do know that, right? Ha ha ha ha ha.  "
36804,We'll need to visit each home for an assessment.
36806,"It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling."
36807,Is it that time again already?
36811,"Stendarr's Mercy be upon you, for the Vigil has none to spare."
36812,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I imply that you'd be meeting for purposes other than court business? You must forgive me."
36813,"Hold your tongue, Wizard, or you're likely to lose it."
36814,"I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally."
36816,Our order will not forget your deeds.
36817,"In exchange, the people of Cyrodiil sleep peacefully, knowing their northern border is guarded by the fiercest warriors in all Tamriel."
36818,"A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare."
36819,"You break it, you buy it."
36820,"General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?"
36821,"My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort."
36823,Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with with the general in person.
36824,Kest...
36826, 
36830,"I think we shall have a grand parade, and let General Tullius march his troops from the Blue Palace to Castle Dour in all their finery."
36832,"Niluva, you promised me you'd pay me back yesterday. So what's the story?"
36835,"After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks."
36837,A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.
36838,No more! I yield! I yield!
36841,"Close the door, then we can talk."
36842,"But when this war is won, I will have my parade!"
36843,That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be crushed nirnroot mixed with water!
36844,I... well. Perhaps. But still! It's curious.
36845,"For what it's worth, I'm sorry to see you go. You fought well for us."
36846,"Oh, very well. I can see there's no changing your stubborn Nord minds."
36847,"Yes, my Jarl."
36848,"We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl."
36852,"Have you decided to do the right thing, Dragonborn?"
36853,"To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the shared blood of the wolf."
36856,Well great! Let's see anyone try to hurt me now...
36858,"There's no refusing a summons from the Greybeards. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your power."
36860,Very true! Hmm. I wonder... do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?
36861,But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.
36866,You should be more careful with your spell casting.
36867,"I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication."
36868,"In any case he won't be turnin' me into no Imperial soldier. I know my place, and it's at your side."
36869,"No disrespect toward the general, but sometimes I wonder if he's got your best interests at heart."
36871,"Ah, the ceremonial juncture. The old Nords used to do sacrifices here. Look around for a way to open those bars."
36873,Hjaalmarch is an important buffer zone between the rebel forces and the capital. Ulfric will try to break through at some point.
36874,And another one for me.
36875,Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim!
36876,Be on your guard. I've no idea what to expect inside the College.
36878,But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to make the forgeries.
36879,"She's locked herself in her room not letting anyone in. Well, except for us servants. She's afraid of assassins coming to get her."
36880,"Here. For you. Don't thank me, just take it."
36881,"The only thing I heard is a rumor that a boy named Aventus Aretino, in Windhelm, has been attempting to contact the Dark Brotherhood."
36882,To kill the Emperor of Tamriel... The Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius.
36883,That's a true Reachman. Hope he heads to Markarth to take out some of those Nords.
36884,Do you hunt? The plains outside Whiterun are ripe with game.
36887,"Ha. A few years ago, I said almost the same thing to a colleague of mine. Well, it turned out he was right and I was wrong."
36891,"I am. The Blades of the 2nd Era hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the beasts lived."
36894,You tried mercenary work? It might suit you.
36895,"Go on, get out of here!"
36896,Put that thing away before someone gets hurt!
36897,Then I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.
36899,You attacked one of my family. What do you have to say for yourself?
36900,"Hey, here. Have one on the house."
36901,Oh yeah? I think so too. You're pretty smart.
36902,May Hircine guide our blades.
36905,"Yes, I've heard the Guild is rising back to power. An alliance would be most beneficial to both parties."
36906,"Who would dare attack the leader of the Companions? In his own hall? There'll be blood for this, I know it."
36907,Did you really see a dragon?
36908,"As long as you can keep things quiet and don't get yourself killed in the process, this place has exactly what we're looking for. You in?"
36910,Those who worship at the shrines will sometimes receive boons from the gods themselves. 
36912,Is that so? You should be. Though a heart without fear is something I can use... Perhaps you are the one I seek.
36913,And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He lacked the loyalty you obviously possess.
36914,Grah!
36916,"My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back."
36917,No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.
36918,The Thalmor ambassador delivered his ultimatum to the Emperor Titus Mede: the heads of every Blades agent within the Aldmeri Dominion.
36919,Return anytime. You're quite welcome here.
36921,Turn my back on these people when their lives could be at stake? I should say not.
36923,Get over to our camp in the Reach. They need every able body they can muster.
36925,Your call. Might be safer to travel separately - attract less attention that way.
36926,"Well, I see your wounds have healed but your pride still needs some time."
36927,Very good. I'll trust you to get there in one piece. Don't be long.
36928,Your objective is the enemy held fort.
36930,Well...that's disappointing. This one didn't survive the fall either.
36931,Very well.
36932,"To receive the blessing of Talos, you have only to pray at the altar."
36934,No matter. Another one will be along any time now.
36935,I... I think I need to stop talking now...
36936,All over now.
36938,"Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?"
36940,The Aldmeri Dominion is the only thing keeping the Empire on its feet.
36946,Oh? Where?
36949,"Embers lie nestled in stone, needing only fuel to bloom to a flame that will warm all around them."
36950,"Unfortunately for you, we don't allow the uninitiated into the inner sanctum. "
36951,Hurrah! Hurrah!
36953,"Then I thank Lady Mara with all my heart; for you, for our child and for our love."
36954,"You, my friend, need practice..."
36955,"I don't believe it. I made that bow myself. Been through some messes with it, let me tell you."
36956,"Aye, Dragonborn. Maybe you can stop the dragons - and this war into the bargain."
36957,"You're not a thief trying to rob me, right?"
36959,"I'll let them into the house and, you know, show them where everything is..."
36963,"He even has some wolves guarding it. I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it."
36965,"Look at you, up to no good."
36966,What? Why are you skulking about like that?
36967,Keep your nose clean.
36969,Umm... are you in trouble? Is that why you're hiding like that?
36970,"It will keep it's hands to itself, yes?"
36971,"Greetings, Shield-Brother."
36973, 
36980,"Oh, and if you bump into Indaryn from the meadery, keep your mouth shut. He'd rat us out in a second."
36981,We've got to find a way to put a stop to this.
36984,We had that beast contained. And you released it! Why? Why would you do such a thing?
36986,Forget it. I don't do that kind of work.
36987,Vals Veran. My family has never really seen eye to eye with him and he has finally gone off the deep end.
36990,"My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I don't think I can take him by myself."
36991,"No offense, I mean I'm sure you aren't into any of that kind of stuff."
36992,"Disrupt my Arcanaeum, and I will have you torn apart by angry Atronachs."
36996,"Heard about what you did. Killing those foul witches. Well done, Companion."
36997,Where is he? The one who was asking about the fugitive hiding in the Ratway?
36999,You'd better clear out before someone gets hurt.
37000,Your lack of cooperation has been noted. We'll be back if we require further information. You won't get a second chance.
37001,I hope I didn't scare you.
37002,"Father, why do you and mother fight so much?"
37005,"Ah, I see. Well, just be careful around my things!"
37006,It's a blessing given to some of us. We can be like wild beasts. Fearsome.
37009,"No, only members of the Circle get this blessing. Right now we're just seeing if you're worth keeping around."
37010,"""Eyes on the prey, not the horizon."""
37011,"Oh, no. Only the Circle have the beastblood. Prove your honor to be a Companion."
37016,I'm a cripple. I have a reason to be drinking.
37017,Thanks for the business.
37018,"I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of mine."
37020,You had your chance to talk!
37022,"In Black Marsh, tradition dictates we present a potential mate a unique wedding ring to represent our future bond."
37024,"Well. You must have all those annoying gods on your side to have made it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit, that's pretty impressive."
37026,We could always use help picking crops if you need a few extra coins.
37027,What are you doing?
37028,"Kodlak White-Mane has been laid to rest, I know. May his soul live forever in the halls of Sovngarde."
37029,"Sorry, guess it's too rich for your blood. Come back when you find the coin."
37030,The docks can be a dangerous place. Don't expect me to save you if you fall in.
37032,"Mining is hard work, but we pay a fair price for any ore you dig up."
37037,"Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?"
37044,"I have a... friend, let's say, who's interested in a staff. A particular one."
37045,Good. Kleppr will pay you as soon as you arrive with the letter. Here you are.
37051,"So we'll be needing fresh horses, then?"
37054,"You've done more than enough already. You've been a good friend in a time of need, and we won't forget that."
37063,"Goodbye, dear."
37064,"Ah yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to break into my laboratory."
37068,"Museums, keeps, estates... you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we must have had a few dozen."
37070,"Once the sun goes down, it's just me and the dogs. They keep me warm, and don't talk too much."
37074,You put those Forsworn down. Good job.
37076,"Well, probably not like these. The ones in there are all still walking around."
37077,No more nightmares. Thank the gods for that.
37078,"J'zargo gives you plenty of these scrolls, so you try them and return when you can say whether they work."
37079,"You mean... there's still a chance? But how? Our plan has gone to ruin, everyone is dead, the Family..."
37082,"With those three vessels, Hevnoraak can restore himself. Find them before he can."
37086,I think it's time for you to get going.
37087,"Well, I'm proud of both of you. I haven't been so busy since those nobles from Solitude come into the city three years ago."
37088,I'm not so sure we should be here.
37089,"If a Stormcloak uses one of my swords to strike down an Imperial soldier, then I've done my part to free our land."
37091,That's...that's...wow.
37097,Come on inside. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell us what happened.
37099,I'd like nothing more than to see Winterhold regain its former glory.
37100,My girl likes to work the forge with her papa.
37103,Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was.
37104,And yet they want to heap the fault on my family's good name? Bah.
37106,"No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take your orders from me. Are we clear on that?"
37108,He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in.
37109,You there. Are you here to kill me? Slay the mighty Logrolf while he sits tied and helpless?
37113,You were given Namira's ring? A great honor.
37116,What about Mercer? Have you asked him?
37117,"No. I think if I was a young man, I would have done the same."
37118,"Ah, yes. Well, I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later."
37121,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
37122,I swear it rains like this every time I go to Riften.
37124,"So. Arngeir, is it? You know why we're here. Are you going to let us in or not?"
37125,That's right. You're the sellsword. Thank you again. It's so nice to have help with my husband gone. Shame what happened to him.
37128,"Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words."
37129,You buy a war dog from me? There's a reason why my hounds are so eager to bite into people.
37130,"Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that spiced beef, now."
37131,Don't go talking about that. Only the dinner guests can know.
37133,"Better if we don't talk about that. As far as anyone's concerned, we all had dinner at a nice inn along the road, and nothing strange happened."
37135,It's so good to have everyone around the table again.
37140,"When was your first meal, Banning?"
37141,Both sides want to tell you how you should live your life. Guess I'd rather hear it from a real Nord than some Emperor down south. 
37149,"In any event, nice work. Here's your payment."
37150,"My friend Marex. We were hunting, and I thought he was an elk."
37151,It shouldn't be. You'll be back to normal in no time.
37152,I trust you have good news for me.
37153,I always preferred the liver myself. My brother had such a juicy liver.
37155,"Thank you, Lisbet. It's been such a joy to dine with you all these years."
37156,"The Silver-Bloods run nearly all the lands in this Hold, as well as the local inn."
37157,"I always leave room for the main course, Eola."
37162,"So far. I just hope things remain calm. Wine gets drunk, tempers flare. This may be a joyous celebration, but it's shadowed by a lot of animosity."
37164,The honor will be mine.
37166,Did you look behind the forge? I think I saw it there.
37167,"I most certainly am not. I've just lost my daughter to a Nord beast, and my nephew Titus is too busy playing Emperor to even show up. "
37171,"Inside the mind of Pelagius, silly."
37173,"Not that I mind the break, of course. But, still..."
37174, 
37176,Not just the men. The Greybeards seem to think the same thing.
37177,She's dead! On my watch! This won't stand!
37178,"Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Sister to the Orcs."
37179,Now let's keep moving.
37180,I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.
37182,"Was in over her head, I'm afraid."
37183,"You ever need my steel by your side, you just ask."
37185,"No. Even after Istlod died, the moot voted to make Torygg High King of Skyrim."
37188,I've come to rely on you. There's something I want you to have. It was my father's. It would be my honor if you carried it.
37189,"But you don't have to stay, if you don't want to. I'll see you back at Jorrvaskr. Stories to tell the others, eh? "
37192,Found this among the dead. Something tells me I should give it to you.
37193,We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the capital. I thought you should be the one to have it.
37194,He did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
37195,But I'm disappointed to hear you ran away from the battle. The gods do not reward cowardice. Nor do I. I expect better from you.
37197,"The love of the land and her people flows from your heart, even as death to her enemies flows from your hands."
37199,"Them Imperials left me to die in Anvil, and I had to fight my way back home. Then they followed me back here!"
37203,You've become a true hero of Skyrim. I number you among my kin. You shall now be known as Stormblade.
37204,"You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause."
37205,"All right. If I make it back to Windhelm, I'll make sure Ulfric knows how you helped me."
37206,Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer now.
37210,"We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has seeped into your heart."
37211,"However, I'm disappointed to hear that you fled from the field of battle. We do not reward cowardice in the Legion. I expect better of you."
37215,Mercer took everything. Even all of our plans are gone.
37217,I have come to rely heavily upon you. It is only fitting that you join the upper echelon. I am hereby elevating you to the rank of Legate.
37221,You've come a long way. I don't think we could do without you. I'm hereby raising you to Tribune. Congratulations.
37222,"Yes, what about the Lady Elisif? "
37223,"Please my lord, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?"
37225,It's starting to look like Esbern was right.
37228,Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers.
37229,"Don't mind them. Just working out some issues, in the old way."
37230,Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way.
37231,Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars are won by talented and exceptional individuals.
37232,"Take this blade, a symbol of your new station and responsibility. I'll keep an eye on your progress. The Empire rewards excellence, and so do I."
37237,"You've no hope of defeating me, pup. Don't bother. Why not broker a bargain, instead?"
37238,I'm glad we liberated the Rift. It was dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
37239,Make sure to get yourself something to drink.
37240,Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
37241,I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.
37242,You'll be well paid for your time.
37243,Hrargh!
37244,"We got a few pieces of jewelry at the Prawn, Madesi. Want to come take a look at them later?"
37245,"What can I get for you, sir?"
37246,I'm glad we've finally restored the Pale. It was extremely foolish giving the Empire control of another port.
37247,"I think that maybe Kodlak was right. As a werewolf, I can't be a good Nord."
37248,The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.
37249,Alright. I believe you. You aren't the first to turn away from the Empire in disgust.
37250,I don't have time for idle chit-chat. What is it?
37251,"The Companions can help protect the city, and the Emperor will be in our debt."
37252,"Are you sure? Once I exchange it for you, I'm not taking it back... unless you want to sell it at a discount of course."
37257,"Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude."
37258,"The Empire's ravenous hunger for Skyrim's silver makes them fierce. But rest assured, we'll win the Reach and wrest it from their greedy paws."
37259,I almost can't believe it. The Empire has been defeated. The world bears witness to the power and righteousness of the sons and daughters of Skyrim.
37261,We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.
37262,Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.
37263,"We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate."
37264,"So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion."
37266,"So you bought Vlindrel Hall, eh? Wish I could afford a house that nice."
37267,"I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting."
37268,You ready to go yet?
37269,"Well, that is how the rest of us learn Shouts. As Dragonborn, you can absorb a slain dragon's life force and knowledge directly."
37270,Don't have any that are for sale right now.
37272,"Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until I'm ready to march on Windhelm."
37273,Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.
37274,It's over.
37277,"Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?"
37278,"Despite your misfortunes, you stayed true to the Dark Brotherhood. You've saved us all, and for this you have my eternal thanks."
37279,"I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back."
37285,"Your targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and Beitild, a mine boss."
37286,"By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him."
37288,You wear the armor of a mercenary. Now that's the life.
37289,I'm losing my patience with this damn war. We must take Hjaalmarch back! The Stormcloaks will be beating upon the doors of the capital soon.
37290,Shor's bones. We were too late. Damn the Empire.
37291,Keep watch in the Stone Quarter tomorrow night. That's almost certainly where the killer will strike next.
37292,"If you change your mind, you know where to find me."
37294,Good luck. Mara bless you.
37297,"Matter of fact, I do. They've been fair enough with me, far as I can tell."
37299,Victory is yours! I submit!
37303,Nirya...
37304,Make it quick. I get enough delays from politicians.
37305,Now that was a battle!
37306,Something to report?
37308,"Oh, got a bit of an interest in your boss do you?"
37310,Yeah! It'll teach them to steal from us! One of them took my good helmet.
37312,"And what did Torygg do? He and the Jarls that supported him? They took the Emperor's gold. Sold out their people for a slave master's ""peace treaty."""
37313,"Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago... before they became the blind monstrosities they are today."
37315,"Dum, di di dum, dum di dum, dum di di di di dum da da dum."
37317,"Ba ba ba, bum ba, ba ba ba, bum ba, ba da da da, dum da da..."
37319,"Dum, di di dum, dum di dum, dum di di di di dum da da dum."
37320,"In fact, I need to arrange for someone to pick up an ore sample for me in Shor's Stone... goodness knows Elgrim won't lift a finger to do it."
37321,"La la la, do do do do do, dum de dum dum... "
37322,"La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la. La la la, la la la la la laaaaaahhhh..."
37323,Hmm... what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used for.
37324,Aaaaiiiiieeee!
37325,"So it will be. Malacath has spoken, Yamarz. Your path is clear."
37326,"I had particularly high hopes for her. Once she'd overcome her difficulties, she could have been quite successful here."
37327,The bride has been murdered! Somebody help!
37328,They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a closet somewhere.
37329,"So... a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age."
37331,We're close now. I can see the camp.
37334,"Pride of the what? This isn't the Legion, boss. We're miners, not soldiers."
37335,But... That doesn't mean there isn't more out there.
37336,I daresay you've learned all I can teach you.
37338,"Over the years I've heard things. Powerful magics lost to the ages, incredible spells that only the most skilled mages can master."
37339,Where else would we be?
37342,"Try Hulda, the innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market."
37344,Go... go right ahead then. Don't let me keep you.
37346,"Please hurry, we need to catch Mercer before he leaves Skyrim."
37352,We're with you!
37353,Have you found proof of Alva's treachery?
37354,"Hrmmm. Pick up your trash, fetcher."
37355,Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments!
37356,"Dear sister. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated."
37358,Look at that. Am I drunk? I must be drunk.
37359,"Fihada, where did you learn how to make bows so well?"
37360,"They live in seclusion on the slopes of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim."
37361,Pay you to protect me? You can't even protect yourselves!
37363,Let's move out.
37364,"Hurry up with it, we've got a merchant in the pit to take care of after we carve this thing up."
37365,I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a little while. Lead on.
37366,Be a lot safer just to have the Jarl's wizard teach you a thing or two.
37367,Don't forget us if you need supplies for your journey.
37368,"Be careful, the road to Shor's Stone could be dangerous."
37369,You didn't need to leave so soon.
37370,"Yes, yes... goodbye."
37372,Quicksilver ore is rare. Worth digging.
37373,"Watch yourself around here, it isn't safe."
37374,Just stay away from me and I'll forget we had this discussion.
37375,"If that's taken into account, these results make more sense."
37377,"Okay, now where did I put those spiders?"
37378,Now get out of my house!
37379,"The Forsworn aren't our real concern, defeating the Imperials and making sure we keep control of this city is."
37383,I'm keeping my eye on you.
37384,"You were charged with keeping us inside the walls. Have faith, Ugor. I only wish the best for our tribe."
37387,You're welcome in Riften as long as you continue to obey our laws.
37388,"No! Aunt Agna! Talos, why didn't I go in with her?"
37391,And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the sewer.
37392,"Be cautious, the pilgrimage to the Shrine is not an easy one."
37393,It's the root that looks like an ugly little man.
37394,"""No matter what, we stay together"", Hafnar said. I looked him in the eyes and lied to him."
37395,"Remember, keep this to yourself."
37396,A Dreth never forgets a friend.
37397,What am I going to do?
37398,Any healing potion will do. Please hurry.
37400,It's nice to be rid of that detestable dog. Things are so much more fun without his incessant preaching.
37402,You there. I don't think I've seen you around before.
37404,"You've been kind, I thank you."
37405,What sort of harm? Have you had a vision?
37406,I've been in charge of Dawnstar for over 35 years.
37407,"Ah, an excellent question. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Lord of Change, Destruction, and Ambition."
37408,Try and get those marks without violence please. I don't want to be responsible for their deaths... or yours.
37410,I don't know why I bother.
37411,You represent Mara now. Set an example for all.
37412,The waiting... the insufferable waiting.
37413,You'd do well to remember who's in charge around here.
37414,You'd do well to remember who's really in charge around here.
37415,Luck? I think it has more to do with the hard work and good soil.
37417,My experiments can't be completed until you've brought me those ingredients. Do hurry.
37419,One thing's certain. I intend to find out before she draws her last breath.
37420,Don't forget to check your supply chest from time to time.
37421,Good steel's worth every septim. Remember that. 
37424,"This here is Dragonsreach, an' it's my task to see it looks fit for a jarl, night an' day."
37425,I'm going to find whoever did this.
37426,Are you bothering me for a reason?
37427,Don't worry about me. I know how to lay low.
37430,I believe we're done.
37431,Visit me anytime. I'm not going anywhere soon.
37433,"When I find that bitch, I'm going to wring her little neck."
37434,Excuse me.
37435,Remember to give at the temple.
37436,You need to teach him a lesson... show him the penalty for betrayal around here.
37437,"Well, that was important."
37439,Farewell.
37440,Talos guide you.
37442,"I'd travel more, but who wants to deal with all the soldiers these days?"
37445,"Ha! There's nothing like a few cuts and bruises to drive home a point, huh?"
37446,"Farewell, kinsman."
37447,Imperial bastard.
37448,"You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open this door and we can get you on your way."
37450,"You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here."
37451,"Look around all you want, but don't try anything funny."
37454,Is... is someone there?
37456,Thanks for your business.
37462,"Good journey, marsh-friend."
37463,"Safe travels, landstrider."
37467,"It's back to work, then."
37468,Come back when you're ready to spend more gold... goodness knows I could use it.
37469,Keep your belly full and your shoulders strong.
37471,The Thieves Guild has been pushing hard to regain a foothold in this city. Rumor has it they're falling apart from the inside.
37472,Keep your eyes to the road.
37473,"I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves."
37475,I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.
37476,Just... Just bring me some Dwemer cogs. I need to examine them for the methods used in forging them.
37479,"If there's nothing else, I really must ask you to leave."
37483,Good friends and neighbors.
37484,Honored guests.
37485,"You really think I can be a blacksmith someday, papa? As good as Eorlund Gray-Mane? Or maybe... even as good as you?"
37487,"Without that amulet, I'm powerless to confront them. Would you be willing to search for it?"
37491,"Are you all enjoying yourselves? Please, eat, drink, and make merry on this most happy of days."
37494,"You are the best Septim that's ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a dragon god, and that's hardly sporting..."
37495,"Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves."
37497,Those draugr are going to come up and kill us all.
37498,"Is that so? And what were you thinking, exactly?"
37499,"I guess we should have expected this response, hmm?"
37502,"Ah, but there I go, waxing poetic about my misspent youth. Now where were we? Ah yes. You're the mortal messenger. An I am...? "
37503,I'm looking for a necklace. Do you have anything with garnets?
37505,We want compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
37506,Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand when the chaos erupted.
37507,"Shout at us, and let us taste of your Voice."
37508,It was that power that brought me to the attention of the Thalmor. In the Summerset Isles it is a great honor to be chosen to serve the Thalmor.
37512,We killed it! I can't believe it!
37514,The Gildergreen blooms again. All thanks to you.
37516,Everybody get back!
37517,Please stop looking at me like that.
37522,"Well, yes. I mean, no. That is, it might, but I'm not completely sure. I'm no tonal architect, I've only read their writings. Scraps, really."
37524,That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn.
37526,"There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever."
37527,Precious release...
37529,But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. You must be one!
37531,"No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here."
37533,"You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily."
37534,"Please, don't kill me!"
37535,No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception.
37536,"Yes, let's get down to it."
37538,Don't like those eyes you got. There's a bad hunger to them.
37540,What's your business here in Winterhold?
37543,Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.
37545,Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference.
37546,"That'd be great. There's a case of our soon-to-be famous mead that needs to get to Winterhold. Get it there, and you can keep the delivery fee."
37547,"Your political affairs are your own, but any allegiance you may have in the ongoing war could very well affect your access to Fort Greymoor."
37548,"Yes, Madame Ambassador."
37549,And their arm.
37550,"Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?"
37551,Elisif! I said I'd handle it.
37552,Oh you're back. Do you still think you could stand as a Companion?
37553,Thanks. I guess.
37554,"If you want in, Calcelmo has to give his say-so. He's usually in front of Nchuand-Zel. Just down the tunnel."
37555,"Please, stranger! I need your help!"
37557,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
37560,"I. I don't know, it wasn't me. I swear!"
37563,"Father, I promise you, this has nothing to do with Empires or politics. It's just business."
37564,Ahh!
37566,"He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry."
37567,"The old man said to have a look at you, so let's do this."
37568,Not here. Out in the yard. Come on.
37570,I'll consider it. Many of the people I deal with are... secretive. You know how it is.
37571,These are the terms currently on the table.
37572,Now that's impressive. You're mightier than you look.
37573,Not bad. Next time won't be so easy. 
37575,"Oh, don't worry too much about it. They were all whelps once. They just might not like to talk about it."
37577,My name is Eorlund Gray-Mane. I work the Skyforge. Best steel in all of Skyrim. All of Tamriel.
37582,"Is that so, Erikur? And you with such delicate sensibilities. It must have been most upsetting."
37584,"Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had already been discovered and foiled."
37585,"Kodlak is the Harbinger, and he's a sort of advisor for the whole group, but every man is his own. Every woman, her own. "
37586,"It's where a client pays you to get arrested, and you get thrown into a prison for the express purpose of breaking out."
37587,I have a favor to ask.
37591,Well done.
37592,"I've got a hungry daughter to feed, so selling my produce is really the only thing I care about."
37593,Help me out of here!
37594,Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave.
37595,"Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Good to see you made it up here."
37596,"I don't dare show my face, lest they recognize me, so you'll have to find out where they are. "
37602,You know this one? I saw him training in the yard with Vilkas.
37604,Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.
37606,Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?
37608,There you are. I had wondered where you got to.
37609,"Don't let my brother get to you, Tekla. You're doing a fine job around here."
37612,"When the Empire surrendered to the Aldmeri Dominion, they shamed us all!"
37615,"Stubborn or not, he's the only contact we've got at the East Empire Company."
37616,"Ah, a woman who lets her actions speak for her. I knew there was something I liked about you."
37618,Back with good news I trust.
37620,"Seriously, you don't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak himself."
37621,"Ah, a man of action."
37623,"I like your fire, though. You'll make a fierce Companion. Let us hunt together sometime."
37625,"We're doomed. The mine is going to stay closed, and we'll up be carted of to Cidhna Mine as slaves."
37627,"Woah, ease up there. We're rough, but there's no need to kill a Shield-Brother over a dispute. "
37629,"Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head."
37630,Farkas!
37632,You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that.
37634,Show this new blood where the rest of the whelps sleep.
37635,"Of course we did, icebrain."
37636,He becomes a full-fledged member of the Bards College. Please welcome our newest Bard!
37638,I expect to be informed if they make any future attempts to contact you.
37639,"Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they are good people."
37640,"At the end of the day, I'm the last line of defense for the Jarl. I will not allow her to fall."
37642,"If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip."
37643,"I guessed right! I... I always imagined the great Gourmet was a Wood Elf. You see, only someone with a knowledge of woodland herbs could combine..."
37645,The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're tired.
37647,Come to me or Aela if you're looking for work.
37649,"All right, so here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you. "
37650,"Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it."
37651,"I'm good at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know."
37653,"You're not afraid, are you? Of animals? Come back when you find your spine."
37654,I knew we could count on you. Get it taken care of right away. Nobody wants an animal left roaming around in their place. 
37655,Be cautious. Beasts are not nearly as predictable as men. Give the thing a quick death.
37658,Come on! Before the dragon brings down the whole tower!
37659,Looks like someone's been digging here. And recently.
37660,Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to Jorrvaskr on my back.
37661,Shor's bones... how did they find this place?
37663,"Let's hope that's the last of them. Come on, let's see what's down this way."
37664,"Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur."
37668,"Fine, I'll get someone else to take care of it."
37671,"Prove worthy by warrior's test, and cross the bridge to the blessed hall."
37672,"The path is closed, till your courage is tested."
37673,Never mind. I can see that these are the best terms we'll get from this council.
37676,"No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out."
37677,It's not confusing... just frustrating.
37679,I've waited long for such a worthy opponent.
37680,You'll have to take it from me.
37683,"Use Dragonrend, to drag him down!"
37685,"Gal like you needs a warhorse, I reckon."
37686,"Die, World-Eater, in despair and fear!"
37687,Nowhere to hide! Hunter becomes our prey!
37688,My sword will taste of your blood!
37689,For Sovngarde!
37690,"By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh?"
37691,For the Dragonborn!
37692,You are not worthy of Sovngarde!
37693,You will die for the glory of the Dragonborn!
37694,It is glorious to battle once again in Tamriel!
37697,I shall sing of thee in Sovngarde!
37699,"Esbern cannot elude us, fool."
37701,You should not have meddled in the Thalmor's affairs.
37702,I need some help with this one!
37706,You're starting to make me angry.
37707,Thalmor dog! Death is too good for you.
37708,You've brought this on yourself.
37709,"Go back to Morrowind, Dark Elf maggots! You're not welcome here!"
37710,My family thanks you. Take this as a token of our gratitude.
37711,"Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus. "
37712,"If you still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more than their fair share to give out."
37713,I'm not afraid of you.
37715,"Crawl back into whatever pit spawned you, Orc."
37716,Rexus. The items.
37717,You won't live to see tomorrow!
37719,"It's settled then. Brief as life can be in Skyrim, at least we'll have each other."
37720,"The Blades will never be defeated, Thalmor dog."
37722,"Now it's your turn, Thalmor bitch."
37723,"Well, well, you actually did what you said you were going to do. I'm impressed."
37725,"Lorkhan's eyes, you're an ugly one, aren't you?"
37728,"If you had to kill your own brother to be allowed back home, you'd think twice as well."
37729,"You're not afraid of me, are you?"
37730,Come on. What are you waiting for?
37732,For the Blades!
37733,"Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch."
37735,"Maven be damned. One day, she'll get hers. I can promise you that."
37736,Come on! This is our best chance!
37738,"Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy."
37739,"If the hold is faced with any threats or mysteries of a magical nature, I am called upon to explain things and suggest a course of action."
37740,"When Aventus escaped, Grelod got meaner than ever. I really thought she was going to kill one of us. Guess not!"
37741,"Less talk, more hunt."
37742,Don't let it get too close!
37743,"But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do."
37747,We've got to bring it down!
37748,Ah... the power of the dragon is yours! There can be no doubt that you are the Dragonborn of prophecy.
37752,Shall we get moving?
37754,"I have told Idgrod of your concerns. She'll look after you all. Please, go back to your business."
37755,The dragons will surely fear your Voice.
37757,I'm running low on Grand Soul Gems.
37758,I'll show you to your room. Right this way.
37759,We summon Potema!
37760,Skyrim is the birth place of the Empire. We won't let a bunch of thugs rob her of her lineage.
37761,And I've got better things to do than listen to more of your fantasies.
37762,By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.
37764,Here's your share. Well done.
37767,"Tell you what, if you find the rest of them, talk to me again. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck."
37769,We weep.
37772,All right. I'll fletch some more when I get the time.
37773,On this day... I go to Sovngarde.
37774,Speaking of fortune. Here. Everything I earned from my last shipment. It's yours.
37775,Have you seen Astrid? She needs to speak with you. It seemed urgent. Come talk to me afterward.
37776,Please. Not now. You'll know when I'm ready to discuss the issue.
37777,How much do you know about the brewing of mead?
37778,Well now... would you look at that.
37782,Damn him - the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?
37783,"Hey, good to see you!"
37784,"The wounds are deep, Vilod! I can't stop the blood."
37785,Thanks! I'm going to go put it on right now.
37786,"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
37787,I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
37791,A healing spell? Was that really necessary?
37792,"Well, we have to cut down something!"
37793,"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
37794,We must be getting close. We should proceed cautiously.
37796,I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
37797,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Pale. Congratulations."
37799,"I'll look over this later. Why don't you take this, for your trouble?"
37800,"Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some."
37801,"That's... that's good of you. If you were to save her, I would be very grateful. I don't think there's anything I could give you, though..."
37803,"I'll also notify the guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
37804,I grant you this weapon from the armory to serve as your badge of office.
37805,"It's too cold for my bones, but that never seems to stop you, dear."
37806,"First it was 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Now I'm in for life."
37811,I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
37813,"Once the new owner finds out I gave in, I'm as good as dead anyway."
37815,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Falkreath. Congratulations."
37816,I've heard. Bolli and Keerava were speaking of it just a little while ago.
37817,Did you have any luck talking to my father?
37820,But I'll see for myself soon enough.
37821,"Oh by Azura, I've made a terrible mistake. I bought a gold ring, and Viola Giordano has been missing a ring that looks just like it."
37822,Now my mother's stripped me of my heritage and incarcerated me here like a common criminal and my brother has all but disowned me.
37825,Divines watch over you.
37826,So I hear. You've brought honor to the Companions and yourself.
37828,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
37830,"No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed."
37832,"Come coward, now we fight!"
37833,"The last time I was in Whiterun, the tradesmen were talking about you. It seems your reputation as a businessman is growing."
37834,Glad to hear all my hard work has paid off. Maybe we'll fetch a better price for our crops next time we're in the city.
37837,"I picked up a set of fine silver brushes in the city, Reldith. I thought you might be interested."
37839,"You have to remember, it's not about strength. It's about leverage."
37847,"We don't need your charity, Breton. If my girls deserve something nice, it'll be their father who buys it."
37852,Are you making good progress with the planting?
37853,"So far, things are going well. Let's just hope the weather holds."
37854,"Oh, Talos's breath, Reberrus. Skip ahead to the good part."
37855,"You feel fear for the first time, worm. I see it in your eyes."
37857,"Those little girls of yours are growing like weeds, Lemkil."
37859,"I don't get many customers, but that leaves me time to try things out. Experiment, I guess."
37862,All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.
37863,"Yes, actually. I'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground."
37865,The gods have granted us peace for the moment. But that won't last long. I'm sure trouble will be stirred up soon enough.
37867,"You bring an outsider here, and now insist I call on Malacath for help, when he has clearly forsaken me? You try my patience, Atub."
37871,Then we have a deal.
37877,"I'm not seeing signs of any warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago."
37880,Why don't you head back out to Yngvild and find the rest?
37881,"I miss Valenwood, but the wilds here are... serviceable."
37882,"It's a good start, but you need all four of the volumes or the set isn't complete."
37884,"Here, take this. This should cover your end of the work nicely."
37886,I can't believe it. You have them already?
37888,Point the way.
37889,Please tell me you have news of my son.
37891,"After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again."
37892,Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down.
37895,The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.
37897,"My... eagerness to meet you in battle was my... undoing, Dovahkiin. I salute your, hmm, low cunning in devising such a grahmindol - strategem."
37900,"No politics, Thongvor. I told you before."
37901,"Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar."
37902,"City folk might look down on us, but what's wrong with farming? Everything we've got, we had to earn with our own sweat."
37904,"As promised, here's your payment for bringing them to me. Got it as part of a fair trade from my client."
37905,He might not devour you whole.
37909,We've been contracted to make sure Brand-Shei remembers not to meddle in affairs that aren't his own.
37910,The cycle of retaliation may continue for some time. 
37913,"Never you mind, then. I'll find a more charitable soul."
37914,That's what I thought.
37915,"Oh. No, no, no. Don't you understand? Guilt, innocence, right, wrong.... Irrelevant. What matters is I ordered you to kill someone, and you obeyed."
37919,I want you sellswords out of my mine.
37920,"Hmph. When most would speak, you listen. You think. You understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders. To kill."
37923,We will see if they still remember us.
37924,"On the other hand, you've weeded out the weak from among those who would deign worship me."
37925,"Farewell, Sabjorn."
37926,I hope the Empire is sending reinforcements to drive these heathens out of Whiterun.
37929,"Until the Key is returned, I will never set foot inside that place again."
37930,I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
37932,I've got a recipe for venison stew that I want to try out. Will you have venison anytime soon?
37933,"You were born into the pack, sister."
37936,But Volunruud... that I have heard of. And I know where it is.
37937,"Yes, but there are concerns. Rumors that he's up to something."
37938,This way.
37941,Just because we live in the middle of nowhere doesn't give Ranmir the right to drink himself into oblivion.
37943,True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.
37945,"But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for."
37946,"Long life to you, Thane."
37947,"Remember, we want people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is the custom, and I can promise a bonus."
37948,"The edged lexicon, for inscribing. To us, a hunk of metal. To the Dwemer, a full library of knowings. But... empty."
37949,It's the escaped prisoners!
37950,"Let me guess - you have some ""business"" to discuss..."
37952,You'll pay for this....
37953,Of course. Let me see if we have another bottle of that.
37958,"Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war."
37961,"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
37962,"I handle the burglary, shill, sweep and heist jobs. Most of them involve breaking and entering."
37964,"Fine, tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly."
37969,"I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now."
37970,I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
37972,It is our most favored company.
37975,For Skyrim!
37976,"By the Mane, look. A dwarven city. Still sitting here after thousands of years."
37978,Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you to get in there and get it done.
37980,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Eastmarch. Congratulations."
37981,"As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!"
37982,"If you want to enter Riften, use the North Gate. Otherwise, we have nothing to talk about."
37983,"When I first received the blessing of the wolf, my creator gave me a valuable piece of advice. ""Arnbjorn,"" he said. ""Never lose!"" And I never do. "
37986,Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself.
37987,Seems Kolskeggr Mine got hit by Forsworn. Those madmen get more bold every season.
37988,Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can be expensive.
37989,"So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all you did it clean. I like that."
37990,How about the gold? Did you remember to bring it or is that too difficult an instruction as well.
37991,"But I have many more rooms to clean. Fort Greymoor is quite large, and rather filthy if I do say."
37992,Are you daft? I told you not kill any of them. How much clearer do you need me to be?
37993,"You kill the giant, bring me the hammer. We go back to Largashbur, I tell everyone I did it."
37994,Are you... threatening me? Walk away fool. It's not worth it.
37996,"Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe him my life, in fact."
37997,"For this you have earned the Blessing of Kyne, and can count me as a friend."
37998,"Looking for a horse? You'll want to talk to my father, Geimund."
38001,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
38002,"Now, on to other things."
38003,Karthwasten has enough problems. Leave us alone.
38004,I suppose it's not a total loss then.
38006,"Just browsin' today. If the gods be kind, someone will take mercy on me and spare a few septims."
38007,"If they do, promise you'll actually purchase something for once."
38008,"I joined with Bashnag then, but I thought of Savela every day. So I snuck off, hoping to find and steal away with her."
38009,"By Ysmir, I will. Gods know it's been too long since I tasted real meat."
38010,"Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell. Only the Shatter-Shields appear safe."
38011,"You help my people, and I'll make you my Thane. "
38012,"I doubt Ulfric would let Thalmor into Windhelm without a fight. But please, do continue. How would you help us?"
38013,Certainly. I'll be sure to bring some back for you the next time I go hunting.
38016,"Well, I'm glad we've established this early, rather than me hearing about it years or decades later when the whispers behind my back are loud enough."
38017,"Make it quick, and there might be a bowl of hot stew in it for you."
38018,"Ah, Olfina. How may I help you?"
38020,"Got any sausages? I'm cooking a special breakfast for a friend, and they're his favorite."
38022,"You've got the heart of Mara herself, you know that? Thank you, Carlotta. Thank you."
38024,"We just need the hilt and the pommel, now."
38026,Glad to see you're making new friends. I know Jon's death was hard on you.
38027,"Would your good friend be named Jon, by any chance? I've spied the two of you talking quite intimately."
38028,"If we spend less on new arms and armor for the guards, for example..."
38029,"That's right, mock the town beggar like everyone else. But I've got a right to browse, don't I? I ain't hurtin' anyone."
38030,My pay will be nothing if we die in here!
38031,"Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity!"
38032,A reasonable strategy.
38033,The gods smile on them who show charity. Best you remember that.
38034,Those green apples you sold me the other day were delicious.
38035,J'zargo is going to stay right here until this is all over.
38036,Then the leader of our clan... Garthek... he ordered us to kill the rest.
38038,It's locked for a reason.
38039,I'm sure you could charge double for those and still sell them all within a week.
38042,All right. Let's take a look...
38044,"We accept the risks that come with our faith, but I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you, Niranye."
38045,"I almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon..."
38047,I had to. The farmers are charging me double for the produce I sell.
38048,"Okay, got another one for you."
38049,"Stendarr's Mercy to you. If my Horgeir doesn't give up the mead this time, I'll hit him over the head with it."
38053,"It's the leaving that's hardest, I know."
38054,"They've been raiding the farms for food, and supplies are scarcer than ever. Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead."
38056,"Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him."
38057,"Well then, you won't be leaving here alive!"
38058,Exactly. Road patrols were cut in half because the Jarl needed soldiers. Now the bandits are bolder than ever.
38059,Hmph.
38061,No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!
38062,Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!
38065,We are traveling to the Shrine of Kynareth in Whiterun. I hear the Gildergreen is more beautiful than ever since it's been restored. 
38067,No! There's got to be more Skooma... Shut up! Shut up!  Don't lie to me J'zhar! You hid it! You always try to steal it from me!
38068,"Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason we are."
38069,"Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!"
38071,For the Empire!
38072,A pint of your finest mead.
38075,"The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren."
38076,You should probably speak to her.
38078,"You really don't want to be loitering here, stranger."
38079,"My greatest challenge was deciding which weapon to use, for I am prone to indecision. Bow, dagger... axe? In the end, I opted for my claws."
38080,If only we could get our hands on that treasure. We could get out of here and never look back.
38081,"General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do."
38082,"I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute."
38083,Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence.
38084,"Their spies must've found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us to have it. But they won't stand in our way."
38085,"Bring your coins, but do not bring trouble."
38088,Keep your wits about you and watch your shield brother's back.
38090,"Ulfric Stormcloak is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do."
38091,The Imperials will be sorry they got in our way.
38096,Keep a sharp eye out. There's no telling what we might run into in here.
38097,Careful. No telling what will happen the next time you mess with that door.
38098,My pa always warned me not to mess with places like this.
38099,Korvanjund. Remember?
38102,Now maybe we can put all this behind us.
38103,I've got a sharp woman on the job right now. She should be returning any moment.
38105,Forget the old man. I'll come with you.
38111,Burguk is a fine chief. He brings strength and wealth to the stronghold.
38112,"This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used..."
38114,"It's under your feet, lad. Just follow the smell."
38115,Grrrarrggh!
38119,"I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there are several Khajiit Caravans that travel across the realm."
38121,That would probably be best.
38123,Tell these Horkers to set me free.
38126,"You have earned my favor for now, mortal, and so I give you a little gift. Use it well."
38128,"Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?"
38130,"So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?"
38133,Sometimes it pays to look in every nook and cranny.
38134,And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all.
38135,"Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume."
38136,That should do. Now - Inhale deeply.
38137,"Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them."
38138,"I'll pay to do the same, to a certain special someone. "
38139,"If anything actually happens, call a guard. "
38141,"If the guards in the Gray Quarter weren't a bunch of n'wahs, I wouldn't be here talking to you."
38142,A few dark elves getting shoved around doesn't really amount to much.
38143,"Watch that tongue, Rendar, or your whole lot could be down with the Argonians hauling ballast by tomorrow."
38144,"When I retired here in Windhelm, most folk already knew me as Captain Lonely-Gale, and the name just stuck."
38145,"I was a sailor for many a year. I made my coin as a trader and in time, I bought my own ship."
38149,"He's claimed three victims that I know of, though maybe there's more that haven't been found yet."
38150,"Terrible shame, that. Seems we have a killer on the loose here in Windhelm."
38154,"I'll kill you, I swear it!"
38155,The clans Shatter-Shield and Cruel-Sea see most of the gold that passes through the city.
38156,There's an author named Adonato staying at the inn. He's published a few works of historical fiction.
38159,"If you're need of goods, there's a market. If it's a soft bed and a hot meal you're after, there's Candlehearth Hall."
38160,I'm glad I could help.
38161,"We worship him that we might follow in his path. We can't literally join him in the heavens, but we may do our best to know them here on Nirn."
38165,"Help us, you end up rich. Cross us and you'll end up a memory. Is that enough information for you?"
38167,"You already got what you wanted, you damn hound. This is your fault."
38172,"Skyrim doesn't take kindly to being told what to do. And to try and forget Talos, well... they may as well ordered us all to cut off our ears."
38174,The Empire's elven puppetmasters never cared much for the idea of a human becoming a divine. So the worship of Talos is outlawed. 
38177,"Ulfric prays for strength. I speak to Captain Lonely-Gale, but he doesn't spend much time here. Too busy. "
38178,"Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it."
38181,"You don't have to, because it's utter nonsense. It's never going to work."
38183,"Speak with Ulfric, he's expecting word from Whiterun."
38184,Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design.
38186,We want compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
38188,"Hillevi Cruel-Sea comes in a lot, but I haven't seen her husband here in years. "
38190,I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair hearing.
38191,"Windhelm is the first city on that road, and here we are."
38192,"When the Red Mountain burned, you could scarcely breathe in Morrowind. So we came west. "
38194,Here for a room or something to drink? Show me some coin first.
38195,Did you find anything at Wolfskull Cave?
38196,Do you want me to hold your hand as well?
38201,"I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets. "
38202,"You got me, fair and square. Tell Haran I'll pay."
38203,"Oh... what a terrible shame. Well, if you think you know where you left it and can retrieve it, I'll be here."
38206,"Wasn't enough for me, though. I left. Didn't want to end up as the third wife of some lowly chieftain."
38207,"Speak, I wish to hear everything my subjects have to say."
38208,I simply must have this! I'll pay you double what it's worth.
38211,"You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor."
38212,Wonderful. You've just made an important contribution to the advancement of a Dwemer scholarship.
38213,"I promise you, the thought crossed my mind. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot."
38214,"From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes."
38219,"This message is for me. I understand now. I have work to do. You, I shall need your help."
38221,"Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh?"
38222,"Oh, of course! Because Malacath would take pity on us if only a useless outsider would lend a hand."
38223,"As I mentioned, the amulet I gave you is exceptionally valuable, and will certainly cover the costs of all these other unpleasantries."
38224,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
38225,"Whoa, lad. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?"
38227,Only inside the gates. Much of Falkreath hold is wilderness and there's plenty of trouble to be had.
38228,I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.
38229,But there isn't any other way through.
38230,We grow that much stronger with each son and daughter of Skyrim who joins us. Down with the Emperor!
38232,"Your mockery will be the end of you. And on that day, another servant will feast on your entrails and discover a ring clenched in her teeth."
38233,You have your orders. Get moving.
38235,Outsiders aren't trusted in Markarth. Best keep that in mind.
38236,He expects us to drop our defenses and greet them with open arms... to dialogue with them rather than defend our homeland by spilling their blood.
38239,Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.
38240,We keep hearing that the war could come through here. I try not to worry about it.
38243,"Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead."
38244,"You have someone with you, already."
38246,"What is this madness? Rexus, help me!"
38248,We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house.
38250,Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?
38251,Ah! The Hall of Stories... we must be getting close now.
38252,"It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in a long forsaken cave to the west of here."
38253,Hmm... that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what it's used for.
38254,Look out!
38256,"No, which is fine with me."
38257,We made it. Windhelm. Hope you enjoyed the ride.
38259,Didn't even work up a sweat.
38260,"You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper."
38261,"An archer, eh? Oh, I've got just what you need."
38262,Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll find down here.
38263,"Unblooded, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open."
38264,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Reach.
38265,You see a lever anywhere?
38266,You should look into joining. They could use every hand they can get.
38267,"Good. If Riften should fall, it's only right that its leader be spared."
38268,"That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more..."
38270,I try to think of it as coaxing the ore from the rock.
38273,"Hey, how's it going. Need pickpocket training?"
38274,It was a minor miscalculation. I've already corrected it for future experiments.
38275,"Will he swear fealty to me, that all may know we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?"
38281,Twelve septims on the girl! Look at that speed.
38284,Are you all right? You seem tired.
38285,"The, um, Emperor thanks you... Now shove off!"
38286,"Madesi was actually my original Saxhleel name. Unlike others, I decided to embrace tradition and keep it that way."
38287,"You're new here, right? Welcome to the Bards College. It's like a... musical museum."
38289,Good.
38290,"We don't mistake that for acceptance, though. Odds are they're simply too afraid to confront us directly."
38292,This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.
38294,"Yeah, but Twice-Killed has more of a ring to it!"
38296,"Token, you say? Let me see."
38297,"It's an honor, champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven."
38299,"There, there. It will pass. Going too long without a proper meal can make the stomach weak."
38301,We just got a cask of Old Gold 200 that has a crack in it. Better serve it now before it goes bad.
38302,"Why does Shor forbid us to face Alduin? I fear no worm, World-Eater though he be."
38303,Is someone there?
38304,Do you know what he's talking about?
38305,What's the situation?
38306,"Stormcloaks were already camped out around the entrance when we got here. They don't know we're here yet, though."
38307,"And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, my good lady!"
38308,Skyrim will not bow to a false king any longer. Ulfric is the true king.
38313,"Imperials? Well, if they're keeping themselves comfortable, let's slip in and send them to their graves that way."
38314,"Well, since she's not using it anymore, Ulfric might just let you have it, if you have the money. And if he likes you."
38315,Grelod ain't going to like some stranger just hangin' around. Not that I care.
38316,Go. Quickly. Hide in the coffin before Cicero and the traitor meet.
38317,I seem to recall Mirabelle mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can tell you anything?
38318,Let's also pretend that he traded some valuable items for said staff.
38319,"City's quiet enough now. But when the sun goes down, you best keep on your guard."
38321, 
38323,"Hail, Galmar."
38324,"Their souls are trapped in Oblivion all the same, and here I stay."
38326,We're not leaving until we get what we came for.
38328,Farewell.
38329,"You have the claw. Oh, you have to tell Lucan at once. Hurry!"
38330,"Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information I need."
38332,"Oh, goodbye then."
38334,A group of them has holed up in Falkreath.
38336,"We've been hired to deal with some pests in Hjaalmarch. Someone's got them riled up, and you need to put an end to it."
38339,"No problem, I'll find someone else. Don't worry about it."
38342,I'll begin searching up here.
38343,"It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion."
38345,"So... I've taken us this far, but you need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink."
38347,Gonna split your belly like an old woman's purse!
38348,No matter. You'll take care of things like you always have.
38351,"I call upon you, Lady Mara!"
38352,The Skull hungers. It yearns for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake.
38353,Grant me the power to break through this barrier and to send the Skull to the depths of Oblivion!
38358,Not at all. It's good to be put in your place once in a while.
38362,You there! Ah... citizen. This area is off limits.
38363,What is it?
38364,"See if you can find some, and I'll try to find some more interesting work by the time you get back."
38366,I love this part of the meal.
38369,"Here, take this and don't mention a word of this to anyone, especially Svana!"
38377,Well guess what... now you've inherited their debt. Don't come back to me until you have every last coin.
38380,They should be so lucky.
38382,"New orders for the soldiers, Legate. Make sure they're distributed as noted."
38385,"I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful."
38386,I'll make you pay!
38387,There are no goods to bring to the store. That's what I'm saying.
38388,Wouldn't surprise me. They've done nothing to help in the fight for Skyrim's freedom.
38390,See for yourself.
38396,"Savos wouldn't even grant us an audience when we came to you, but now you come here expecting something from me?"
38397,"You are, are you?"
38400,I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and gotten himself killed just to spite me.
38402,Let's just keep an eye on the supply. It's such a chore to restock.
38405,Of course not. My spirit remains strong.
38406,Helgi. But father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
38407,Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower.
38408,I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.
38410,"I was the one who thought of using this... this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it. Something unpronounceable, I'm sure."
38411,You wish to do what I do? Very well.
38413,You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.
38416,"You remind me of my cousin's cat. Killed that, too!"
38421,"It's full of spiders, that's what's wrong with it! Almost killed Grogmar and me when they showed up."
38422,It's the Legion!
38423,"Here's your payment. And... a little something else, as well. From me. Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly!"
38427,Going to cry now? Huh?
38428,I also want to know how they managed to get the place up and running so quickly.
38430,"You must trust in the rightness of your cause, and the strength of your Voice."
38432,I hope not. This is an important job.
38440,A problem? Let me see it.
38441,"You remind me of the Shadowscales, from the old histories."
38442,He claims you possess some sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find that hard to believe.
38443,The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's assurance you won't botch another assignment.
38444,"Could have been my imagination, I suppose..."
38446,"This... it matches every description of the Phial that I've found in lore. But if it can't hold liquid, there's no way of knowing."
38449,"If you drink too much, you're out. No drunks."
38453,"Hello there, miss."
38454,"If you plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming back."
38456,"Sorry, my lady. I've been looking but I'm convinced Saerlund says truly believes what he is saying."
38457,"I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished."
38459,There you are. 
38460,"Well that's not how I operate, so forget it."
38462,"Oh, very well. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done."
38463,"Well, I know the Companions make their home here. Their mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is the oldest building in the city."
38465,I hope you're not expecting to get paid until the job's done.
38466,"I give, and I give."
38469,"Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness of your heart, would you?"
38471,Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.
38475,My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.
38477,Got of lot of steel to shape.
38478,"He's perfectly polite, if a bit guarded."
38487,New brother. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
38488,"What is that stench? Rotting wood, perhaps? That can't be good."
38491,"Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!"
38492,Get ready to open the trap!
38495,"It took me weeks to find that thieves' den. I can't stop now, and I can't get the sword on my own."
38498,Alduin mahlaan
38500,"But I do realize it's sometimes not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing."
38501,What's the plan?
38503,Sahrot thur qahnaraan
38504,Alduin mahlaan
38505,"Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else."
38506,"Ah, yes. The pirate captain. A ruthless she-devil, by all accounts. Deadly with a blade."
38508,Please... don't dally. I've wasted enough time arguing with my useless assistant here.
38509,Alduin mahlaan
38510,Alduin mahlaan
38511,"The Forsworn follow the old ways, but some of those were best forgotten. Blood sacrifices, communing with Daedra. It's the road to ruin."
38512,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
38513,Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?
38516,"Thanks to all of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate as to whether this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina."
38517,"Daedra take you, then."
38518,Alduin mahlaan
38519,"It won't repair the tree back at the temple, but we could bring them a new one. "
38521,"I don't even care any more. You want to check it out? Fine. I'll sell you the thing for fifty gold, and then it's your problem."
38522,Alduin mahlaan
38523,Can you believe the company won't even dock ships here anymore?
38525,I am waiting for a good death.
38527,Thu'umii los nahlot
38529,"Friend Brunwulf, how good to see you!"
38530,Get down to the front line.
38531,"If those rebels think they can best us, they have another think coming."
38533,Not a peep. Those prissy Bretons can't be made to lift a finger to help their neighbors.
38535,Alduin mahlaan
38536,"Is he with you, Delphine? If so, I advise you to tell him to watch his tongue."
38537,Alduin mahlaan
38538,Alduin mahlaan
38540,Those bears are making Miss Temba so angry. I hope you can do something about them.
38541,Mu los vomir
38542,Alduin mahlaan
38545,"So the Emperor had a decoy. Poor bastard got murdered, too. But then, I guess that was his job..."
38546,Alduin mahlaan
38547,Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine.
38548,"Fralia, do you ever deal with the Khajiit at all? I'm sure they would love to trade in your husband's steel."
38550,"You may care nothing of honor, but I do. I'm not leaving without an apology."
38553,My Erith has her father's eyes. She's all I have left of him.
38554,"Tolfdir normally looks after your little group, yes?"
38555,Alduin mahlaan
38556,And now the Stormcloaks have claimed the entire city. I guess we have Roggvir to thank for that as well.
38557,"So many undesirables to contend with. Naysayers. Buffoons. Detractors. Why, my headsman hasn't slept in three days!"
38562,"Good. I hope it hurt a lot, after all the pain I've been put through."
38563,Alduin mahlaan
38564,Alduin mahlaan
38566,Alduin mahlaan
38567,Alduin mahlaan
38568,This better be important.
38569,Alduin mahlaan
38570,Hmph. Most certainly not. But perhaps I can teach you how to put some candles out. We'll start there. 
38572,Alduin mahlaan
38573,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in Eastmarch.
38575,"You've done it! Now, if I can only remember what we were originally talking about."
38576,"But willing or no, they will hear it! Fare thee well, Dovahkiin!"
38578,They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.
38579,I'm Ghorza's assistant. I help her with the forge.
38581,"Many of the dovahhe are now scattered across Keizaal. Without Alduin's lordship, they may yet bow to the vahzen... rightness of my Thu'um."
38585,You've returned. Good. What did you find at Wolfskull Cave?
38586,Is it true that you kill deer and eat their hearts?
38587,Skald is very... vocal about his hatred of the Empire.
38588,"Yes, my lady?"
38589,"This temple is dedicated to Mara, and the light of love she shines on us all."
38592,"One way or another, get me those documents."
38593,"A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves."
38594,"For the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs."
38597,I can provide you with some help with her minions. 
38600,"I'll see you again soon, I hope."
38603,Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.
38607,"But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray, that one will come to hear her say... "
38608,Fie!
38610,"All right. Back to slicing, dicing and baking."
38612,There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered Gallus... a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum.
38613,I'll read it. Thank you.
38614,"If you think you can hold Markarth, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor."
38615,"Hasn't she told you? We were both Blades, back when that still meant something."
38616,Why would anyone want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense.
38620,I hope Falk made it clear that Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
38621,In case Falk doesn't make it clear - Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
38626,Ainethach's in charge of Karthwasten. You should bother him.
38627,Not that it matters anymore. No one bothers coming to Winterhold for any other reason. 
38628,Not like that it isn't.
38629,I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an ambush.
38632,"Don't have to tell me twice. But then, I'm not the one that buried iron under these mountains."
38634,You'll meet a lot of tongue-wagging gossips in this town. Try not to take them too seriously.
38635,The Blades! Of course. They specialize in meddling in matters they barely understand. Their reckless arrogance knows no bounds.
38638,You will release me - ro laan - if in return I promise to take you to Skuldafn and stop helping Alduin? 
38640,"Look, I only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those stones unless they have the whole set."
38641,"So, you've got two options. Try to find Agallon yourself, somewhere on his route between the major cities. Or... find and steal his schedule."
38642,Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?
38647,Just kill him and let's be done with it already.
38650,"If you can bring it back, we could restore the paragon... and reap its benefits."
38651,I have it on good authority that the crown is within Tolvald's Cave; dropped by a Dunmer caravan leaving Morrowind long ago.
38653,"Well, I'm not one to welch on a deal, so here's your reward. I hope you put it to good use. I know I have."
38655,I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years.
38656,"You don't want to go up to that farmhouse, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife, slaughtered in the night. So many knife wounds..."
38659,Many used to come to these caves. The forgotten. The wretched.
38661,"I can ask no more. Thank you, my lord!"
38663,"Mara, I forgot how late it was. Need to lock up the shop."
38664,"Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften."
38665,"You're not going to shoot, right?"
38666,Are you ready for me to show Azura her Star and receive her wisdom?
38667,I should lock up the store now. Thank you again.
38668,What have you done?
38674,"I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't have the time or patience to be ""nice."""
38675,Ohh... ughh...
38676,"Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people. When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times... some times I got carried away?"
38677,"In time, I believe I will."
38684,He usually knows what's going in and out of that place. Thankfully that means I don't have to.
38687,"Fool! Don't you get it? I live in the shadow of death every day. A knife in every doorway, a nocked arrow on every rooftop!"
38689,I can't believe how lucky we got landing this job. It's a far cry from working for the Stormcloaks.
38690,Please place your hands on the altar. Azura wishes to speak with you.
38691,As you may be aware Elisif's husband High King Torygg was recently killed.
38693,Need a ride?
38695,"More importanly, he's pledged the full support of the Battle-Born clan to the Thieves Guild."
38698,Yol...
38699,"Please, mister. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us."
38701,"Sir, are you serious?"
38702,"Here, I have a delivery I need to make to Calcelmo. Why don't you take it to him? He knows the history of Markarth better than anyone."
38703,Good enough for me. It's the one with the saddle.
38704,"I wished you could have sent more of a message to those Summerset Shadows upstarts, but hopefully they'll stay out of our business."
38705,"At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm."
38709,You look like you could use a drink. What do you say to some cheap mead?
38715,It's nice to shake the cobwebs off and get things rollin' again. Keep this up and I can see a bounty headed our way.
38717,I think you'll find that the Guild is beginnin' to grow. We've had a merchant move into the space right outside the Flagon.
38718,"We've got a long way to go, but don't let that bother you... it's a lot farther than we've been in years."
38719,You're a natural. Never seen anythin' like it.
38720,We showed those Imperials what real Nords are made of!
38722,"I've been away from Solitude for as long as I can. But if you decide to finish these bandits off, you'll be rewarded for your efforts."
38723,Success means that the Guild is gettin' stronger. We've picked up another merchant and a new recruit.
38724,"When you walk through the Guild, don't be ashamed to hold your head high 'cause you're the best damn thief in the place."
38726,"I'm goin' to tell you'll somethin' you'll never hear me say again, and if you tell anyone I told you, I'll deny it."
38727,Let's kill him!
38728,"In fact, I just got a special job request in. I haven't gotten anythin' like it in years."
38730,Our wedding is soon. I'll see you then!
38731,"He's nothing more than a barbarian renegade, whose lust for power has cost the lives of countless innocents."
38732,Your death will be my triumph!
38733,"Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work."
38736,A word of warning though... I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.
38737,I've got another special request and they specifically asked for you.
38739,"Now, if you're ready, I got another special job for you."
38740,"My job at the Riften Fishery is in danger. The owner, Bolli, said that if I show up for work in this condition one more time, then I'm out."
38741,Happy hunting.
38743,"I don't know what your made of, but I've never seen anyone tackle this many jobs without endin' up dead or in jail."
38748,"Well, I never thought I'd see the Guild this way ever again. The place is growin' into what it used to be when Gallus was runnin' the show."
38752,"If you wish to make a donation to her Benevolence, speak to Maramal and ensure your true love will endure for all eternity."
38755,"Now, he's not exactly goin' to welcome you with open arms, but keep your cool. Do this job right and we've just made an important friend out there."
38756,I need you to make your way to Solitude and talk to Erikur. He's lookin' to run some kind of a shill job.
38757,It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.
38759,"Along the fence, do you see them?"
38760,Items? What items? Let me see those.
38761,"His father was a good friend of the Guild back in the day, and we could really use his family's influence back on our side."
38762,I want you to head out to Markarth and speak to Endon. He's a silversmith... has some kind of a shop there.
38763,Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.
38764,"Ah, yes. Umm, no. No, I don't think so. Not at this point."
38766,"We actually got a request from one of the most powerful families in Whiterun, the Battle-Born's."
38769,"Khajiit welcomes you, and also your coin."
38770,The Imperials wouldn't have just let you walk away. Remember that.
38772,Find me the moment the Alik'r are taken care of.
38773,"I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me."
38774,You listen to me. I'd be careful wagging that pretty little tongue at me like that otherwise I may just have it cut off.
38775,You lookin' for a new blade?
38778,She cannot hide from us forever.
38780,You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.
38781,Come on in. Just stoked the fire. Take a seat and get the cold out.
38782,"Don't move. Don't move. I have it here, somewhere... never thought it would be any use, but now..."
38783,"I've always fancied a journey up the 7,000 Steps to the monastery."
38785,"Panic we can handle, Balgruuf. It's the dragons I'm not so sure about."
38787,Hmph. 
38791,"We don't want your kind here, dark elves!"
38796,I shall not be bound.
38797,I'm sure Arngeir would call it one of my failings.
38799,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
38801,"Now remove yourself from my presence, while you still draw breath."
38802,"Nocturnal doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the Guild."
38804,"If we can gain the confidence of someone very influential who lives there by doing a unique job for them, we'd be able to have some leverage there too."
38808,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
38809,Hmph.
38810,Here. I want you to have this. Don't ask. Just take it.
38811,"Ah, the sweet smell of burnt flesh. Nothing better really."
38814,I ain't begging. I just need a job. Anything.
38816,Yes! Yes! Return me to this realm!
38817,You look strong. Come to Jorrvaskr and be a Companion!
38818,No use thinkin' of things I can't change. Too much work to be done...
38819,We summon Potema!
38820,Amaund Motierre? But that would mean...
38823,You hear that? The others must have found something!
38826,We summon Potema!
38827,We summon Potema!
38830,The road makes this one weary.
38831,"Idiot. I may not have a lot of rules, but that doesn't give you free reign to do as you please. You want to resume your duties? Go talk to Nazir."
38833,We summon Potema!
38834,But his chocolate pate gives me the runs.
38835,We summon Potema!
38837,Are you here to save me?
38839,"If you're headed that way, I would appreciate you delivering a purchase agreement for me. You'd be paid, of course."
38840,I've been hearing rumors of Silver Hand activity.
38842,"It stops at once, or else there will be consequences of an unpleasant nature. Do you understand?"
38844,"Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them."
38846,A group of them has holed up in Winterhold.
38847,Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling?
38849,A group of them has holed up in Haafingar.
38850,"My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own."
38851,I'm sure I know what this is about.
38852,I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times.
38855,I'm glad you're with us. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
38856,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Eastmarch.
38857,Why are you people doing this?
38859,"Today, Whiterun is the jewel of Skyrim. I can say without boast that is the greatest city in all the holds."
38860,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Hjaalmarch.
38862,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Haafingar.
38863,All at once! You're efficient. I like that. Here's your reward.
38864,"Hear my prayer, son of Akatosh, and grant peace to these departed souls."
38866,"Heard about that, did you? Yes, I went out for a pint or two. What of it?"
38869,"No more than that. I don't want to hear about a killing, understand?"
38870,Goodbye.
38871,"I don't know what the fight is about, and that's not our business anyway."
38875,"Ooh, you're a wizard! I mean, you cast that spell just now, yeah? I was hoping you could make me invisible or something. Can you? Make me invisible?"
38876,Are you sure this is the right way?
38877,"I was actually scouting a bit the other day, old times sake. Spied a brigand heading back to his camp."
38879,I figured you had it in you. Nicely done.
38881,You seem to have a knack for this kind of thing. I'll make sure people in charge know.
38883,"When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to."
38884,"Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, sister."
38885,I hear you've been busy of late.
38886,Have you met Torom? He's the best dog in the Reach.
38887,"Oh, you heard about that, huh? Uh, sorry boss. I was going to speak to Delvin about cutting the Guild in, but I forgot."
38890,"An alchemy lab, it could be in here.  It's worth a look."
38893,"Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!"
38894,"Not much further. Come, little thing. Serve me in death."
38895,"I'm not the only one seeing this, am I?"
38896,Igmund was weak. We'll bring the order that the Empire should have.
38898,I hate her. Everyone hates her. She's the meanest person I ever met. Sometimes she even locks us in the... room.
38899,"Oh, goodness me. You're a friend of Gabriella's, then. Well, I guess we both know why you're here."
38901,Are you serious? I hear more threatening words from my wife.
38902,"Yes, I'm sure that's true."
38905,Must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
38907,"Your destiny is dark. Oh yes, so dark. But much of it has been fulfilled. You have found sanctuary, and the comforting words of a mother's love."
38910,"Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest..."
38912,"There's a cave. No, not a cave. A... home? A place you feel secure. You will find safety there... sanctuary. I see snow, lit by the star of dawn."
38917,I knew you'd come eventually.
38918,And any other abominations that prey on mortals. Vampires. Werewolves. Witches.
38919,Amusing.
38920,"What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed."
38921,"Oh, excuse me, milord. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people."
38922,Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet.
38925,"Oh thank you, kind stranger. Thank you for helping Cicero and his poor, stranded mother."
38929,I found out the Thalmor have him. And they don't let anyone go.
38930,"Sorry, sir. It won't happen again."
38931,"What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed."
38933,Have a good rest. It's the big room with the double bed.
38934,Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.
38938,A Forsworn agent. Running loose in the city. The Jarl is going to hear about this.
38939,"Rumor has it the Jarl's Steward, Raerek, is a faithful Talos worshipper, if not a true son of Skyrim - he still supports the Empire, after all."
38942,"Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun."
38944,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
38949,"Either leave Valenwood, or he'd have me thrown into jail. Gave me a day to say my goodbyes to everyone."
38950,This is the Silver-Blood Inn. I'll let you figure out who owns it by yourself.
38951,"We can meet you there, or all travel together, your call."
38952,Biding his time until what? Until another person is lying dead in the streets? Don't be naive.
38953,That's comforting. Glad they're keeping watch instead of getting rid of the draugr.
38957,"Need a horse? I guess I'm the one to talk to, since my da passed..."
38961,Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.
38962,The Forsworn. Here inside the city.
38963,We'll handle things from here. Move along.
38965,Did you bring a torch? These old forts can get pretty dark inside.
38967,"But if you want to get yourself killed, go ahead."
38968,"Amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to continue my research. I have no time for idle chatter with any simpleton who strikes up a conversation."
38977,What was that?
38979,I'll spare you - for now.
38983,"Of course, Lucan. Of course. I was just, well... Never mind."
38986,"Damn it, woman! Ingun is the most promising alchemist I've ever seen and I won't have you scaring her off!"
38990,"I only wish to escape the constant glaring of my ""colleagues"" and discover an opportunity for repose. Your Arcanaeum is so lovely and quiet..."
38992,"If it weren't for Michel, I'd probably be dead in a Markarth gutter by now."
38994,Please... I... I can't talk to you right now...
38995,"Why are you following me? I told you, I don't know anything else!"
38997,What's going on?!
38998,Good work! Let's see what you got.
38999,"And so you fulfilled your destiny, which you once said you did not believe in."
39001,"The truth, child of Talos, is that the Dragon's children have come! To purge the world in fire and righteousness!"
39002,How are your students coming along?
39005,"Indeed, you saw more clearly than I - certainly more clearly than Alduin. Rok funta koraav."
39007,Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said if I'm late one more time he'll kick me right out the door!
39011,"Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child compared to the dullest of the Dwemer. "
39012,You have won a mighty victory. Sahrot krongrah - one that will echo through all the ages of this world for those who have eyes to see.
39013,I am glad you believe that. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
39014,"Then I'm afraid your suspension will stand for now. I'm sorry, but that's the way it has to be."
39016,"When the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Imperial City, the Legion all but turned a blind eye to the other provinces."
39021,This place could be massive... very easy to get lost. We have to be careful not to lose our way.
39024,I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.
39025,"Yes, Listener."
39029,You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.
39030,I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed!
39037,Frodnar... nobody is going to believe that your dog is a... Frostbite Spider. And if they do... they'll kill him. That's not much of a prank.
39038,"Do you ever get tired of long nights at the mill, Zaria?"
39039,Only thing I hate worse than those scale-backs are them filthy gray-skins!
39044,I'll remain in this location until ordered otherwise.
39045,"I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final."
39046,"Thonjolf is convinced I've got some connections at the College, so he goes easy on me."
39047,"So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my projects."
39048,My sister Deeja will be at the wreck with our Blackblood Marauders. She knows to expect you.
39052,"""...and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire."""
39053,"Yes, Listener! I will remain in this very spot until you tell me otherwise. Spiders could eat my face off and faithful Cicero would not move an inch!"
39056,"The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak."
39057,"I'm sorry, sir, I'm on duty."
39058,"My mother, Sharamph, knows many remedies you may wish to take with you."
39060,"You'd better be able to deliver, Dragonborn. I sacrificed a lot here today."
39061,I hope this all gets straightened out soon or I'm headed on the first caravan out of Riften.
39064,"I thought you could help us out. Food, supplies, a place to stay."
39066,"In all my years, I've never seen such a thing..."
39069,"Oh, of course. Mother needs me, after all."
39070,"Well, for the thrill of course."
39073,"I'm a mage, not a pawnbroker, you know."
39074,"Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!"
39079,"It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract."
39082,"The choice was clear. And now, Ulfric threatens the thinly veiled peace we sacrificed so much for."
39085,You should head on inside. Eydis or Skuli can take care of you.
39089,"Perhaps someday I'll continue where he left off, it's the least I can do considering how much he did for me."
39090,"Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us."
39092,Pull him back!
39095,There we are!
39096,I've been invited to dinner.... I'm so hungry....
39098,Citizen. I'm warning you. Your presence is interfering with Imperial business. Be gone!
39099,Nnh!
39101,I need to lay down. I'll just be a minute....
39102,The meal is on Namira's table. Go ahead. Carve.
39103,"You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you."
39106,I look forward to it then.
39107,Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.
39109,"On the other hand, takin' some of these extra jobs off my hands, now that'll get you to the top of my list."
39111,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
39114,"If you have any further questions, can you please hold them until I've finished?"
39117,Drem!
39119,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
39120,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
39121,"She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes."
39122,The Empire will return. Count on it.
39124,Riften and thieves means trouble. Just leave it alone.
39125,Don't even think about it.
39126,You're being paranoid. We're in control of Markarth. Not the Forsworn.
39127,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
39128,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
39131,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
39132,I've got my hands full with something. Don't go far. I'll need you soon.
39133,We should present the verse soon.
39135,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
39137,"Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much."
39138,A parent should never outlive a child. Having my son's spirit here... it's as if he never died.
39140,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
39142,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
39144,"They're... adequate. Honestly, I rely on the business brought in by the Burning of King Olaf, and that's not likely to happen this year."
39146,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
39147,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
39150,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
39151,"Sondas, does Hrefna ever mention Meieran to you?"
39153,Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot? 
39154,"And obviously you have Ulfric, the Jarl and future High King. "
39155,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
39156,Here. Take my amulet as a reward.
39158,"It's my pleasure. If you see the Thieves Guild harassing anyone else, you be sure and let me know."
39161,"You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me!"
39162,I fight... because I must.
39163,Let's see if we can't find an outfit that suits you.
39164,I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The Eye of Magnus as your people have taken to calling it.
39165,"Of course. Nothing gets done without my approval in this city. I have the Jarl's ear, and the guards in my pocket."
39169,"And you, go sit on that damn chair and start acting like a Jarl."
39170,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
39171,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
39172,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
39174,"Don't worry, Hewnon will let you pass."
39177,I used to have five good men who worked the mill with me. Then this war started and they all ran off. Idiots with mead in their blood.
39178,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
39179,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
39180,You have stepped on us long enough!
39181,"You ask me, those brats in the orphanage are better off, now that old Grelod is dead."
39183,"All right, dear."
39185,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
39186,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
39188,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
39189,"I'm not opening this door, so you might as well leave me alone."
39190,These wizards are mad beyond reason. They understand only violence.
39191,"We're there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. My way is better."
39193,"It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine?"
39197,"Dorthe, listen to me. Your father and your friend may treat you like a boy, but you're not. Do you understand? So please. Be a girl. For me."
39200,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
39201,"Through this gate, just beside my quarters, is a tunnel. A tunnel that leads right through the old Dwarven ruins of Markarth, into the city."
39202,"Imedhnain, I was just comparing the ledgers from last season."
39204,What's that?
39205,"You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you, Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age."
39206,Stand back and behold my handiwork.
39207,"Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giordano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down."
39209,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
39210,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
39212,"Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion."
39215,Wait.
39216,Good to hear. Have your share of the pay.
39218,You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
39220,That's a fine potion you've put together.
39223,"I am Lu'ah Al-Skaven. Who are you to disrupt my work? Begone, or I will add you to my army of the dead!"
39224,"However, since it wouldn't behoove me to make you disappear, I'd rather have you on my side as Thane of Riften."
39226,That's a fine potion you've put together.
39228,"Unfair! Unjust! Cicero has done nothing wrong! Loreius will pay for his treachery! Oh, how he will pay... And you! You were no help! Not at all!"
39229,"No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina released what they call ""The Miasma,"" putting everyone to sleep."
39230,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
39232,"Get to it, then."
39233,"Go. Bring honor to yourself, and the Companions."
39238,"Oh, wipe that frown off your face Rogatus. You've been wearing that frown for over 50 years now."
39239,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle all the way in Winterhold.
39240,Alduin mahlaan
39241,Imperial dogs... there's nothing that's too low for them.
39245,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle down in Falkreath.
39246,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle up in Hjaalmarch.
39247,"Ah, my son, you'll be a fine innkeeper someday, like your father."
39248,"Of course, sweetie. What'd you like to know?"
39250,"I ain't afraid of the old hag. Still, I wish Constance was in charge. She treats us real good."
39251,"What do you want from me, now?"
39253,"Dawnstar's got its problems, but as long as the ore is good, I'll stay."
39255,The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred.
39257,If you want the mark that badly then go ahead and take it.
39258,Looks like it's going to be a bountiful harvest once again. The gods continue to smile upon us.
39260,"Maybe you're right. Even so, I can't help wondering if some other force it at work here."
39261,The last wheat shipment fetched a fine price at market.
39262,"Are you referring to your other customers? No, everything is quite all right. I expect a bit of animosity now and then."
39267,"Allow me to introduce myself: Razelan. Imports and exports, by trade. Observer of human nature, by avocation."
39268,"Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever."
39269,"I just wanted to try on your old armor, from back when you were a soldier. I thought I might be old enough to wear it."
39270,"Derkeethus, from Darkwater Crossing. "
39272,Another fine day at work in the fields. I don't envy those city folk who miss out on the joys of working the land.
39273,I'll tell you who I don't envy - those poor children who lost their parents in this war.
39274,"Lives lost, crops burned, land ruined... there's no greater sin than war. And yet, you were an orphan, and you've made something of your life."
39275,"I was lucky. If you hadn't rescued me, I'd probably be a thief, a mercenary or something even worse."
39276,"Yes, I know just what you mean. My toes are numb from the cold more often than not."
39277,It's too fine a day to dwell on such things. Let's get back to work and forget about wars and orphans for awhile.
39280,Hah! Who in their right mind would pay for dirt? You'd get laughed out of Whiterun for even trying it.
39281,"I'm not saying it's my business, but I have to ask. Why are you so cruel to your little girls?"
39282,No? I daresay we don't have all day.
39284,"When things started goin' downhill around here, it became difficult to keep it all together. We lost fences, influential contacts and coin."
39285,Hah! And what would a witless oaf like you know about raising children?
39286,Wanderer like you must have quite an appetite. Some food?
39288,You... Dragonborn? Is it really true?
39290,Don't be so petulant!
39291,"Not now, it's time for the ceremony."
39292,"Oh, it's much better than that. I will teach you how to breathe underwater, with no need to turn into one of those ugly creatures."
39294,I wish I didn't have to. It's quite a difficult climb.
39295,Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.
39297,Hrongar will know my meaning.
39299,He had a way of enthralling people and built up a loyal army of followers. Good men fell under his spell and were forever twisted. Made... evil.
39300,We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.
39302,Our daughter. Our little girl. She hadn't seen her tenth winter.
39304,"War dogs cost gold, friend. Come back when you have some."
39310,Skyrim belongs to the Nords!
39311,"What is it, woman? Sven drunk on the job again?"
39312,Hod. Just come here.
39316,We done?
39318,Helgen? Has something happened...?
39320,But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora.
39323,Praise to Namira!
39324,You might make a decent Companion yet.
39327,"You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this."
39328,Somehow I doubt that will persuade them.
39329,Are you here to help?
39330,"A fine day to you, friend. May you die with a sword in your hands."
39331,Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.
39335,"""...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers and sisters in arms."""
39337,Talos smite you!
39338,"Oh, and here. You're a Stormcloak now, you ought to look the part."
39339,Which means you get to tag along on a little trip with me.
39344,Lazy oaf.
39345,No one bests an Orc!
39346,I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares.
39348,Very well. I suppose I'll just curl up somewhere until this passes as usual.
39352,Have you been learning your ores?
39356,"Because the rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed to slow down the aging process."
39357,Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person.
39359,"In some cases, a few never awoke at all."
39360,Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?
39362,"Good. You're here. I'll place the pieces on the altar, and Dagon should speak to us."
39366,"Don't interfere with Imperial Legion business. Now move along, unless you want three inches of steel in your gut."
39368,Agggh!
39374,"""Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!"""
39376,Quite so.
39378,"Welcome to the Imperial Legion, soldier."
39379,But I don't want to be patient! I want my dress right now! Father promised!
39380,We're not done here.
39382,Say hello to Verulus for me.
39386,Whoa!
39387,"Though shall mourn my brother, I thank you, friend. You've given me my life back."
39389,Give him this gold. Tell him you need Arkay's help exploring an old cavern for treasure.
39390,"A priest, filled with the taste of an easy life. Brother Verulus, from Markarth."
39391,And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
39392,Please. Take your time.
39395,Things seem to be going well at the Guild.
39396,"Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal."
39397,"Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares."
39398,Maybe you'd like a taste?
39399,"Oh, Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? "
39400,You saved my life. I won't forget it. Look me up if you're ever in Riften.
39402,"See those stones peeking through the surface? Used to be an old Imperial fort on the lake. Really! Stories say it up and sunk one day, but who knows?"
39403,"When my daughter Lash chose to leave the stronghold, I forged a sword to channel all my shame and grief."
39404,"Occasionally. But an Orc blade is a very personal thing. Anger, regret, pride. All these things are put into our steel."
39405,Lady Ateia has already arranged for me to perform in the court of the Jarl of Falkreath.
39406,"Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap."
39407,"And they got the orders backwards. Ha ha ha.  Yes, I'm writing that in.  It should be good for a laugh from the court."
39408,"Smart thing you did, buying Honeyside. Nice place, and why pay for an inn?"
39409,"If you're trying to ask if I tend the hall of the dead alone, then the answer is yes."
39410,"The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured."
39414,"If Indaryn finds out, he'll have me thrown out of the Meadery for certain. So don't breathe a word of it to him. Not a word!"
39417,"Don't you have all the information you need? Please, the Emperor isn't going to kill himself. Hmph. Now wouldn't that be a blessing..."
39418,"If you need marksman training, and you've got the coin... I'm ready to teach you."
39419,A group of them has holed up in Whiterun.
39420,"I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!"
39424,"All right, whatever you want."
39426, 
39432,Stop! Enough! Stand down!
39433,Good lass.
39434,"You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?"
39435,No. Not again. Help!
39436,Many have fallen in this crypt. The Draugr show no mercy.
39437,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
39438,Why? What's he doing now?
39442,"At least, that's what I'm told it does... there hasn't been a paragon in this Guild for hundreds of years."
39443,"Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious."
39444,"Well, well. It's raw meat. Oh, my beautiful wife has told me all about you."
39445,He's been in Kynesgrove forever. Great storyteller. Keeps everyone's spirits up.
39447,Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
39448,You'll never get the claw!
39449,"Savor your triumph, Dovahkiin. This is not the last of what you will write upon the currents of Time."
39450,Is that one of the old ruins?
39451,Is it dead?
39452,Is it over?
39453,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
39454,Speak.
39456,Now? I announce to all of Markarth that I have returned. Don't worry about your name. They'll know who to blame and fear after today.
39457,Agh. Agh!
39458,Get it away from me. Get it away!
39459,I learn much from Garakh every day. I must learn if I am to take her place.
39461,Help me out of here!
39462,I'd rather fight bandits than draugr. At least bandits know when to stay dead.
39463,Help me! Help!
39464,"Yes. Vahzah. You speak true, Dovahkiin. Forgive me."
39466,So? So?
39467,Working in the Treasury House isn't so bad. I earn good money.
39469,"Until next time, brother."
39471,It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls.
39474,You need to choose between those two boys. It ain't fair to Sven or Faendal to keep tuggin' on their heart strings like that.
39475,You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.
39479,Did you see that madman? A Forsworn agent. Here in the city.
39483,"Much appreciated, Lady Drifa, but I'll manage."
39484,Funny coming from a woman who's breath smells like she just kissed a draugr.
39487,I wish someone would find me.
39489,"Just stay away from her, or...or else."
39490,It's no fun unless you fight me with magic.
39491,What do you mean?
39494,"Got a personal request from Brynjolf on this numbers job. He says we may hit 'em hard later, and wants to prep their books. Help us out?"
39495,"Oh, Sven. You do know how to turn a girl's head."
39496,"Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip."
39497,I'll have some mead.
39498,"Some wine, please?"
39499,I realize some of you may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end your lives either.
39500,Gimme a mug of ale.
39502,Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.
39504,"Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to."
39508,"I don't know what you did, but Braith won't even look at me now! So thanks!"
39509,"One day, I must fight my brother Nagrub for chiefdom. It will not be easy."
39510,Certainly.
39511,"What? Who are you? Oh, never mind. Cut me down before that thing gets us!"
39512,And lead the Companions to further glory. 
39513,It's no secret that Jarl Idgrod is... different. It's also no secret that there are rumors about her and her visions.
39514,"Ay, we can get that for ya. We just finished the timber for those catapults."
39516,"War may be good for business, but it's hard on families."
39518,J'zargo... what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs.
39520,They grabbed me in the Ratway. The nerve of these bastards... they need to be taught a lesson.
39521,"There's been talk again in the streets. A general fear that the giants may move south, and then... Well, you understand."
39525,I do hope you'll remain in Solitude. This city could do with some new blood.
39527,"Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation."
39528,"And I'm sure he told you it was urgent. Well, he's not the only Jarl in Skyrim with problems to deal with."
39531,"Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation."
39534,You'd better come in and tell me how you found me and what you want.
39536,I've got a top man on the job right now. He should be returning any moment.
39537,Don't mess anything up while you're here...
39539,The mist is gone! A glorious day!
39542,Dragonborn! Have you come to cleanse Sovngarde at long last of Alduin's foul mist?
39543,"Do not fail Kodlak. He's earned his place here, and does not deserve to fall prey to Alduin's insatiable hunger."
39544,"Banners, huh? Trying to pretty up the place? All right, you got it."
39549,Easily blocked!
39550,"Aye, that sounds like him. "
39551,Damn. That's quite a sight.
39553,Anything I can help you with? A drink or a room perhaps?
39558,"In his quarters, with that Thalmor, Ancano. Something urgent, it sounded like."
39562,Boss was looking for you - said he'd be up at the summit. Better not keep him waiting.
39565,"Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors."
39566,"In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly. I might rather consider Whiterun."
39568,You're outmatched!
39569,"Mallory is an expert ""obtainer of goods."" We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, hmm?"
39571,"Now, might I offer some advice? You should go to Riften and find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before?"
39573,"You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council?  Let's see!"
39574,"What we do here today, we do for our country! For all the true Nords of Skyrim!"
39576,There's another door. See if you can get it open.
39577,This city is corrupt. Rotten to the core. No one cares about anything except themselves and how much coin they can make off the misery of others.
39580,"Are you feeling all right, dear? You look a little ill."
39581,Horik and I have lived here ever since I retired. He's a good soldier.
39583,That Heimskr's crazy. Him and his talk o' Talos. Wish he'd just shut up.
39584,Any news of the Alik'r?
39585,You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness.
39587,Drem...Ov!
39589,"We've discovered that some of the dead have been... eaten. Flesh has been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside."
39590,"I... I apologize, master."
39593,Anyone makes trouble for me and I pay a visit to the Thieves Guild. Make me angry and I contact the Dark Brotherhood.
39597,"The contracts I dole out are fairly simple - go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different."
39598,The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit.
39600,Anyone with a stout heart like yours is welcome here.
39601,And you think that I care? Interesting.
39602,Fine then.  The blood of my family is on your hands as well as Brurid's.
39605,Your objective is Fort Sungard.
39606,This heap of matchsticks is what everyone calls Haelga's Bunkhouse. Can you stay here? No.
39607,Thank Malacath we got out of Kolskeggr alive.
39609,What's wrong? You have to look at the blood closely to see the quality of the meat. How else will you know it's fresh?
39612,"Why, why have you done this to us?"
39614,"So, you've come to see me to sell or to buy? Hm?"
39618,"Well, I'd better get back to work. You two make yourselves at home."
39621,"But before I fought, I had to train."
39622,"You'd better hope there's still a chance for you to prove yourself, though, or this Trial might last longer than you'd like."
39623,Just let me out of here. I only wanted to help you!
39624,Good to see Skyrim still has such fine people. You give an old man hope.
39627,"Thank you for bringing this to me. I'll make sure he gets his rites. Here, for your trouble."
39629,"Cleared out, I guess."
39631,All that remains then is the exterior gate. Find a way through to open it and the city will be ours!
39632,"The faster we take them out, the faster we can claim this city as ours!"
39633,Let's be done with it!
39636,They were a secret cabal of the three top rogues in the Thieves Guild. No one knew their identities.
39637,We now fight our way to Castle Dour to cut the head off the legion itself!
39638,"The only way into Windhelm is across this bridge. Keep moving, stay close, and we'll be through their gates in no time."
39640,"The approach to Riften is guarded by watchtowers. They will be full of archers. Move fast, and stay low."
39643,"Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the sons and daughters of Skyrim!"
39646,Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
39654,Just here to drink.
39655,Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
39656,Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperials what we're made of!
39658,My favorite drinking buddy! Let's get some mead.
39659,Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
39660,How are we doing over here?
39661,Alduin escaped us long ago. Today we take our well-tempered revenge.
39663,We must be near the entrance for that bear to have made its den here.
39665,"I'll look for you, friend, when at last you return to Shor's hall. The honor will be ours when you rejoin the ranks of Sovngarde."
39667,"You may strike me down, but your doom is near."
39668,"I may fall to your malice, but your fate is already written."
39669,Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.
39670,"Aye, you've got a point there."
39671,"Your guy's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens and paying us good coin for nobody to know about it. Well, until now that is."
39672,Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.
39673,The Stormcloaks are here in force. Stick close and follow orders so we don't stir up the whole place against us.
39675,Wouldn't it be something if we found a vein of gold?
39676,"If you know an enchantment and have a filled soul gem, you can enchant armor and weapons. Just use the arcane enchanter."
39677,"I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could use it?"
39679,"I hope so. The Legion is Skyrim's only hope right now. Come on, we'd better get moving."
39680,"Have you seen the man? He's completely out of his head. A jester? Here, in Skyrim? Ain't been a merryman in these parts for a hundred years."
39681,Authorities? Have you been listening to what I said? They're all dirty. Every one of them.
39682,"Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will crush you."
39683,"I'd explain my research, but you'd just be confused."
39684,Only Dagon can declare if a pawn is worth keeping. I. Have. Spoken.
39686,"I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to wreak havoc on Tamriel."
39687,"They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of Destruction and Change."
39688,"Seen a lot of travelers lately. Mostly soldier, nowadays."
39693,Yes. There were a few of us that rebelled against Alduin's thur... his tyranny. We aided the humans in his overthrow.
39694,"Wujeeta, you can't keep showing up here late. Bolli's just going to get someone to replace you."
39695,Is he dead?
39696,"Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!"
39697,"Everyone please, stand back!"
39698,"Won't lie, I am. And you?"
39700,"No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything."
39701,Soon you will know the cold of death...
39702,"Gods, I'll be glad to see the last of Skyrim."
39704,I think we'll all feel better once we're back out to sea. Won't be long now.
39708,Yeah. I'm glad we can finally stand down- getting tired of looking over my shoulder all the time.
39709,Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts.
39712,You are not worthy.
39714,Why won't you die!
39715,"What do you aim to do with that hammer, friend? Knock down a house?"
39716,I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way.
39717,"The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife."
39719,"Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day."
39720,"If you ever feel the need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and step onto a different circle."
39721,This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance.
39723,Then come back when you've got that much.
39726,"Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it."
39727,"Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga."
39728,"Here, I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest."
39729,Father says I shouldn't play with you anymore.
39732,Is that a joke?
39735,"I only hope that this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning."
39737,"Well, hey there. What can Sapphire do for you?"
39740,*cough*
39742,"One of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever."
39743,Sure. Then you wake up in the morning with your purse empty and your gear stolen. No thanks.
39746,Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked.
39747,"Why should I bother? I've already made a bunch of coin off of his shipment, so anything else I squeeze out of him would be a bonus. "
39749,"Don't know what you're talking about, stranger."
39750,Then I must do this alone.
39752,And here's your payment for the shards.
39753,My family has been doing it for years. You need one out in the Reach. Don't want to be alone when some Forsworn comes swinging.
39754,"He he. Not just yet, Dorthe. I need to keep forging, and you need to keep watching."
39756,"Finally, we have an agreement."
39757,Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the Daedra. Look at how it shines.
39759,"You can prove your new allegiance to me, by delivering an important message to the Jarl of Whiterun."
39761,Here's your gold.
39762,"Oh, thank you! I've been working on an original piece. I hope it can stand up to the classics!"
39764,"I see. If something does happen, you know where I am."
39765,My agents are telling me that we've appropriated the caravan from Hammerfell... with minimal losses.
39768,Been a long time since someone took the leap. Longer still since any survived it.
39769,"Cicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!"
39771,Fire is not a toy.
39772,"We just need the pommel and the shards of the blade, now."
39773,He lives somewhere in the Ratway Warrens. Must be crazy or desperate to live down there. Maybe both.
39776,I know how to put all the pieces together. We just need to take them to Dagon's shrine and contact the Lord of Change directly.
39777,No. I don't have any idea. I was just shopping for a pendant for my sister back in the Imperial City.
39779,"Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds."
39780,I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.
39781,And here you are. I hope you've found the museum to your liking.
39784,Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?
39786,"But our work is just beginning. Approach me, Listener, and hear my words."
39787,Here's for your trouble.
39788,"What are you doing here, outlander? We don't deal with your kind."
39797,"Speak with the Dishonored Skald at the Bards College, in Solitude. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
39798,"And when the coin dried up, that's when people started to leave."
39799,"Speak with the Wary Outlaw at the Bee and Barb, in Riften. Accept his gold, and then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
39800,"This isn't the time or place for magic, or whatever it is Falion does."
39801,At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal - just speak the word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm wherever he lurks.
39803,I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a home to keep and children to feed. Now let me out of here!
39804,Feel free to look around. Come talk to me when you're ready to discuss that job I mentioned.
39807,"Before I came into Zenithar's calling, I confess I was a thief. But I learned a few things in my time that might help you survive. Let me show you."
39808,Each bolt of yarn used to make the robe was colored with a dye made from sacrificial blood.
39809,"Those robes were worn during the Mythic Dawn's secret meetings, where they plotted to bring the Daedra Mehrunes Dagon into Tamriel."
39813,"Come, let's go find Farengar, my court wizard. He's been looking into a matter related to these dragons and... rumors of dragons."
39814,No.... Not again!
39815,It's said that Mankar Camoran used the book to open a portal to a Paradise where all his followers would live forever.
39816,That burned paper is all that remains of the fabled Mysterium Xarxes. The blasphemous book written by Mehrunes Dagon himself.
39818,"Hey, who's there?"
39819,"Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them."
39820,I'm sorry to be such a bother. We'll talk another time.
39821,Show me.
39822,Look here! You see how the ancient Blades revered Reman Cyrodiil.
39823,So I'll cut right to the chase.
39824,"You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices."
39825,I've got a good feeling about you. And I don't often get good feelings about anything. A warrior knows to trust her gut...
39826,"Oh, so you're the one in charge now? Fine, fine."
39827,"Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own... don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise."
39829,"You fight well, brother. "
39830,The people of Skyrim are more open minded about certain things than people in other places.
39831,"Eat up, Svari."
39832,"A pick breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky clearing at the wrong moment..."
39834,Lure it into the trap! I'm counting on you!
39835,"Look, I got the message. What else did you want?"
39836,"Go on in, already."
39837,Think about the Guild... about the state it was in when you began. Think about all the little things you might have heard.
39838,What now? 
39842,His request is denied... I'm not paying him any more gold. This madness has to end.
39843,For the sons of Skyrim!
39844,You've arrived at last. The heroine who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
39846,This is last time we speak of this.
39847,You've arrived at last. The hero who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
39848,"Logrolf rescued me and gave me enough money to get out of the city. I followed the Karth river north, and came here."
39851,"It has been a profitable journey, and yet I long for the warm sands of Elsweyr more and more each day. "
39853,"The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity."
39856,"We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for what's happened here."
39858,I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship.
39859,"The College survived, and so here we remain."
39860,"My Lady, I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure."
39863,I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.
39864,I haven't heard that name in a long time.
39865,Try not to disappoint. Or to get him killed.
39866,An Elder Scroll? That's not going to be easy to come by.
39867,Leave me alone.
39868,"Anything, as long as I get to fight."
39870,"What are you staring at, you worthless piece of gutter trash? I simply must start locking the doors again..."
39871,"If you want to die, so be it."
39872,"Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible."
39877,The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within these walls is the Ebonmere... a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam.
39879,Whatever damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.
39880,"I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll."
39882,"We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem."
39883,"With the Ebonmere closed, and their sudden severance from the realm of Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change."
39886,"However, ever since that day, I've felt my power waning... slowly draining away."
39887,I've just never heard of a midwife losing all her mothers like that.
39892,"Let's see... this one, I think. J'zargo has designed it to be an excellent flame cloak, with a twist."
39893,"Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!"
39896,You've returned. What happened in the Hall of the Dead?
39897,This way.
39903,Damn outsiders.
39906,"Once the Emperor is convinced of the need, then you will see the full strength of the Imperial Legion."
39910, 
39911,"It drove him mad. Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished."
39912,It's not a simple matter. I could offend her fairly easily by bringing up the wrong subject. I've seen it happen before.
39913, 
39915, 
39916,The way this war is going there might not be anyone left to drink soon.
39918, 
39919,"Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do."
39920, 
39921,Now go. And give my best to the bride.
39922,Ven Mul Riik!
39923, 
39925,Tell everyone you see to bring me some septims.
39926,There he is! Get him!
39927,"Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So there's that."
39928,Why are you always acting like such a big baby? I've gotten us this far.
39929,"This may sound obvious, but do you see a lever anywhere?"
39930,"You worry about bashing people's heads in, I'll worry about the Guild. Okay?"
39931,"Okay, okay."
39933,I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations with your College.
39935,They say he Shouted it into submission in single combat atop Mount Anthor and brought it back to Whiterun.
39939,Why? There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms against his rightful Emperor.
39940,"If it's horses you want, I'm not sure I can help you. I have too much on my mind as it is."
39942,I don't know what to say. I didn't think anyone in Riften even cared what happened to me.
39943,"I work at the mill. Chop trees, carry logs, saw lumber, you know."
39944,"You wouldn't attack an old man again, would you?"
39952,Sorry to have bothered you. I'll just be out of your way now.
39955,"It is difficult to admit, but J'zargo could still use some help."
39956,"J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. Can you help with this?"
39957,"You must be very skilled with magic, yes?"
39964,Will do. Don't stray too far away or else we'll come after you.
39965,"Greetings, Shield-Sister."
39966,No. I will have no peace until these hunters are dead.
39970,Careful there!
39971,"But last I heard, Nilsine is still alive. So I guess you decided not to kill her as well. I have to admit... I'm disappointed."
39972,"But more will come. Bring him down, for the glories of Lord Hircine."
39973,Aren't they? I always set some aside for myself when the traders bring them up from the south.
39974,"Is your armor made of... dragon bones? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that."
39975,For honor!
39976,I'll never have Master Nurelion's skill with potions.
39977,But I'm thirsty now.
39978,"If you're looking for any archery or fletching supplies, you should see Fihada. I'm just the apprentice."
39981,You're always thirsty. Just like you're always drunk. Now let me get back to my rounds.
39983,Not this again.
39985,"If he does, tell him how bad the food is. And how dangerous it is."
39988,"Look old woman. If your boy wants to learn how to fight, we'll teach him. Now off with you."
39989,"It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of."
39990,"I have need of a warrior. Only the most ruthless, cunning, and agile will do."
39992,"Spare me your pitiful pride. You are but a tool of my ambitions, mortal. Never forget that."
39993,Ahhhhhhhh!
39997,"I misplaced it in the catacombs. I'd look for it, but I've been hearing noises down there. I fear the dead have become... restless."
40002,My Amulet of Arkay. It's the source of my divine powers and also a sacred badge of office.
40003,"Ah, my thanks. Malacath watch over ya."
40007,We... don't have enough to...
40008,Steel your nerves. The draugr are gone. Focus on your mining.
40011,You better know what you're doing!
40012,"Ah, that reminds me. Speaking of alchemists, I have some frost salts for Arcadia. She asked me to obtain them for one of her potions."
40013,"I believe I am, yes. Technically speaking, of course. The city is also home to a priest, priestess, an alchemist, and I'm sure others who practice."
40016,The Blades were born of dragon-hating crusaders. They still carry that legacy although they may not remember from whence it came.
40017,"Onmund made a deal. He made that choice, and now he has to live with it."
40019,"Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other."
40021,"Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other. Maybe I'll test it on Farengar first..."
40022,"I can't help you, friend. Talk to Hadring, the Innkeeper."
40023,I'll pay you to hurt someone else. Okay?
40024,"By the gods, you're serious. You'd better report this to Commander Maro right away. He's at the Penitus Oculatus outpost, up in Dragon Bridge."
40025,"Well, it was. Sadly, this forge is dying and I've used the last of my fire salts. If I can't feed it soon, it may grow cold."
40026,I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion.
40027,"That wasn't so hard, now was it."
40029,"My agents have recently acquired the passphrase to their Sanctuary. It is, ""Silence, my brother."" Every assassin in that hole must be put down!"
40030,Ha! This is a stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the Dark Brotherhood's movements... waiting for the time to strike. That time is now!
40031,The leader of the Dark Brotherhood? You mean Astrid? Dead? And this is no jest?
40032,"This is a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised - a most generous reward!"
40034,By all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it?
40036,Good. I can use the practice.
40037,What?
40038,I'm afraid we're well beyond pleasantries.
40039,Hroggar's house fire? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
40040,"The museum is opening, Madena."
40043,"Yes, Dean. Thank you."
40045,I can't think of anyone better.
40046,"30th of Frostfall, 171. Thirty years ago. The Great War started that day."
40048,"Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like most of my kind you'll find in Skyrim, that's for damned sure."
40049,You want something?
40050,We have to catch up to him before it's too late.
40051,Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing.
40053,Hssssssss!
40056,Ever been to Markarth? Some say it was built by the dwarves. I don't believe a word of it though.
40057,And what makes you think that?
40062,"Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess."
40064,"The Night Mother's crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation."
40065,Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.
40066,"One block lifts the other. Septimus will give what you want, but you must bring him something in return."
40067,Enough of this mindless banter!
40068,I'll tell you what we do. We spit in that curse's face and turn things around down here. Put things back the way they were.
40070,"We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lass. We're right behind you."
40072,"If you see any signs of Talos worship, it's your obligation to report them to me."
40074,You a fighting man? How about a little bet?
40075,Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.
40076,"Aye. Whatever you want to do, we're with you."
40078,Why would I do that? There's work to be done here.
40079,"My choice, hmm? All right, then - tomatoes. Simple, yet infinitely flavorful. Don't you agree?"
40080,"As it turns out, it was just one. Haldyn. I've since learned more about him."
40081,"Ful, losei Dovahkiin? Zu'u koraav nid nol dov do hi."
40082,"My travels have taken me from High Rock to Valenwood, Elsweyr to Morrowind and all points in between."
40083,Uh huh.
40085,Azura curse you!
40088,"Seven septims are missing from my purse. I know it was Runa. You get those coins back, or by Stendarr, I'll see her rot in the dungeon. "
40089,I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a lake.
40091,Impressive. Damn impressive.
40093,Stay away from my family if you value your life.
40094,You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.
40095,"How are you feeling, Jarl Idgrod?"
40096,I think it's sweet Lu'ah is so worked up over her dead soldier...
40097,"Aaaahhhhhrrrr.... the pain, somebody, stop... the pain..."
40100,I'll point you to the first and last person you're ever going to need to talk to. Tonilia. She's the Guild's fence.
40101,"Okay, okay. Come inside, then. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell me all about it."
40102,"In the middle of it all, the College was practically untouched. Many of the survivors were suspicious."
40107,"Why specifically stars? Wait, you aren't referring to... No, there's no way you would know about that."
40108,"They're simply scholars, they mean no one harm. I've had... several conversations with Arch-Mage Aren over the years."
40111,That's strange...
40112,Nothing yet.
40113,I'm sure I heard something...
40114,"Uh, yes. Quite."
40115,Maybe they're gone?
40116,You should run while you have the chance.
40117,Got to be here somewhere...
40118,"Convince Loreius to fix my wheel! Do that, and poor Cicero will reward you. With coin! Gleamy, shiny coin!"
40119,"Aw, quit your bellyaching."
40120,Brandishing your weapon is not going to help you negotiate a better sale...
40121,"Hold on, what was that?"
40123,Hmm?
40124,Who's there?
40126,You'll let me go. I know you will. This is all just part of the game we play...
40127,I must be getting jumpy.
40128,"Hmm, nothing there after all."
40129,I thought it high time I caught up with you.
40130,Must be my mind playing tricks on me.
40131,You can tell Sven that he already has a mother. I'm not speaking to him anymore.
40132,I vowed to have your head.
40133,"Do you know why Alain was in Windhelm? He heard about Friga's murder. He wanted to befriend the family, in their grief... and rob them blind."
40134,You think running will save you?
40139,"I'm sure you can figure it out on your own. If you can't, perhaps Urag has a book you can read."
40140,"I knew he wasn't gone, I just knew it!"
40141,"An ancient city, Markarth. Build by the Dwemer, the dwarves of old. To think, an entire race... eradicated. Not even I can take credit for that feat."
40142,Ye gods! You think Alva is a vampire?
40143,Where'd you go?
40144,"Well, it's a winding road up the mountain just ahead. You'll know you're in the right place once you spot the old watchtower."
40146,Hmm. Gone. I don't like it.
40147,Stay alert. They may not have gone far.
40149,I think they're gone.
40151,"Hey, if you find a book called ""Night Falls on Sentinel,"" could you bring it to me? It's a story from my wife's people. Be good to have."
40152,Over here!
40153,"Think hard about your loyalties, sister. I expected better from you."
40155,You should have run away.
40157,Got a feeling there's trouble ahead.
40158,"How can I assist, hmm?"
40161,I could use some help over here!
40162,Damn you.
40164,I'm too old for this.
40165,Not bad... but it won't save you.
40166,You'll have to do better than that.
40168,"Pinemoon Cave is down to the southwest, but it ain't fit for exploring. There are stories... Vampires, some say..."
40169,Your length is cut!
40170,"You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor."
40171,No. As if trade wasn't poor enough. Now there's violence in the streets.
40172,"They don't seem to be very sympathetic to our cause, sir."
40173,Uncle Ralof! Can I see your axe? How many Imperials have you killed? Do you really know Ulfric Stormcloak?
40174,"Oh, he'll rot in prison for this one I promise you. As soon as Maven finds out, it's all over for him."
40175,"If you want to fight your way out of here, you have to do it in the Pit."
40177,Don't try to haggle with me. Buy or leave.
40178,"Ah good, back for some more Black-Briar mead, eh?"
40179,"If he gets his hands on them, you can be certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life."
40180,...but only during... the day?
40182, 
40183, 
40184, 
40186,"It's part of the Temple of Kynareth. People want Danica to do something about it, but I don't know what they expect."
40187,Balgruuf won't give us a straight answer.
40190,Oh dear. What should I do?
40191,"Thank you. Please, take these few coins, for services rendered."
40192,Keep your eyes open for traps. Old ruins like this are usually filled with them.
40193,Then put the thumbscrews on him and hit him... hard.
40194,"Ah, this must be that weapon for the Jarl. Poor girl, so eager to prove herself. I'll present it to Balgruuf when his mood is... agreeable."
40195,"Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature."
40196,From Adrianne? 
40197,"Sure. A client's relative lost this item in a gambling match and they're paying us to get it back. So much for fair play, huh?"
40199,"But Shor restrained our wrathful onslaught - perhaps, deep-counselled, your doom he foresaw."
40200,A fateful errand.  No few have chafed to face the Worm since first he set his soul-snare here at Sovngarde's threshold.
40202,By what right do you request entry?
40203,"Apples, tomatoes, leeks and cabbages! Fresh and ripe!"
40204,"There is no news, I'm afraid."
40208,"No shade are you, as usually here passes, but living, you dare the land of the dead."
40211,"Petra, you traitorous grouse! Die!"
40213,"Fools! You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!"
40215,"The folk of the Empire have always had a more cosmopolitan view of the world, so I'm glad to see them in charge."
40216,"Thank you. Here, let an old alchemist pass on some of her secrets to you."
40217,"Certainly, I'm ready."
40219,"Yes, markedly so. Ulfric and his Stormcloaks made no secret of their disdain for the Dark Elves."
40220,"I used to be an adventurer in my day, then I settled down. Got married."
40221,Ah! No more! Don't hurt me again.
40222,"I'm joking, of course, but I'm a lot happier seeing the Empire running things in Windhelm."
40226,Did you know it was his decree that forbade the Argonians from living inside the city walls?
40228,You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my uncle will be glad to help you out.
40229,My father owned it until he... passed on.
40231,"Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here."
40232,"Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement."
40233,"It is absolutely worthy of research, despite many of the notes I've had left in my bed. And my desk. And on occasion, my meals."
40237,Noooo...
40238,"In some ways, yes, but there is often opportunity in chaos."
40240,The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.
40244,I was ready to pack my things when Hermir came to me. She wanted to make sure I'd finish teaching her the smithing trade.
40245,I almost didn't. I wasn't sure I could stomach having some Imperial tell me how to live my life.
40246,"I guess what I'm sayin' is, Ulfric stood up for us, an' for all Skyrim. So who's goin' to stand up for us now?"
40247,"They outlawed the worship of Talos, Skyrim's most beloved son. There's thanks for you."
40248,We need to find a way out of here.
40250,"Oblivion take the Thalmor! I'll never give up Talos, not even if it means my life. Let them come and make me a martyr!"
40253,"I don't care what the Imperials say -- when Ulfric Stormcloak died, one of Skyrim's greatest heroes was lost."
40255,"Unfortunately, a sword can't repair damaged buildings, feed hungry people or undo years of prejudice."
40256,"I just wish things were simpler. In my days as a soldier, I knew who the enemy was, and how to defeat him."
40257,"Corruption, lies and deceit are the order of the day here."
40258,"Every day is a struggle, but a Nord doesn't back down from a fight when the cause is honorable."
40259,"Thalmor filth, eh? Giving all Khajiit a bad name."
40260,"Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very early age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered... by anyone."
40262,"Until those people learn to accept the Argonians, they must remain outside, for their own safety. "
40263,"Most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted."
40264,"I'd like to, but it's not as simple as that."
40266,"Your people's war, I mean. The Nords. What kind of life would we be giving our little one if we stayed here?"
40267,"But I swore an oath to our Dunmer friends that, for as long as I sit on the throne of Windhelm, their needs will not be ignored."
40268,First we'll need to refill our coffers and stockpile stone and wood. The war took a heavy toll on Windhelm's resources.
40270,"I met with several of the Dark Elves to discuss improvements in the Gray Quarter, but we have no real plans as of yet. "
40271,Nice work with this one. You make us all proud.
40274,Of course I am. What brings you here?
40278,"I used to work at the Black-Briar Meadery, but Indaryn and I never saw eye-to-eye. That elf has no patience at all."
40279,What about them? They seem loyal enough.
40280,It's not working. Why don't you give it a try? Just put your hands on the altar.
40283,Always another big meal to cook. Figures.
40284,What's happening to this city?
40286,"If you're not afraid of little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those salts."
40289,Die dog!
40290,"Secondly, I need to cripple rebel production capabilities with a little sabotage."
40295,My joy knows no bounds. Here. A little payment for your troubles.
40296,Here's your cut.
40297,That's the first bit of good news I've had since I set sail a year ago.
40301,That's the spirit.
40303,"I'm not exactly... comfortable around guards or jails. Definitely not when associates of mine have been locked up. No, I'll meet you outside of town."
40304,Put that thing away. You're making people nervous.
40305,You're naked!
40306,Fine work. Here's your pay. Don't spend it all on mead.
40307,"Old lady Frida is a grouch, but she sure can whip up a cure for the Rattles fast."
40308,Here. Take my amulet as a reward.
40309,"Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel better, shortly."
40312,"That's just you getting skinnier every day, old man. You're losing your padding. You need to eat more."
40313,"I was in charge now. I pushed them on, insisting it would be worse to try and go back."
40315,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
40319,"It brings me joy to hear that, but what possessed you to say that so suddenly?"
40320,"Winterhold has lost much of its history, and with that much of its power. I aim to change that."
40322,"Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you."
40325,Good. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for your return.
40327,Then I have no work for you.
40329,You know... you ain't so bad. Here. Take this...
40330,"Here, your reward as promised. You have Winterhold's thanks."
40331,"Good to see you again, friend! We've opened the mine back up. If you're here for work, I'll buy any ore you have."
40332,Gods I'm so tired.
40333,"Men are all alike, from Skyrim to Hammerfell. They care only for war and politics, and treat their women like cattle."
40334,I ask only for a little charity.
40338,Fool. I should thank you. I knew the girl wouldn't be strong enough to help me kill Gathrik alone.
40341,I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.
40342,Good luck to you.
40346,"I'm busy right now, Colette."
40347,"My mother sees things. She doesn't know why, but she does. Only sometimes, she doesn't see me at all."
40348,"If I needed something from you, you would know it."
40350,So now I'm stuck living here while those pigs she calls customers grope me and say the most awful things.
40354,"Look, either you get the notes or I'll figure out another way to do it. Just come find me if you can get your hands on them."
40355,"Wander no more, for you are among friends here, and safe."
40356,"Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?"
40357,You.... You'll pay for this....
40368,Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.
40370,"Skyrim was once the land of many butterflies. Now, not so much."
40371,What is the meaning of this?
40372,Very well.
40373,The good people of Morthal have yet to embrace my talent.
40374,"As you were, then."
40376,Mining's an honest trade. No real tricks to it.
40377,"Fine, then."
40380,Maybe a little influence from your old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...
40381,"I am, thank you. I do so enjoy singing at weddings. It's just one of the many duties we at the Bards College are called upon to perform. "
40382,"I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture."
40383,I... see. And is this something I'll need to worry about in the future?
40386,The Jarl has finally agreed to send you back to Riverwood.
40387,"It's magnificent, isn't it?"
40390,Thanks! I'm out!
40392,That's a touching story. Now get outta my face.
40395,Maybe it would. If you had it.
40397,You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.
40398,Big talk for someone with a light purse.
40401,We did it!
40402,Let's get to the stables before they find me.
40403,Easy there. I don't want that kind of trouble. Guy ain't worth it.
40406,Come now! You're joking with old Nazir! Surely the Emperor's life was worth more than that.
40410,You're nothing!
40411,"He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood."
40412,"I had a medal. It had someone's face on it. I threw it away, after. It didn't help."
40413,I finally understand what it all means. What it was all for. The killing. And the dying.
40414,He'll tell you. Just ask. You don't even need to ask. He'll tell you anyway.
40416,Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.
40418,"Now, what do you all say?"
40422,I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.
40423,"Hello, my dear. I got your message. Where shall we go?"
40424,I heard Vittoria Vici is the Emperor's cousin. I wish he came to the wedding. I never saw a real live Emperor before.
40425,It's not the most exciting answer but the most likely. I'll write it in.
40426,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
40427,Glory to the Forsworn!
40428,"Mind yourself in my city, friend. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight..."
40429,I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right direction once you get there.
40432,"I am. I'd be glad to stand by your side until the Divines take us, if you'll have me."
40433,"If there's anything you need, I'd be glad to help you."
40435,Hmm. Caves. Wonder what's below.
40436,"I have a present for you. A nice, shiny present."
40437,"When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? Don't ask."
40443,Come over here. Please pretty please?
40451,"I'm going to eat well tonight, my darling!"
40452,Rise from your graves to defeat this worm!
40456,You will not stop me from killing those who wage this pointless war!
40460,"Now we can rest in peace once again. Come Fjori, my love..."
40461,"You're that one lives in Breezehome, right? Fine place. Almost bought it myself."
40462,Let me see that journal...
40466,"Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?"
40467,"I never expected... well, suddenly here you are and now I'm too muddled to explain myself."
40469, 
40470,Yeargh!
40471,Help will arrive soon.
40474,You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead...
40477,Astonishing. To think you actually were able to reach it and yet return to tell the tale.
40481,"Let's not jump to conclusions, soldier. The Legion always finds a way."
40482,"If you're inquiring whether we have concerns about her age and inexperience, well, let me put it this way..."
40483,You're a guest. And father says we have to be polite to guests.
40486,"We'll see about that, won't we?"
40487,"Well that all depends on you, now. Doesn't it?"
40488,"He's the real head of this family. He may not be the eldest, but all the work that keeps us respected is handled by my Thonar."
40489,"How about ""The Lusty Argonian Maid""?"
40490,The lute they stole is Finn's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.
40491,"Hey. In the Bannered Mare, there's this bottle of Argonian Ale. The good stuff. Get it for me. They won't even know it's gone. Come on..."
40492,But damn if I ain't almost sober.
40493,You're back. Good. You'll want to hear this.
40494,Get out. Leave me alone!
40495,"Folks at court won't admit it, but Sybille Stentor scares us all to death.  "
40501,Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself.
40505,You don't put up with a man like that. He puts up with you.
40506,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
40507,"Tell me when you are ready, mortal."
40509,"No, only one option remains. I will send you inside the Star. You will banish Malyn's soul there."
40510,"He came nosing around Riften a while back, making a lot of noise about me. He was... persuaded to leave before he found me."
40511,I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?
40514,And who are you to challenge me? I have conquered mortality itself. I've spat in the eyes of the Daedric Lords.
40515,"Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went insane."
40516, 
40517,Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he could store his own soul inside. Become immortal.
40518,"As was destined, you are free to use my Star as you see fit."
40520,There isn't an inch of this building that I haven't cleaned up.
40521,"My Star has been restored and Malyn's soul has been consigned to Oblivion. You have done well, mortal."
40523,"Farewell, mortal. Know that Azura will be guarding over the threads of your fate in the Twilight."
40525,Nuh!
40526,"Job's done, boss. Gave the package to her just you said."
40528,"Oh no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not being blamed for saying something out of place. Again."
40529,"Yours was not an easy transformation. But you're still alive, so congratulations."
40530,I just... I just know it. I can feel it in my heart. You have to believe me.
40531,Right now I've got a book that I think you might like.
40532,"The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right."
40533,In a manner of speaking.
40534,"First off, let's keep this between us. I picked these up from the graves in town so don't go blabbing about it to Kust."
40535,What's she digging around in there for?
40537,"Me, I have been part of the Dark Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am a Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow."
40538,The Mythic Dawn worshipped Dagon as a god. Having his Razor would be invaluable to my collection.
40540,While Drevis appreciates the spellcasting skill that went into somehow cramming several hundred apples into his pillow...
40541,"I mean, it don't cost me anything to let you have one and the dead won't notice their stuff missing. heh."
40543,"I need some more ale, Orgnar."
40544,So close. Your prize is waiting.
40546,You brought this on yourself!
40548,"I love you. You know that, right?"
40549,Great.  Here you go. Come back later and I'll have other things.
40552,"If there's anything you need, just let me know."
40554,Do not be afraid. Your Shout will not harm us.
40555,"The eyes of Shor are upon you this day. Defeat Alduin, and destroy his soul-snare."
40557,Kjeld speaks for Kynesgrove. Anyone who says otherwise is aching for a fight.
40559,Good. Chat time's over.
40560,"Yes, I have something special for you. "
40561,"This'll clear up soon, I'm sure of it."
40565,They are the governing council of the Aldmeri Dominion. They lead us to attack the Empire and forced the Empire to agree to stop worshiping Talos. 
40566,You have helped rid the Orcs of Yamarz in a way that avoids the destruction of their tribe.
40568,"Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to make this contract heard!"
40571,Thank you. May Arkay bless you. I won't forget this.
40573,I knew he was troubled but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
40574,I've got a bad feeling about this.
40576,"Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search."
40580,That may be so. This is Vilkas. He will test your arm.
40587,"I will find you, Fjola!"
40588,And begin.
40589,Again!
40591,We didn't pay much attention to it when I was a boy - everyone still had their little shrine to Talos.
40592,"Well, before that cave-in sealed our ships in here we could loot any size ship we wanted."
40593,How thoughtful! I'll come take a look after supper. 
40595,"Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry."
40597,"Yes, Listener. I'll be here if you need me."
40598,Lead me into battle.
40601,You only use the little swords.
40603,But whales eat razorfish.
40605,Thank you.
40606,Tiny blades don't hurt enough. A sword needs weight.
40607,"Now, I believe you have some business to conclude with my court wizard?"
40609,All I need is one to cut you in half.
40610,"Of course, my lord."
40611,You understand? They left me for dead. I didn't leave them.
40614,"Well, when you put it that way..."
40616,What do you want?
40618,Are you loyal to Skyrim? Break into Lod's house and get that letter.
40619,"There's no shipments coming in, so I do nothing. Just drink."
40621,Easy for you to say. You get to fight.
40622,Of course working for Bolfrida isn't my first choice. But what else can a Dunmer do out here?
40624,This is it men!
40625,"Relax, new blood. "
40627,Fighting people is different. Smarter. 
40628,Few enough reasons to pass through Morthal before the war started.
40630, 
40631,"Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle."
40632,"You forget yourself, young one."
40633,No there isn't. And I suggest you leave it at that. I don't want to see anyone get hurt over this.
40634,Outlaws and brigands are the lowest of the low. They prey on their own countrymen for profit.
40637,That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.
40640,Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.
40641,Always.
40642,"Great, let's go!"
40643,How are the young ones coming along?
40644,"I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down."
40645,"Welcome, traveler. Mind yourself in our town."
40646,"Hello, Nirya."
40648,"Do you really believe he would honor our agreement, or go running off to the highest bidder?"
40650,To me as well. I think we don't see the same tradition at play here.
40652,"Forget wine, women and wealth - give me a calm sea and a good book, and I'm happy."
40653,"Come on now, boy, you know what I meant..."
40655,Hafjorg! Where did you put it woman?!
40656,Nice weapon you have there. But I don't suppose you'd consider putting it away?
40657,I don't mean to confuse you.
40658,"You're a strong warrior, Skjor. Your heart is fiery and that serves you well in battle. "
40659,"Just stay close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me."
40660,But even the bravest of men consider their actions. I want you to survive long enough to take the mantle.
40662,Don't worry about me.
40663,"Sorry, but I have a treasure to get to..."
40665,"Vilkas, take her out to the yard and see what she can do."
40666,You never know what you'll find laying around in a crate or barrel. People toss the darnedest things in them.
40667,They grabbed me in Riften. They seem to think I know something. They just kept asking me the same damn questions.
40669,"Please, someone do something!"
40670,It's like it was in my dreams.
40671,I hope I can hear the screams. But don't let on it's from me! And I'm not paying your fine if you get caught.
40672,How do we know he's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
40675,Skjor has been a warrior for a long time. You would be wise to listen to him.
40676,No. Now shove off.
40677,"Don't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you."
40679,I just want to make sure I'm moving up.
40680,"You, have a request of me, Bulfrek? This should be interesting."
40681,"This house is huge. I'll be tripping my feet all over this place. Hey, I think I'll start a little business here. Something to do, you know?"
40682,I guide the Companions. The Circle advises me. But we are all free warriors. Only our honor binds us together.
40685,Why can't I train with Aela?
40687,It's just... I think our fighting styles are similar.
40689,They practically own the city of Markarth. And we're here on their coin.
40690,All aboard!
40691,Well you can either get better with a bow or try to learn from me. 
40692,We will bring the battle to their chief camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung.
40693,Should I be holding the blade further away than I would a smaller one?
40696,"No time, I have business to conduct."
40698,"If you keep it in close, you'll have more control, but it can be harder to balance a strike. "
40700,"I guess that comes down to footwork, then."
40701,It just feels so slow.
40702,"After that, the shortsword will feel like a knitting needle when you pick it up again."
40703,"It will feel that way for a while. But eventually you'll get used to it, and then you'll get faster with it."
40705,Are you prepared to die?
40709,"If you two are finished with the touching homecoming, there's a city in chaos out there."
40710,Let's just not be too obvious.
40711,"Oh, good point. I wish my head were made of rocks. "
40713,Leave that to me.
40714,"Breathe deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs."
40715,So what do you have to say for yourself? How can I be sure you're not an Imperial spy?
40716,"Oh, right, you were caught trying to cross the border into Skyrim, weren't you?"
40718,This is not J'zargo's fault!
40720,Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to the Throat of the World?
40721,"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? Am I making your life more difficult?"
40722,"That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our... well, in your line of work."
40723,I'm sorry. I was curious... I didn't believe the stories. I won't go over there ever again.
40726,Somebody do something!
40727,Only worry we've got is the war reaching this far.
40729,You're interfering with official Thalmor business.
40730,Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in combat.
40732,Just those same ruffians I was bringing in for the Shatter-Shields.
40734,"You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about."
40736,I'm imagining you just standing your ground and letting them tire themselves out.
40737,"Be glad you're here in the city, and not out in Riverwood. Those poor sods don't even have a wall."
40738,"We all have different means to glory, Stonearm. Well done."
40739,"My ears hear the truth in your words, and yet my body shakes with the need."
40740,We seem to have run out of Colovian brandy. I'll check in the wine cellar for more when I get a moment.
40742,"If Eorlund made it, it's more likely you're gripping it wrong. Find me tomorrow and we can go over it."
40744,I don't think that's how the Circle works. 
40746,Young warriors are smart to listen to older ones. They've lived. 
40747,"Pelagius Septim the Third, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him!"
40748,"What kind of weapon do you prefer? I like the smaller, quicker blades."
40749,"Yes, you're very fond of saying that. You know I like hammers and axes."
40751,Let's test that out some time.
40753,"Shut up, scum."
40755,"Okay, okay! I'll leave him alone! I was just kidding around. Besides, if he'd only kiss me, I wouldn't have to beat him up all the time..."
40760,"A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed."
40761,Yes. Braith bullies me all the time. All the elders think I'm a milk drinker 'cause I can't fight. Nobody understands.
40762,What did you tell them last time?
40763,Keep it to yourself. They're not paying us to talk.
40764,They'll be gone as soon as they've found whoever they're looking for. And we'll have all the more coin.
40766,Oh I know. Isn't it wonderful? I bet she squirmed like a skeever when you pulled them out of your pocket.
40768,"These look like good quality, too. I know it's not the glamorous, heroic work, but don't be surprised if I ask you to do it again."
40770,"Welcome, my brother. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you."
40772,"I guess some things never change. Thanks for bringing this to me. Here, for your trouble."
40773,"Dragonsreach occupies the highest, which we call the Cloud District. From here, the Jarl can see all that goes on within his city."
40774,"Most of the city's residents live in the Wind District, which is the middle of the three."
40775,The Plains District is so named because it's the closest of the three to the plains that surround the city. The inn and marketplace are found there.
40777,I understand. Hopefully I'll be able to save my meager earnings up to buy them one day.
40779,"Well, there are three of them. Arranged in three tiers, as you may have noticed."
40780,I've lost the way and wander blindly.
40782,"Do you think Ulfric really cares about Skyrim's independence, or the welfare or its people? I promise you, he doesn't."
40789,We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
40790,"Even now, my court wizard, Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these terrors. "
40793,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Falkreath.
40795,"The history of Whiterun begins with Jorrvaskr, the hall of the Companions. For a long time, it was the only building on the mountain."
40796,"If you need a meal or a room, I've got both."
40799,You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.
40800,"And so, from that time until this, our great keep has been called ""Dragonsreach."""
40801,"They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I will have his head."
40802,You'll have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in my right ear.
40803,I've... failed...
40806,"That is an old tale, but well known to those of us who serve in the keep."
40810,Elenwen always throws quite a party. I never miss one if I can help it.
40811,"Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me."
40814,"Gods, you are curious. Almost... dangerously so."
40815,"Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away."
40816,"When he became Jarl, I insisted on serving as his protector. He had no cause to argue."
40817,"Powerful men have many enemies. More so, in times of strife. So you can imagine the dangers."
40818,All right. But I am getting a bit tired of waiting.
40820,I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats.
40822,"Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them."
40823,And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely.
40824,"You're pretty tough, I respect that. Bringing in a lot of coin for the Guild, making us look good too. Let me know if you need anything, okay?"
40825,"And what, you think that'll solve all your problems?"
40827,"Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like old Olaf One-Eye once did."
40830,"But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival."
40831,"As long as I'm left alone to pursue my research, I don't care who gives the orders."
40832,"If I said that was a tedious question, would you be smart enough to know what I meant? Probably not."
40836,This is the most sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain of the world. 
40837,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
40838,"It's a hard way to make a living, but we find ways to make ends meet."
40840,You must understand. If Cicero is turning the others against me... against us... Our Family would not survive such division.
40841,"Orchendor and his Afflicted are meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with his Blessing."
40842,Oh no? So you're gonna fight back if I punch you? Huh? You're gonna hit a girl?
40843,What are you doing? I thought we were friends!
40844,"In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name."
40846,"Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person."
40847,So good to see you again. How can I be of service?
40848,Please get me home!
40849,"Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing!"
40850,"Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price."
40851,"So, what can I do for ya today?"
40853,"Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward!"
40854,"No. I have enough trouble without more mouths to feed! They're the Jarl's men, they can eat supper at the keep."
40857,"But instead, I wish to offer my services to you. If you ever wish to journey with me, I'll be here."
40858,"I left that old scab. Came home to Skyrim, and found this rabble of bandits."
40859,"Yeah? What do you want? If this is about the meadery, we can talk later."
40860,"After all, it is she who brings rain to our crops and fair weather on the harvest days."
40861,"To return to our glory and traditions, to determine our own future!"
40863,"I wish only an end to the fighting, so that I can tend to the temple once more."
40864,"As more of the sick and injured came to the temple, my work as a healer became more important than my duties as a priestess."
40865,"When the wounded soldiers began to return from battle, I did what I could to help them."
40866,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
40868,Not much work being a jailor. Long as you can ignore the pleading and all that.
40869,"Somewhat, yes. At first it seemed a distant thing, heard only in the idle speech of guards and traders."
40870,I feel a change in the room...
40871,"He did it. He actually managed to trap his own soul inside the Star, but it's falling apart. It needs more and more souls to sustain itself."
40872,"Youngest bard at the Bards College, at your service."
40875,If we were to... somehow... send a soul inside the Star. One that was ready to overpower Malyn from the inside....
40876,"By Sithis, you will pay for that!"
40877,"Hopefully these gifts will put us in her good graces, secure that import deal, and lead the way to an audience with the Emperor. "
40879,"Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now."
40880,You'll have to get the crystal to focus properly. Heat and cold will affect it; simple concentration spells should be enough.
40884,"A special type of soul trap. Placing you inside the Star without fully killing you. Once Malyn has been dealt with, I'll bring you back."
40885,Thanks again for the delivery to Markarth. What can I do for you?
40886,"But be careful. If you die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. There's nothing anyone can do for you if that happens."
40887,"Malyn's soul should be in the Star. Theoretically, purging him will be just like killing a ghost anywhere else."
40890,Hmm? What's this about?
40892,I just hope I can do right by the good folk who are looking to us to see to their needs.
40894,"Now, take a deep breath."
40895,"But his soul still resides within, protected by his enchantments. Until he is purged, my artifact is useless to you."
40896,"Well, yes. I was completely unaware of the reputation of the other party in this trade."
40898,What a waste. Fools.
40899,I know my mother would be worried about me. I'm here to let her know everything's all right.
40902,"I'm sorry, I'm just... you're right. Let me explain."
40903,Really? You're certainly... forthright about your criminal past.
40904,"I heard a rumor that these bandits were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here."
40905,"I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! Please, can you look for her?"
40906,"I've also received word from Markarth. It would seem Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good."
40910,"You heard the man, Tullius."
40912,Until you can find out whether Fjola is here there's nothing I care to to discuss.
40914,The ground is practically frozen. We can't dig down far enough.
40915,Fine.
40916,"I'm sorry. Keep the ring. I cannot bear the weight of them in my heart, and I must make the journey alone now. Thank you for... thank you."
40917,"What news have you heard from the war, Irnskar?"
40920,There's just one more thing I need from you. To fully absorb Gathrik's power I require a blood sacrifice.
40921,Thank you Klimmek. That's too kind.
40922,"All right, snowback. Who are you, and what are you doing in my tower?"
40926,We were... very close.
40927,"Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over."
40928,...
40932,To see the fires!
40936,"Ah, the prophecy. Be wary of prophecy. Some are meant as a guide. Some as a warning. Are you sure you can tell one from the other?"
40938,"You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, sister."
40939,Take out their archers!
40941,Have a look around. I buy and sell just about anything.
40942,"My mother's not any help, either."
40944,"A bit longer, yet. We need more money if we want to be chiefs of our own."
40946,I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the world and spread merriment.
40947,"I can commission one from the Radiant Raiment. It won't be cheap, but if you want the best, they're the only choice."
40951,"Wait a moment, you're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even our little Vex couldn't get in."
40954,Is this what our people fought and died for? To forsake our most beloved ancestor and divine?
40955,Ain't nothin' a boy can do that I can't do better.
40956,The ring itself is worth a few bits. Keep it as thanks for cutting off the last vestige of an unwanted fate.
40957,Take my wedding band. Stuhn only knows why I've kept it this long. He'll recognize it. Tell him whatever you think will convince him to leave.
40963,"Tell you what - you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff."
40965,You will have the honor of bringing a fresh kill for the main course. And I know the perfect person.
40967,I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.
40968,Turn back! Before he finds you!
40969,"Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely so pleasing."
40970,I didn't expect to see you again. What became of my doting husband?
40972,"She kissed me on the neck, and I got so cold that the fire didn't even hurt."
40973,"How did... no, forget it. I don't care to know. I'm free of the little man, and that's what matters."
40974,You fight like a child!
40975,"But being happy or unhappy is a choice you make, and I've chosen to make the best of things that I can."
40976,"Grelka, I wanted to talk about that suit of leather armor you sold me. The fasteners are already coming loose."
40977,"Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back..."
40978,Can't believe we let provincials like you wander around Skyrim.
40979,"A group of bandits descended on Dawnstar once... if it wasn't for the guard, who knows what they could have done to the place."
40980,"You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?"
40982,"They've been told to stay out of the city, but keep trying to get back in."
40983,"By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel."
40984,Battle-Born! Give me your money!
40985,We sure showed them!
40987,"No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me."
40988,"But only half right. I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to myself every few thousand years."
40989,Pour me an ale.
40990,Let's get back to Jorrvaskr. We'll want to pay our respects to Kodlak's spirit.
40991,It's good that you brought this to my attention.
40996,"All right, meat, it's time for you to earn your freedom. "
40998,"I was Jarl once, but I was encouraged to step down when I took sides with the Stormcloaks. It was an imperial plot, I tell you!"
41000,I'd also warn you not to cross her. She employs quite a few... troubleshooters  to take care of messy problems.
41001,You don't stand a chance!
41002,Gotta give the crowd a show.
41003, 
41004,"What is this, you think you're clever?"
41006,All right. Head to the pit when you think you're ready.
41008,Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes me a drink.
41009,"Well aren't you in luck. He's the next piece of gutter scum on the docket. Between you and me, I hope you cleave his arrogant head open."
41011,Gods. A woman attacked right on the streets.
41012,We offer this soul to The Revenant: he who watches over the opponents of Arkay and his power over life and death. Fie upon Arkay and his followers!
41014,"If I told you that, I'd be lying. We haven't had a bite in weeks. Our clients are starting to get angry."
41015,"That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes."
41016,"If you win, you go free. "
41017,"My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary."
41018,"We don't just let people rot in cells until they've served their time. Here, you fight."
41019,I will send word to her family that she is in good hands.
41022,"I think we could blow up half of Eastmarch, and people would still come to us for enchantments."
41023,There's no mistake. You're a wanted woman... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
41028,What do you want me to carry?
41029,"Smart man. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course."
41031,I'd like to know as much as we can about it.
41033,"He has shown us that our suffering is not a punishment, but a blessing."
41035,Wait!
41036,The Night Mother is part of you now! You get to hear voices inside your head! The rest of us should be so lucky.
41037,"Then it came again, this time more distinct. Closer. Definitely not lightning now. It was orange - brilliant orange, the color of hearth and dawn."
41038,Wait!
41039,I guess you get used to it.
41041,"I learned to forge when I was a pup, then I joined the Legion and mastered it."
41042,"But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land."
41044,That's a real shame. You would've fit the bill nicely.
41046,"You visit us often, Thadgeir."
41047,You did what was necessary. Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok - the arrogance of his power.
41048,The old Nords sure did love their stonework.
41049,"There are a lot of good men buried here, Kust."
41050,"Oh, I'd gladly sell it to you if you had the money."
41051,You're still alive!
41052,"War always comes down to this, doesn't it? A single truth-laden moment."
41055,The fields will need cutting soon.
41056,"Maro is dead, I know. But we've got bigger problems right now!"
41057,Most who arrive here do so because they have heard of the College beforehand.
41059,And now winter is coming.
41064,"Hello, my child. Arkay watch over you."
41066,Who are you? What brings you to my strunmah... my mountain?
41067,Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?
41069,"Tekla! It's good to see you, girl. How's Dengeir treating you?"
41071,"Oh, for the love of Mara. What now?"
41072,What?
41073,As he should I suppose.
41074,"And if you don't let me secure the steam channel, your leg could get blown off."
41077,"Hmmm, well don't take what you don't have to."
41080,Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her?
41082,Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
41084,"Right. Okay, tell me if you change yer mind."
41085,All this talk of dragons is making people antsy. Nonsense!
41087,Draugr are slow and clumsy. Hardly a challenge for a man like me.
41092,Got a mark taxed with carryin' a heavy item. Care to lighten' the load?
41095, 
41096,"Hey gossip, bring me a drink."
41097,"Bolund, you're going to die of thirst if you keep calling me that."
41098,"Groom her, too?"
41099,I'm surprised you're even showing your face around here after what you did.
41101,"The Gentle Repose is barren, it was barren the day my father claimed the land and it's barren now."
41106,"Yes, yes I do."
41107,How's the Corpselight treating you Mathies?
41108,Mathies. I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to your girl.
41109,"Some people say they watched over the group, others say they were reserved for the most elite jobs. I don't really know."
41110,"Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in jail, she's going to take over his meadery."
41111,"You know how farming is here, long days and little to show for it."
41113,"Very well, Talen. I'll remove myself from this den of iniquity."
41116,"We've been over this, Den. Tekla does not share your secrets with Siddgeir. "
41117,"No. I'm a Breton from High Rock, and I refuse to be mistaken for a filthy native. "
41118,"And we will lose customers. Let us hope that if there are dragons, there are only a few and they are not too foul-tempered."
41120,"So what's the news on the street, Captain?"
41122,Yes sir.
41124,Help us and you may earn a pardon.
41125,Thank you sir.
41126,"Falkreath is a fine place to be, Bolund."
41127,"Ulfric will allow Imperial forces into the Pale. Skald the Elder will go into exile, and Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship."
41128,They see me as master. Wuth. Onik. Old and wise. It is true I am old...
41129,Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.
41131,"Falkreath is our home, a place where we have good jobs under a good Jarl. Until the war comes to us we stay put."
41141,"I heard a scream and came running, but she was already... like this... when I got here."
41142,"Don't worry, Orthus. I'm doing my best to get you reassigned to Solitude."
41143,"Maybe, but the way you burn through all that wood to keep the cabin toasty, they might mistake this place for Elsweyr."
41144,Helvard! The guards are looking sloppy today. I want you to reduce their wages for the month. 
41146,"Um, excuse me. Could I buy two leeks."
41147,"Yes, yes, thank you and all that."
41148,I would think a man of your military training would be able to do with less but so be it.
41150,"If this isn't about official city business, you're wasting my time."
41151,"Yes. Their history and culture is all around us in Markarth. A race of stonecutters, artisans, and engineers."
41152,"I understand what potions do, but I don't always understand how they do it."
41155,Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?
41156,"The rebels called it ""The Markarth Incident."" It was the founding day for the Stormcloaks, and where this war really started."
41158,There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket.
41159,"It all started here. This rebellion. When the Empire lost the Reach during the Great War, we became desperate."
41160,"Funny you should ask. I'm in the market for a new locket. Something in polished silver, maybe. Big enough to hold, say, a folded-up letter?"
41165,"Look, I don't think I should say. I mean, they could kill me!"
41169,"A friend, huh? Well... then it's probably okay if I tell you."
41171,"Hadvar! We've been so worried about you! Come, you two must be hungry. Sit down and I'll get you something to eat."
41172,"Yes, I know. We have some advantages if they come here. The city is built into the mountainside, so it's hard to reach into even from the skies."
41173,"When I was a child, my village was burned to the ground by bandits. Do you know I actually saw one laugh as he ran my brother through..."
41175,The temple offers her blessings to pilgrims and instruction in enjoying all life has to offer.
41176,"I'm sorry to say I know very little about that... bee farm, was it?"
41180,"I'll go with you, but when things are back to normal I want an explanation."
41181,"Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn."
41183,"Once the war is over, I'll petition Ulfric to send the militia and we'll cleanse the Reach of this menace."
41190,"In the end, we took back Markarth, but those damn Forsworn still stalk the hills and roads, looking for revenge."
41194,The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired. 
41195,"If you're so curious, talk to Nelacar, in the Frozen Hearth. He can tell you the whole sad story."
41197,"Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can."
41201,"These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make things better, eh?"
41206,"Sun feels good, hmm?"
41209,Yes. Ever since mother died a few winters ago. I play songs and help with the drinks when I have the time.
41213,"J'zargo is pleased, and more than a little jealous, to greet the new Arch-Mage."
41215,"I've given standing orders to the guards to prepare water bucket runs to the harbor in case of a fire, but that's all we can do."
41216,"If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh."
41217,I'll fix you good!
41218,"Not that I actually want to see one, understand. I hope that dragon stays far away from here."
41221,"Remember, when you kill - we all wield the blade."
41222,Ssshhh.... Please. There is much... I have to say. And... not much time...
41224,The Star is being used to sustain Malyn's soul. I can't fix it while that fragment of him is inside.
41225,"As a result, we both feel that you'd make an excellent replacement for Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild."
41226,"When I find you, you're dead."
41227,"Riverwood's agreeable enough, I suppose. For a Nord village."
41228,"How goes the hunting, brother? "
41229,"Thanks to your efforts, the Guild's been restored to it's full strength and you've exposed the traitor in our midst."
41231,"Melaran, you lazy milk drinker, have you finished studying the imports from Black Marsh?"
41233,"I've never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't want it."
41234,"The pilgrimage is complete, I can feel it."
41235,"I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift."
41237,"Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known only to myself."
41238,"For what it's costing me, I should be handed the merchandise on a silver platter."
41240,Just don't lose yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation.
41241,"Those eyes. All right, killer, go on through. But don't try anything. Madanach knows more than you think."
41242,I work for the Silver-Bloods. Help clean.
41245,"All right, everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun!"
41246,"Aela will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp."
41248,You're not supposed to be here...
41249,"Then it's decided. When this entire sorry affair is over, we'll handle the details."
41250,"Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lass. This will be a fight to remember!"
41251,"I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand."
41252,"Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will be a fight to remember!"
41253,That's cheating. We're playing hide and seek. You have to find me before Laelette does.
41258,"Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please."
41261,I've been looking for you.
41263,"Why would anyone bother to study stars? Well, unless you're talking about that artifact that got all those... dimwits thrown out."
41264,New around Riften? Take my advice. Stay at the Bee and Barb... the Bunkhouse isn't for you.
41265,Gaaaaah!!!
41266,"Not quite worth handing over Riften, but not a bad starting point."
41267,I was such a fool. How could I let him use me like that?
41269,That was a long time ago.
41272,The Jarl does little to protect us these days.
41273,"The mages are up in the College. You can ask them, if they'll let you in."
41278,"This whole place appears to be a shrine to Reman. He ended the Akaviri invasion under mysterious circumstances, you recall."
41280,Welcome to Shor's Stone.
41281,"Oh, no, I'm not falling for that one again. Next thing I know, I'm getting yelled at for saying something inappropriate."
41282,You shouldn't ask me. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. He's the one to talk to.
41284,"Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call."
41285,"Strong, yes, but how clever are you? I'll tell you what, if you can open the lock on my chest, you can have everything in it."
41287,"I think one of them came back. Nelacar. Stays at the Frozen Hearth, but I don't know why. He's not welcome in the College."
41293,There was an... unfortunate incident a few years ago. An elven mage named Nelacar was exiled from the College over it.
41294,"Are you all right, Gat?"
41297,"Then one day I walked in and Malyn had... killed a student, and in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his work."
41299,"It's quite romantic, if you're an alchemist. Frost took the old fool a few seasons back, while he was looking for the Ring of Pure Mixtures."
41300,"Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm inside of Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to damn him."
41302,You'll have plenty of time to take it up with the King in Rags while you're serving a life sentence in Cidhna Mine.
41303,Too slow!
41304,"As a mortal, Malyn's soul was black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was close before... well, I already told you."
41305,"I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted? There's another rule the artifact follows."
41306,Who says I've settled down?
41307,Time to fight!
41311,"Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization."
41312,"Working for Erikur may be below my stature, but the compensation is... acceptable."
41313,"Well, is it taken care of?"
41315,Ugh. Your breath is foul. What've you been eating?
41317,"Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lad. Wealth is my business."
41318,Cowards! We must kill the vampires. We have to make them pay!
41321,"An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?"
41323,Intruder! Help!
41324,"Blasted war. I was due a new dress from Solitude, but it will never get here."
41328,"For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows."
41329,"If they do, we'll send them crying back to their boss again."
41330,Our newest members are housed here in the Hall of Attainment.
41331,There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of Dawnstar.
41332,"You have to keep your ward up, or else this won't work. I don't want to hurt you."
41333,No need to do that now.
41334,How dare you!
41336,"You just need to remember that there's a war on, and firewood isn't cheap these days."
41337,"So the Dragon Cult poisoned their own well, which explains the ghosts. However, Skorm thought the well was the key to entering the inner areas.  "
41339,"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my sister around. It's comforting."
41340,"You're a traveler, right? I have this letter for him. Let him know how much of a failure he is."
41341,"Yeah, I got one for sale."
41347,What? You're... can it really be true? Dragonborn?
41350,"Have it your way. I'll take the job, but don't expect a miracle."
41351,Here we go!
41353,"When I got close, the mercenaries Aringoth hired to protect the estate just waved me off. I don't think he wants visitors anymore."
41354,Ayarg garag gar!
41356,"If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted."
41361,It's time to put the weapon away now. Thank you.
41366,Time will prove me right.
41367,"That would be Jarl Skald the Elder. He's over in the White Hall, probably talking about Ulfric like he's the second coming of Talos."
41373,He's a fool. A dragon has attacked Helgen. Dawnstar needs the Empire now more than ever.
41374,Drowning your troubles in mead? A lot of folks are doing that these days. You'll want the Windpeak Inn.
41375,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
41377,"I hear they accept most people who apply, if you're ever interested."
41378,It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.
41382,"You mean before he died? We had a break in. Thieves didn't touch anything on the shelves, or any coin, just one thing."
41383,I'm ready when you are. Just give the word.
41386,"Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I sure did. It was one of my best pranks yet, father."
41387,Brina Merilis came in with the whole damn Legion and deposed Skald. Couldn't have happened to a better man.
41388,Turned on the Empire first chance he got. Now we're all part of this rebellion.
41393,"Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks."
41396,"Giants are a common problem in the Pale. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now."
41398,I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this plan of yours.
41399,"So, I've been hearing your name in court quite a bit lately."
41401,"Lead on, friend."
41402,"Tsk. How unfortunate. I had hoped you would honor an old man's dying wish. Well, let's be done with it then."
41404,Drem Yol Lok. Greetings.
41405,"Dragons? Well, that's fascinating. We should have someone look into that."
41406,I guess you're smarter than you look.
41407,"First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think it's a waste of time."
41409,"Take your pick. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead."
41410,"Our daughter, Fjotra, was taken from here. The Forsworn descended and... they didn't touch anything else. Just our little girl."
41412,Typical.
41415,Goraan! I feel younger than I have in many an age.
41417,Then prepare yourself to receive Stendarr's Mercy.
41419,"All I know is that the sap makes you feel as healthy as a cave troll, but slow as a drunk horker. And that and it fetches good coin."
41420,You're back. Have you done what I asked?
41421,"I've also heard that it was a spore that fell from an island floating in the sky, but that just sounds like nonsense."
41422,"Dear, you really ought to be careful with fire."
41423,"Some say that when Vvardenfell erupted, a piece was blown to the middle of Skyrim and from the crater grew the tree."
41424,How the tree came to grow there is a bit of a mystery...
41426,"Well met, hunter."
41428,Unworthy!
41431,"Here's your payment. Well earned, indeed."
41432,May the shroud of death embrace you.
41433,Although I have not practiced in a long time I was once a wizard. Even when I was young my magic was undeniably powerful.
41435,"Od - Ah - Viing. ""Winged Snow Hunter,"" as I read it."
41437,"Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come."
41442,"Mind yourself in front of the Jarl, or we'll have serious problems."
41443,"By taking back Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. We should never have given it up."
41445,"Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all. The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable."
41446,"Now, let us put this behind us and speak of it no more."
41448,"Now if you don't mind, I've got a city to keep."
41449,"Next time, deal with Avenicci."
41451,Enjoy your visit to Dragonsreach.
41453,"If you run into my husband Nazeem, remind him that he's not married to himself."
41454,"The measure of a man is taken at the moment of his death. And know this for truth, the ghosts of many heroes walk among us."
41456,Getting tired of hanging around talking all day. 
41457,"It don't matter what I grow - my Alvor, he'll eat anything."
41458,By the Twin Moons...
41459,"This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety."
41462,Here's the situation.
41465,Sure. Whatever.
41466,"Walk always in the light, in these days of darkness."
41467,I've got this. Do what you need to do.
41472,Brand-Shei... have you managed to find those boots for me?
41473,Stay vigilant! Our enemies are legion!
41475,"For a time he served his purpose, but that time has ended. He uses my gifts for his own amusement, and the only amusement I tolerate is my own."
41477,"Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?"
41478,"We're fighting because Skyrim needs heroes, and there's no one else but us."
41480,"Remember, fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Mostly."
41481,"Yes, sir."
41482,"Keep a song in your heart, and a blade in your boot."
41483,"No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut it or you'll ruin our ambush."
41485,This is the first time I've set foot in Windhelm. What a dreary place.
41486,Peace!
41488,A little girl is dead because of me.
41489,Roggvir. He opened a gate and they executed him for it.
41490,That we could avoid having to kill you.
41491,"Do be careful, child. Skyrim is not as safe as it used to be."
41492,"Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return."
41494,"Keep your eyes open for those Stormcloak dogs, yeah?"
41495,"Cunning warriors and skilled workers. It's good to have you here, Lash."
41496,I know you're here. Show yourself.
41497,Are you sure you can find your way? It would be easy to get lost in here.
41499,They say they're too busy with the war -- I say what good is winning a war if we're still terrorized by one of our own?
41500,"Gathering plants, picking mushrooms, brewing potions. It all gets so dreary after a while. This town needs something exciting to happen."
41502,I've been scrying and auguring to find the murderer myself.
41503,"We'll have to have a pint together sometime, you and me."
41505,"Next time, come see my at my shop. I've got some things you'll just love."
41507,Dinya? I was reading that missive you gave me and I was wondering something about marriage.
41508,Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?
41509,That voice is power!
41510,Some parting advice - women love sonnets.
41513,Oh! Oh! Maybe Cicero will go to Jorrvaskr and dance for the Companions! They'll... Um... On second thought... maybe not.
41515,"Now please, no more questions."
41517,"And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on."
41521,"Unmid, my sweet. Are we still meeting later for... combat training?"
41522,Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.
41524,I'm afraid the necklaces aren't selling well. Customers are not interested in medallions engraved with the symbols of other provinces.
41525,Do forget to see me at my shop sometime - Arcadia's Cauldron.
41526,"Yeah, take care."
41527,"Jarl Vignar, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?"
41528,"Excuse me, but I'm trying to read."
41533,"If you need any jewelry, just let me know."
41534,"Oh, never mind."
41535,Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.
41536,"We may not be trying to kill him, but he sure seems to be trying to kill us!"
41537,"Stop, in the name of the Jarl!"
41538,But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it.
41541,Someday the College may be fully accepted by the Nords. I hope that my work as Arch-Mage may help.
41542,We done?
41543,Aye.
41545,"If it's true that the dragons have returned, what will it mean for all of us? Is this how it all ends?"
41546,"If Maven Black-Briar keeps raising prices on mead, I'll have to resort to watering it down just to make ends meet."
41547,Excellent. I have a couple tasks for you.
41548,Mjoll the Lioness used to adventure across Skyrim before she settled down in Riften. I hear it all ended when she lost her enchanted blade.
41549,You've honored my father's memory in more ways than I have words to say.
41550,Straighten yourself out with the Guild and then maybe we can talk.
41556,To suddenly have all that wrenched away is like losing someone you hold dearly in your heart.
41557,Talos is part of our culture. He's part of our heritage and our tradition. He's Skyrim personified.
41558,"I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, despite your known Imperial sympathies."
41560,Thank you for getting her back from the Forsworn. Dibella was smart to have sent you.
41561,"But you're able to see the whole in the parts, and for that I'm grateful."
41564,"She died out there, only having tended to the wounded soldiers for a few months. We never even found her body... the Empire burned all the dead."
41565,What the?
41566,"Winterhold will be turned over to the Empire, although the College itself will retain its traditional neutrality."
41568,And do what? Losing a job from the Black-Briar family would make me a marked man. No one would ever take me on anywhere else.
41569,That's a dangerous game you're playing.
41571,It didn't matter. The Imperial soldiers cut her down... killed her like a dog and left her body to rot in the mud.
41572,So what do you want to know?
41573,I've seen some truly wondrous sights since I took to the seas. I had no idea a man could die in so many ways...
41575,"I believe so. Therefore, you are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found. "
41579,"It's no feast in their neck of the woods either. Last time I was up there, father said they were barely scraping by."
41580,"Go to the farm - the Loreius Farm. Just over there, off the road. Talk to Loreius. He has tools! He can help me! But he won't! He refuses!"
41582,That makes Twenty-Three. 
41583,"With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters."
41585,Seeing a good tavern brawl might be just the thing to lift my spirits.
41587,That's wonderful. You've done us a great service. As promised the outfit is yours and here's something for your trouble.
41588,My father was a Stormcloak soldier in his younger days. Now he just walks the streets spewing his hatred and propaganda.
41591,"But, I wouldn't go there if I were you. There's a whole group of them with axes and magic on their side. You'd never stand a chance."
41592,"Best of all, you don't have to pay the ridiculous prices Maven charges. So what do you say to that?"
41596,Nothing we can do for these ones now. 
41597,I don't like wizards and their spells. Give me an axe any day.
41598,Now is not a good time. Leave me alone.
41601,"Here you go. Oh, and keep it quiet. This stuff isn't exactly easy to get a hold of at these prices, if you catch my drift."
41603,"Suit yourself. If you change your mind, I'll be around."
41606,Indeed. We lost three soldiers in that attack. A sad day for Riften.
41607,Every now and then someone from the city comes by. Think they aren't used to seeing a Nord working for a Dark Elf.
41608,Good thing she makes so much money. Makes it easier for merchandise like this to fall through the cracks.
41610,"You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor."
41611,Sure. How do you think I get my hands on the good stuff and offer it so cheap? You think old Maven is just giving it away to anyone?
41613,"It's been better, I'll be honest with you."
41614,"For thousand-year old ruins, they're not much to look at."
41617,"Hey! You're the one who killed Alain Dufont, up in Raldbthar. Oh yeah, word about that got around. Man was a piece of bandit trash, is what I hear."
41619,The things you say are just an act to please mother.
41621,"Oh, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry..."
41622,"Fair enough. I thought you might be able to see past your Imperial loyalties in the interests of peace, but I guess not. Still..."
41623,No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later.
41624,"As promised, let me show you a thing or two about bargaining. Don't want some shifty merchant giving you a raw trade."
41625,"Is this about the stables? With my husband gone, my son Horm handles the business."
41626,"He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything."
41627,I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory.
41628,"No, my friend. That would be reckless. We have to help, but help in a way that doesn't directly place anyone in harm's way."
41630,At least Narfi has Reyda's Necklace... reminds Narfi of his sister. Thank you for giving this to Narfi.
41631,"Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out.  You see..."
41634,But why? Why must you stop Alduin?
41636,Then you're stupider than you look.
41644,We Argonians do the work the Nords don't want to do.
41645,"Oh yes, Cicero and the Listener! On the hunt!"
41646,One apple. Since the Blackbloods were dispatched I've had good luck getting shipments.
41647,"I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?"
41651,"Oh, but you are wrong."
41653,"It's time for you to leave, my friend."
41654,We're going to need an army to clear out that crypt.
41656,"These men are ruthless. Cunning, deceitful... they'll pay off whoever they can. I can't trust anyone here in Whiterun."
41657,I bleed for the people of the Reach!
41660,"I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon."
41661,Not now. I'm... much too upset to talk.
41662,"So, you bring that staff back here, and I'll consider it payment for the item Arniel was after."
41663,Jarl can refuse to see me all he likes. He can't ignore us forever.
41667,What are you lookin' at?
41670,"Hail, Companion."
41671,"Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you."
41673,"If you ever try and ""practice the Dibellan arts"" with Hemming again, I'll make sure that pretty little face loses its beauty."
41674,Find... Paratus... in Oculory...
41675,"I've never admitted this before, but I've killed more than I care to admit. I'll just leave it at that."
41676,None may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.
41677,There is no escape. Courage is useless.
41678,I do not know how he came to be caught. But the bronjun... the Jarl... was very proud of his pet. Paak!
41680,That's... all you've got?
41681,"But I cannot travel to Malacath's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need."
41682,Together.
41683,Yamarz has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave.
41684,"""Even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord,"" Skjor said when I joined. I think he meant it as a compliment."
41685,I need someone to do that to someone. I'll even pay.
41687,Curse this chill! I should have dressed more warmly.
41689,Aia. You're so mean. I don't think he means anything by it.
41691,Now Loreius. Loreius has learned the meaning of ugly.
41692,I try to hold us to the right path.
41694,"At least poor Sinderion died doing what he loved, his field research. I told the old fool he should take it easy, but he was too stubborn."
41697,As if I would write this dribble. How about we play a bit of turnabout with Faendal?
41698,On guard!
41699,"I... I'm grateful. It's just this... this isn't at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I was considering more, and..."
41700,"I know, I know, how could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared a few drinks?"
41701,"I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery!"
41702,"Wait, I can still fight. No, no I can't."
41703,"Riften. Cicero likes Riften. Cheats and ruffians and cutthroats abound. Finally, some fun."
41704,"Details, details. The Sanguine Rose breaks all the time and is fixed with but a thought. "
41705,You're working with the Daedra? Right. Now tell me the one about the Argonian Maid and the lusty baron.
41706,"A pleasant journey, milord."
41707,"Alduin's Wall was created by the ancient Akaviri Dragonguard, the forerunners of the Blades."
41709,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
41710,"Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood."
41711,Calcelmo's orders- no one gets through to the tower. Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need to.
41712,"Has the Thieves Guild visited you yet, Haelga?"
41713,"You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted."
41715,I'll kill you where you stand!
41717,You won't get away!
41718,All right. I'll take care of it.
41719,Imperial business. Be on your way.
41721,The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity.
41723,"Woman, you'll be the death of me yet. Fine, take your time. I'll just die of thirst in the heat of this forge."
41725,So that's a no I take it?
41728,"I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod. "
41729,I'm trying to do as little as possible. You're getting in the way of that.
41730,And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why she left you.
41735,It would be best if we spoke little until you've completed your task.
41736,"No problem, I'll get someone else to take it."
41737,"Please, reconsider what you're doing. Maybe I can pay later..."
41739,Is there anything more revolting than spiders? Too many legs...
41741,"I asked Falion if someday I could learn from the mages in Winterhold, but he doesn't like that idea."
41744,If you're not going use that armor you dropped... do you mind if I take it?
41747,What's important is that all of this work was designed to reveal to us sources of great magical power.
41748,"My mouth goes dry, and I start to shake."
41749,"Another batch of logs completely ruined. I swear, these bears have it out for me."
41750,"If word gets around that I bedded her, they'll lose all respect for me at the meadery."
41751,"Oh, right. Oh, well, things are going well enough. At least, as well as we can hope."
41752,"Divines, I'm tired. This is too much work."
41754,"Well it's about damn time. Capturing a woman from her home, keeping her bound like an animal. Ridiculous..."
41755,No!
41756,"Anything. Served in the Legion with my sister, Ghorza, for over 10 years. We've seen every piece you can imagine."
41760,You're nothing but a joke!
41762,Spare a septim?
41763,See ya' round.
41765,"Outta my way, stranger."
41768,"Only the bravest are allowed to lead, and to marry. A great chief is able to attract many wives and raise bold children."
41769,"Next season, nephew. Next season for sure...."
41770,All right. What is it?
41771,"Ah, the new disciple. I hear you have quite the appetite."
41772,"Is there anything new I should be aware of, Mirabelle?"
41773,"When I was a young rascal, I broke a man's arm with a single punch. Course, I had a horseshoe hidden in my glove..."
41775,You should try that bit on the barkeep. Maybe get yourself a free drink.
41776,I'm sorry. My mind was just somewhere else. Did you need a room? Drink?
41779,Leave Idgrod and her family alone. They've been through enough.
41780,"Don't let the men take advantage of you, always be on your guard."
41781,I am yours to command.
41785,"None of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just do it already!"
41787,"When the Stormcloaks took Solitude, I thought for sure things would slow down. But they keep me just as busy as the Imperials."
41788,"I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, to try and get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. And... he actually pulled it off!"
41791,Feast your eyes on my strange and wondrous collection of curiosities.
41792,"I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, and is trying to get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. That would be so wonderful."
41794,"Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of ""Dah."""
41797,"The resistance against the Dominion is alive and well in Hammerfell, and they want justice."
41798,"Sorry, was only joking with you."
41799,"Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!"
41800,"You deal with them, I'll make sure you get paid. Maybe this old soldier will throw in some lessons as well."
41801,"Ah Tekla, you're a pretty little mouse."
41803,"Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. He's really doing it!"
41805,"Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!"
41808,"You have the Jarl's confidence, friend. And so you have mine."
41809,"I... I'm sorry Haelga, I can't. Not yet."
41810,So. You're one of Ulfric's spies...
41811,"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
41813,"They're none of her business, and none of yours either."
41815,"Yes, Grelod."
41817,"Now we can't cut them, and can't afford to buy another mill somewhere else. "
41819,I'm lucky enough that none of my friends have been killed. Of course we have soldiers coming through all the time.
41820,"Vekel and me, we have a thing going. Try anything with him and it'd be bad for your health."
41821,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
41823,"I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague."
41825,"Look, Shadr. Last warning. Pay up or else. All I care about is the gold. Everything else is your problem."
41826,Those falls... dangerous place. Derkeethus thought he could find some good fish in the pools. 
41827,By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain...
41829,"The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it."
41832,All we can do now is rebuild.
41834,So it seems the milk drinkers were right. That dragon was nearly the death of us.
41836,Dead dragons... it hasn't moved since Ysgramor and it's not going to start now. Superstitious milk drinkers.
41840,Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.
41841,Bad people who don't like werewolves. 
41843,Ever tried making your own? It's... not easy. Trust me.
41845,"Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore."
41846,"Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you much right now... I'm currently in mourning."
41848,The ceremony you so rudely interrupted was the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil.
41849,"Don't worry, the time will come when we can walk away from here."
41853,Mages in Cyrodiil are all about politics. The Synod and the College of Whispers are too busy guarding secrets to bother to teach.
41854,Very good.
41855,They demand the Moot.
41858,"I feel that it's time to put aside the grievances of the past, and let peace and prosperity flourish between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion."
41859,"Yes, you. You, who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient bones. I give you this task - journey to Volunruud. Speak with Amaund Motierre."
41865,You must really need that.
41868,But she's so stupid!
41869,Has the Warmth of Mara been given to Riften?
41870,"Well, look at the evidence. Nords generally don't trust magic, so it's not off to a good start."
41872,"A person who is looking for a spouse simply wears an Amulet of Mara about the neck, showing they are available."
41876,I have something to say first.
41877,"Sure, we can talk a minute."
41878, 
41880,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
41882,You... You can see me?
41883,"Confound it all. I was quite sure I was invisible, or at least transparent."
41887,But I'm sure those Skyrim dogs would stand down if the keepers of the tales showed their patriotism!
41888,"The existence of so-called ""Doomstones"" throughout Skyrim has been repeatedly verified. The meaning of these stones has not."
41893,They can turn the tide of a battle in a moment's notice.
41894,"Oh my, that's quite a difficult question."
41896,You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell.
41897,Bone-Breaker.
41898,"I undertstand. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here, please."
41901,Don't get too far ahead.
41902,"Faralda. Don't act like she didn't say anything. I know her, I know what she's been up to."
41905,Are those parts ready yet?
41906,You think so? Let's see who the real woman is here.
41908,"Lead her to the Whiterun stables, outside of the city. We will wait for you there."
41910,"If you need to sample some of the finest mead in Skyrim, you're in the right place."
41914,"Keerava, certainly we can come to some sort of an understanding. These people must be made aware of the chaos they've sown."
41916,"Hmm. Yes, it is quite sad. A young boy, Aventus Aretino, lost his mother recently, and was sent to an orphanage."
41917,"Straight to the point, eh? No need for tedious hows and whys. I like that. Leave those details to your betters, am I right?"
41921,"If I am to die today, so be it. But you'll not soon forget the Dark Brotherhood."
41922,This is your final hour!
41924,Return when you have completed the Great Hunt.
41925,Good luck out there!
41927,Vah!
41931,"If you wish to commune with Him, we'll need the incense."
41936,"Why do we always focus on retelling the old stories? There are so many new stories being made, right now..."
41937,M'aiq does not remember his childhood. Perhaps he never had one.
41939,"Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot, a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how."
41941,"If the Circle vouches for you, I'm sworn to respect their judgment. But that doesn't mean I like it."
41942,"Please, get word to my mother."
41945,Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger.
41946,"Welcome to our stronghold, Blood-Kin."
41947,"Of course. I should've known. Avulstein was behind this, wasn't he?"
41952,So he might still be in there?
41953,"They'll go looking for me, and Whiterun will be the first place they search."
41954,"A wise decision, but I fear he may not be safe there anymore."
41957,My husband died. Things won't be the same without him.
41958,"Occasionally I'll give you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll earn yourself a bonus."
41959,You're making this too easy!
41960,"I see no harm in it, if you have the skill."
41962,"But would you do me a favor? Tell my mother to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll know what it means."
41966,You'll be looking to rent Tiber Septim's room I take it?
41967,"Wallow in your wretchedness, my newest champion."
41972,The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um - the first Tongues. The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin.
41973,"Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of others."
41974,This is not where Teeba-Ei was meant to live out the rest of his days.
41975,The flour mill!
41976,Who will start?
41978,That's why I come here to talk to you. You're all heart.
41979,(woof!)
41980,"Nords can be quite stubborn. They're slow to change their ways, and we find more heretics every day."
41981,"When I found this town, with its huge cemetery, I felt right at home. I opened the shop and I've never looked back. This is where I belong."
41982,"Well, my family back in Hammerfell didn't approve of my interest in lethal poisons and death in general. So I left, and wandered north."
41984,A true Nord places loyalty and honor above all else. 
41985,We're fighting because we're done bleeding for an Empire that won't bleed for us.
41987,I wouldn't hold out too much hope.
41989,"I'll count to three and then say ""go."" You have ten seconds to hit each of the four targets. Draw string and get ready."
41990,"It's probably more trouble to pack up and leave than it is to stay. Besides, Ambarys can't run the cornerclub on his own."
41991,"I was once, but not any more. I was wounded in a skirmish up near Windhelm. This was years ago, mind you."
41993,You'll listen to this.
41994,Show those marauders what Windhelm justice tastes like.
41995,My miners are as dumb as rocks are grey.
41996,"Come on, he's not so tough."
41997,"The Elder Scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones, though. To bring about the opening."
41998,We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing.
41999,"Be careful, Niluva is a bit... aggressive when she's cornered."
42002,"For another, I won't get mixed up with criminals and other sorts who take advantage of the honest folk for profit."
42003,"Worse. The Khajiit Caravans are the only way to get supplies into the city, and even those are becoming more infrequent."
42005,Funny.
42009,"An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions? "
42010,"Aye, not so long ago. Some'll tell you I stepped down on account of my old age."
42012,"No, that won't be necessary. You'll have compensation for your loss."
42014,"Everywhere he looks, he sees assassins, spies an' plots against him. I'm the only one he confides in."
42015,"Everyone knows General Tullius wields the real power Solitude. Elisif? Ah, she's a figurehead. A puppet."
42016,Beautiful baubles and gleaming gemstones over here!
42017,I like the loyalty of a dog. Not as fickle as a wolf.
42018,Finally...
42020,"Here you go, sir. Colovian brandy."
42022,"There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free people of Skyrim."
42024,I want no mercy for those Forsworn. Understand?
42025,"What? I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood. I'm not permitted to leave the party."
42026,"Yes, let's get this over with."
42027,Pickpocket! We've got a pickpocket!
42028,Are you sure?
42029,We should get started.
42030,I'm here because it's required of me. But there's nothing to be gained by talking to that murderer.
42031,"I own the Pelagia Farm, just outside the city walls. Nimriel takes good care of things for me."
42032,"My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago."
42033,These terms are satisfactory to my government. The truce is unlikely to last long in any case.
42034,Hhhhhhuuuuuuaaaaaa!
42037,"Jarl Skald is upset over the loss of Dawnstar. I'll admit, it's less I have to worry about."
42038,I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the Blades is a choice you will come to regret.
42040,What a waste.
42041,"It comforts me to know that, Bolgeir."
42042,I'll try and hold them off as best I can. You get back to the Sanctuary!
42043,No sign of 'em.
42044,We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.
42045,"But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?"
42046,"If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal."
42047,"You've done well, to even get the two of them in the same room."
42052,"Skjor thinks you should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you."
42053,I'd just as soon get this over with.
42054,I can't wait to see who succeeds Mirabelle. I've no doubt she'll be promoted to Arch-Mage at some point.
42055,I never thought I'd ever willingly stand in the same room with Tullius again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.
42057,"Don't worry, I'll come to this peace council of yours."
42058,Is everyone here? Let's get this started.
42062,"Wait. You win. I'll ease off on the beatings, just leave me alone."
42064,Private Morrard... Angela's daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told.
42065,I sacrificed a lot here today for this plan of yours.
42066,"He owes this tavern enough coin to burn it down, build it back up, then burn it down again just for laughs."
42068,"When I return to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready to help trap this dragon."
42069,"As soon as I get back to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready."
42070,I hope this truce gives you what you need. It won't last.
42071,"You fight well, sister."
42072,I'm just a servant. Don't pay me any mind.
42073,Oof!
42076,I don't know you.
42079,Changed your mind? You ready to pledge your blood and honor for Skyrim's freedom?
42081,"I'd say you're either brave or stupid, but I can already tell which one it is."
42082,"I'm glad you're here. I need you to kill a Coldhearted Gravedigger, tends to work in the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm. This is all the gold I have."
42083,"The Forsworn are strange men. They fight to reclaim Markarth, but they live like savages."
42086,You have my thanks.
42088,"If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic."
42089,Don't blame me if your feet get sore.
42090,"Look, I'm busy. Please go bother somebody else."
42091,Your a hard woman to please Una.
42094,"I'm afraid that's it, my friend. I've done all I can. I hope the place is at least livable now. Good luck with, your, um... murders."
42101,"Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people."
42105,"Tell me what you need, and I'll get my people get on it."
42107,"Please, no more. I'll pay, I'll pay. Here!"
42109,Stay away from the Aretino Residence. The place is cursed.
42110,The person who writes it.
42111,"Don't worry, Arkay's protection is absolute."
42112,(yawn) I'm so tired...
42113,Are you of the sort that believe you're here to change the world? Or are you only in it for yourself?
42115,"Another new Apprentice, I see."
42118,I'm going to check the entrance to the Ratway. Be right back.
42121,"No. She said my part was over. That my fate had moved beyond the Twilight, and I was on my own."
42122,Ohh... but I will have your blood...
42123,"By Shor, is that... is that Azura's Star? How did you come to possess such a rare treasure?"
42124,"The Augur? Really? Well, it's certainly not my place to say anything about it."
42125,I think we have a nice wealthy home for you to break into. Think you can clear the place of valuables and keep it quiet?
42127,"Not within society, no. Many who practice within the school of Conjuration do so on their own, secretly."
42128,"He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a ""proper Nord worker."" My people are not slaves!"
42132,"He didn't like the Arch-Mage. Hated dealing with him, hated having to answer to him."
42135,"Well, J'zargo is surprised. And pleased! There is real competition here. This is good."
42137,It is good to finally be around mages who may be able to keep up with J'zargo.
42141,J'zargo hoped there might be one who could keep pace with his accomplishments.
42143,Let's see where this goes. Better than going back outside with that dragon.
42145,There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!
42147,"Staying out of trouble, kinsman?"
42148,I'll also notify my guards of your new title.
42150,A little bit of old Reach magic can cure whatever ills you....
42151,The Dragonrend Shout is evil. Would you cure one evil with another?
42152,Agggh!
42154,"You are looking for Arkay's protection while you delve some dank tomb, I take it?"
42156,"Treasure, you say?"
42158,I would hate to think what would happen if this fell into enemy hands.
42159,"Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech."
42161,I need another drink.
42162,I've heard stories about the wonders of the great Temple in Markarth. 
42166,I suppose I can come with you for a short venture. Lead on.
42168,"Uh, sorry."
42169,Thanks!
42171,'Accidents' like this don't just happen! Someone is trying to sabotage my uncle's research!
42172,Ruth wah nivahriin joor!
42174,"Captain Kjar expects the best, but he's a fair man. He never fails to reward hard work and loyalty."
42175,Carriages to all the cities in Skyrim. Don't forget us.
42176,A dragon.... First in a thousand years....
42179,"But J'zargo works so hard, there is no time to test these new spells. If you help with the testing, this will make learning easier."
42181,I'm disappointed to say I've learned little during my time here.
42182,We get Riften back. Now we'll see if there's anything behind your fine words.
42183,"I know how this works, Tullius. I've learned the value of Imperial promises the hard way. Never again."
42185,You're losing this war and you know it.
42188,You slaughtered the very people you claim to be fighting for! True sons of Skyrim would never do such things.
42189,"I hope one day I'll convince Rustleif to take us back there. Until then, I'm content running the forge together here in Dawnstar."
42190,Well said! You may be fighting on the wrong side in this war.
42191,I've ventured into quite a few Nord ruins in my day.
42192,Hey you! Let me out! I can help!
42195,"No one talks to Madanach, I'm afraid. Not without getting past Borkul the Beast."
42196,What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?
42198,"Kerah, do you have anything... exotic? Something no other woman in Markarth would be wearing."
42199,Okay. You're it!
42202,I'll find you...
42203,"As I expected, you favor your friends."
42205,You... you disappointed me. You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.
42206,Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed Skyrim at every turn.
42207,You should think harder on your commitment to Skyrim's freedom next time you're deciding what's right.
42208,I'm sure that will be a great comfort to the families of your comrades who died to free the land you just gave back to the Empire.
42210,"I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong."
42212, 
42214,By the gods... I don't even know what to say...
42216,"Mind you, it's no business of mine what each Companion does in the name of honor. "
42217,"Very honorable, I'm sure, but you should not put your own honor above the freedom of Skyrim."
42219,But don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm.
42220,"She needs to learn to eat what I serve her. I swear, you spoil that child rotten. Besides, it's one of your favorites."
42221,"We are not welcome here in Whiterun, so we will be in Rorikstead if you learn anything."
42222,You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a son of Skyrim.
42223,"Ulfric showed his true colors today, eh? Don't worry. You aren't the first to be taken in by his self-serving lies."
42224,"Excellent! You aren't the first to have a change of heart, after seeing what Ulfric's reckless pride is doing to Skyrim."
42227,"Come on, Ulfric. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both."
42228,"For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare."
42229,"If you really are Dragonborn, then Skyrim needs you. Go to High Hrothgar and talk to the Greybeards."
42230,"Jarl gets booted from Dawnstar, and I'm still stuck cleaning up the dirt."
42232,Because Tolfdir says so. He says there are things to learn here.
42233,You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Markarth on these terms.
42234,Ever see someone killed with their own weapon? Would you like to?
42236,Fiik...
42238,"Out with it, then."
42240,"I've found the final resting place of the Jagged Crown. Can you believe it? Well, I'm almost certain."
42242,"That's enough, Thongvor. We're done."
42244,"That's what started this whole war. The Empire couldn't ignore that. Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days."
42245,Assur and I are playing a game. Don't tell him where I am!
42250,"We want Hjaalmarch back, and Idgrod Ravencrone restored as Jarl."
42251,"You, meat! Come, come."
42252,Such a shame. Perhaps another time then.
42254,We want compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
42255,"Give us a coin, Cosnach. You'll just spend it on cheap ale, anyway."
42256,We want compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
42257,"Mistress, the people of Solitude are destitute. Many are starving and desperate for work. We need to be more active, to reach out to them."
42258,"He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him."
42259,We must succeed here today.
42260,We want compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
42262,"What are you, some kind of barbarian? Don't care for armor?"
42263,"I'll admit, I'm having trouble coming to terms with all of this. I'll just follow Nazir's lead."
42266,We want compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
42267,We want compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
42269,Fortune smiles upon this meeting.
42271,So you're interested in my potions and ingredients?
42272,"I wish I could be an adventurer like you, and go wherever I want."
42274,"What next, Tullius? Shall I just hand over all of Skyrim?"
42276,"Why would I give you that, if I wouldn't give you Riften?"
42277,I guess I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
42280,"Jarl Baalgruf, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?"
42281,"Well that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little detail, have you?"
42282,"Orc town nearby. Between you and me, we should have had them out years ago."
42283,"I admit, I really didn't expect you'd be able to arrange a truce. Getting Ulfric to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement."
42284,Think you can go blade to blade with me? You'd be dead in six seconds.
42285,"Giving up Markarth is a heavy price for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it."
42287,"This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And General Tullius. Riften is ours!"
42288,"Yes, I'm ready to do my part."
42289,"That's not fair, now."
42290,"Well, first an' foremost there's repairs to make an' wounds to heal. Folks are depending on us getting the city back in working order."
42291,You'll want to be careful travelin' at night. The marsh is a dangerous place.
42292,"He's proud of his service, Skald. The Legion taught us loyalty. And we're loyal to Dawnstar."
42295,No one.
42297,There'd better be. I didn't come all this way to leave empty handed.
42298,I hear there's a priest of Mara visiting the inn. Maybe the Divines will cure us.
42299,"Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it."
42300,Hmm. These doors seem to be the only thing left between me and the treasure.
42301,"I... oh, all right. If there is a thief, he won't leave this tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?"
42304,"All right men, spread out and search the tower. No telling who- or what- we're dealing with here."
42305,Have you heard from your family recently?
42306,What a waste! There must be a dozen men up there!
42307,Yeah. Calcelmo called in his entire expedition team- said he needed every man he could get to protect his research.
42308,"I can't even keep track of all the people who have been in and out of this fort. They come, they go. I barely notice."
42309,Just remember everything I've taught you and you should be able to complete it.
42311,"Well, at least this post is safe enough. Come on, let's get back to work."
42314,"...As you say, sir."
42316,What do you think this is?
42317,What the...?
42318,"Everyone, fall back! Run for it!"
42319,You look a little sturdier than most of the Popinjays around here.
42320,Follow me. Master Borri will test your Whirlwind Sprint.
42321,"I wasn't hurt, but that did make me feel better."
42322,Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.
42323,"No, no... please, I'm just tired is all. Thank you."
42325,"You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue."
42326,"That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on you travels, kill them."
42327,"Damn that Loreius. Oh, how he will pay for this treachery..."
42328,The braggarts in the Reach always claim that no prisoner escapes their mine.
42329,Too bad you don't have that much. Guess you'll have to walk.
42333,"What do you need, Dragonborn?"
42337,You idiot. You came all the way down here for that?
42338,"Since we're all here at your request, I'd like to hear what you think Markarth is worth."
42339,"Oh. Well, that's... awkward. Sorry to have brought it up."
42340,"Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these."
42341,"If it's any comfort, I do feel slightly bad about Veezara. Stupid lizard got in my way! But please tell me that hulking sheepdog has bled to death."
42343,Our terms are simple.
42344,Riften must be returned to Imperial control. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
42346,Do you really think Ulfric will just turn Riften over because some Imperial general barked an order?
42348,All hail the Emperor. All hail his Legionnaires!
42349,Really?
42350,I'm sure General Tullius does not expect something for nothing.
42351,"Come on, Tullius, you can't seriously expect us to just hand over Riften at the negotiating table."
42353,"Jarl Ulfric, what would you want in return?"
42354,Bah! Is there no one who can offer a challenge?
42355,"First, let me be clear. The sons of Skyrim know from bitter experience that talking to the Empire is a waste of time, or worse."
42356,"Puttin' together another shipment from Morrowind, Vekel. Lookin' for anythin' special?"
42357,"Good job. The more citizens that join the fight against the rebels, the sooner they will see the futility of their rebellion."
42360,"If you want my opinion, I think they should have paid for an entire quartet. Plenty of bards at the College would have loved the opportunity."
42365,"You mean, after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will still... honor the contract?"
42366,"And if you want to do business in Tamriel these days, well, you'd better get used to cozying up to the Thalmor. Like it or not."
42367,Perhaps this world is simply the Egg of the next kalpa? Lein vokiin? Would you stop the next world from being born?
42368,You can have anything except the scroll of course.
42369,"No, but that won't account for the size issue. Blast, if only so many of these creatures hadn't escaped."
42370,Paarthurnax is the only one who can answer your questions about Dragonrend.
42371,"Well, hurry up."
42374,"Hey, hey. Sorry. I just get jealous when I hear rumors about you."
42375,Then we've no time to lose. Follow me!
42377,Don't fall behind!
42382,"They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? ""Season unending""... so it has proved."
42385,I don't dare leave the house myself. So I need your help.
42386,"""Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor, Titus Mede II..."""
42388,Take your seat at the council table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of Skyrim.
42390,Hooray!
42391,"I'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you have the gall to ask me that?"
42392,"Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!"
42394,Just sit back. This won't take long.
42396,Nope. Sold my last one to some stranger.
42397,"Is everything well with you, my scaly friend?"
42398,"My father, Mralki, manages the inn. He used to be a soldier, but he left that life behind."
42399,"But no, it is not in my possession."
42402,"Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to..."
42403, 
42405,Galmar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
42407,"Yes, my lord."
42408,"Well, I was right, wasn't I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had warped it!"
42409,"Enough, Galmar."
42415,"Yes. With Markarth in our hands, we'll be able to raid the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude..."
42416,Dawnstar has always held its own against the bandits and wild animals of the Pale.
42417,Whiterun seems like a better choice to me. From there we can threaten to undermine the whole Imperial position.
42420,Now that's what I like to hear. Off you go.
42425,I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.
42426,Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in someone who may be dead tomorrow.
42427,"Excellent news. Were it to have gotten out of hand, it could have become a major problem for the College."
42428,Yeeeaaagghh!
42429,Now hit the target to the left.
42430,"Oh, thank you. The dogs were getting restless."
42431,"Shout for us, Dragonborn. Then we may have time for questions."
42433,At last.
42434,You can't just leave me here!
42435,"I can assure you, it's all fresh. I hunt the game myself, every day."
42436,Grant us this power so that in your name we may vanquish our enemies.
42437,Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.
42438,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
42439,"It's just children playing, Haran. I wouldn't fret over it."
42441,"""The bloodiest beef in the Reach!"" Ha ha ha."
42442,"And what do you do? Nothing! Not... not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys!"
42443,No problem.
42444,We know what path you've set him on. But he has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
42445,"I'm a pirate, sweetie. Assassination attempts are an occupational hazard. Now, shall we?"
42448,"Umm... You dropped a piece armor over there. I was kind of hoping that I could, you know, have it?"
42449,"I know what path you set her on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most."
42452,"Mind my words or I'll mind them for you: I'm slave to no man, no god, and no Daedra."
42453,We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the city. I thought you should be the one to have it.
42454,Well I can't just tell that to any skeever that washes up. 
42457,"Delphine, we're not here to rehearse old grudges."
42458,We know a great deal about the situation and the threat that Alduin poses to us all. You need us here if you want this council to succeed.
42460,You should try the venison. It's delicious.
42461,"I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's no need to have him thrown out on my account."
42462,The matter at hand is urgent. Alduin must be stopped. You wouldn't have called this council if you didn't agree.
42467,Which one was the rat?
42468,"Excellent! Thank you... Here, take this as, um, a sign of my gratitude. It's not much, but I hope it's enough."
42469,"I have no authority to negotiate a permanent settlement, unless Ulfric is ready to sue for peace and turn himself over to Imperial justice."
42470,It is done. I won't go back to Avanchnzel. I won't.
42473,"The College is an asset to Skyrim, even if it goes unnoticed or unappreciated."
42474,"My dear boy, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?"
42475,Please remain indoors at night. It is dangerous to go outside.
42476,Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man...
42479,"If you've business with the Jarl, I'd ask that you speak to me first."
42480,Fine. Let's get this over with.
42484,"You're... probably right. Just hurry, please. Who knows what those things are doing to her."
42485,"This world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will be misused."
42487,"No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is going to know that when I get back."
42488,"Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you."
42490,I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother.
42491,"But for now, you're off to speak to Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by name."
42493,I enjoy steady patronage in the Bannered Mare. I do hope you'll watch me perform.
42494,"If you're in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know."
42495,"She's put me in charge of keeping the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do."
42497,"Hmph, yeah I did. That wood elf s'wit... he's a lot smarter than I expected."
42499,"When you showed up here, I knew you were the one the Greybeards sent, and not some Thalmor plant."
42501,I knew the Greybeards would send you there if they thought you were Dragonborn. They're nothing if not predictable.
42503,"I saw you working the forge today, wife. Your muscles have grown strong from the metal shaping!"
42504,You're going to Fort Kastav.
42505,"Nope, sorry. Nothing."
42506,Please hurry. We are counting on you.
42508,"By the gods, when I get out of here you're dead! You hear me? Dead!"
42509,You. Over here!
42510,"Besides, I also prefer the quiet. I didn't open this business for browsing. Come in, buy what you need and get out."
42512,You of course know that the Night Mother is our Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the children of Sithis.
42514,"Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me."
42515,Talos smite you!
42517,I can't afford to have another Sarthis blunder into Riften because they think we're too lazy to disrupt their pitiful operation.
42518,Then I want you to head out there immediately and eliminate all of them.
42519,Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.
42522,"Yeah, my problem is I'm too tired to punch your face in."
42525,"Kill well, and often."
42529,"This place, it's like a maze. How did the dwarves find their way around?"
42530,One of these days we need to head back to the Rift. Get some of that good Riften mead. 
42531,But the leaders of the uprising refused our offers of peace. They fled into the hills and became the Forsworn.
42533,"I do, but some folk here think he set the fire himself."
42536,I need to ask you to stop. That... shouting... is making people nervous. 
42538,"Besides, you have your own score to settle with the Empire now. And with that dragon."
42539,It's not worth dying over.
42540,It's all on account of this blasted ring.
42542,"I'm sorry, Betrid. I'll clean them right away."
42543,I'll never forget you.
42545,You'd better find that chest that fell off the boat or Gulum-Ei will have your hide!
42550,"When I go away, I go to war. That's no place for a little girl."
42551,You can't get inside though. They've kept that place locked up tight since the war began.
42552,A god? Assuredly not! When was the last time you saw evidence of Aedra in the world?
42553,"You risk death by doing so, and you shall not gain entry."
42555,"Get yourself kitted out with what you need. Welcome to the fight, brother!"
42556,"If it wasn't for skooma, I'd already be on my way out of this horrible city."
42557,"I do what's necessary so we can get by. Have to, since I can't count on my brother for anything."
42559,There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.
42560,There's the Blades agent! Kill him!
42561,Kraldar has big plans for Winterhold. We'd be better off if he was in charge.
42562,"However, if you'd wish to eliminate that burden for me... well, let's just say it would go a long way with earning my favor."
42564,"Ah yes, Sarthis... a thorn in my side for the last few years."
42565,"However, if you'd take care of this discreetly, you might be able to surprise him without warning."
42566,I am prepared to deal with your insolence...
42568,"Yes, I'm afraid we're aware of Sarthis's presence in the warehouse."
42569,It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck... by placing their hands in ours.
42570,I'll take a sword or mace over a pick axe any day.
42574,"Good. Here, take the key to the warehouse."
42576,Let me give you a word of advice.
42581,It will be my pleasure.
42585,"In a fight, if you see a big wind up, get out of the way or bash him with your shield. Attacks like that go right through a regular block."
42586,Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn.
42587,"Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way, go right ahead."
42589,We'll be sending generous resources to Ulfric. As much as the Reach can bleed.
42591,"Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to."
42593,"Unlike my husband Kleppr, I watch after our guests."
42594,"Hold on, my dear. Hold on!"
42597,"I've never seen anything like this in Nordic ruins before. Why, just look at all these coffins!"
42598,Can't imagine what the College expects to find in here.
42601,But why?
42603,That's about the truth of it. Write tales about the sights I've seen. The battles I've fought.
42605,"You are but a dog, and I am your master!"
42606,I'll be over here if you need any potions or ingredients.
42607,"Among other things, the Dwemer were expert trap-makers. Watch the floor for tripwires and false plates."
42608,Time for you humans to learn your place!
42609,Foolish human. Your time is at its end!
42610,"Arniel, stay on your guard. We can't let harm come to these people."
42611,The Forsworn will reclaim what is rightfully ours!
42613,Come. Come and face the Forsworn...
42614, 
42616,"No, I don't think so. Not today."
42617,"I'll look around the house and if I find it, I'll bring it to you right away."
42619,Took your sweet time getting it to me.
42620,Can't wait to count out your coin...
42623,"I met Alain in the tavern, while I was... drinking my sadness away. He was handsome, and charming. He said I was the ""beautiful lily"" of his dreams."
42624,"Haven't seen you here before, egg brother. Welcome!"
42625,"I'm afraid I'll have to take that Staff from you now. Ancano wants it kept safe... oh, and he wants you dead."
42627,"In fact, here it is now. Think of it - a never-ending stream of minions. And all of the prestige of being Sanguine's chosen."
42628,"The Gray Quarter's not much to look at now, but it wasn't always so bad."
42629,My thirst will be sated...
42631,You wish to trade in Orc steel?
42632,You're headed to Morthal.
42634,"The walls have ears and you're being tested, lad. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon."
42635,Waaagh!
42636,"I knew when we were married, this would come between us one day. I don't want to lose what we have, so I'll pay him gladly."
42637,"Ah! Dragonsreach! There are many difficulties, but I cannot think of a better plan."
42638,I've been in the Legion all my life. I'm content to serve.
42639,Never!
42640,"Why delay? Please, take your seat so we can begin."
42642,This place is getting worse and worse.
42643,"Sure I am. We get some furs and tree branches, paint them white, and then tie them to Stump. Instant Frostbite Spider!"
42645,Uggh...
42647,It's Joric. I fear his condition is worse.
42648,"I've got a little work if you're interested, traveler."
42649,"What? After all this, I can't even see him? "
42651,Hmm? Does someone live among the dead?
42652,"Master, I have a question about infusions of arrowroot."
42653,I sense a presence...
42657,My brother keeps trying to spin these fantasies to me about my aunts and our father. He's crazy.
42661,Lookee here. Looks like we got ourselves a hero.
42662,Braith. I.... I've come to tell you that I'm not afraid of you anymore.
42663,"Speak if you must, but mind your tongue. I do not suffer fools gladly."
42664,The glimmer of life is gone...
42667,"My pa runs this town, and you're going to be in big trouble if you mess with me."
42669,Finality.
42671,"They haven't been by the Bunkhouse, but I'm certain they will. How about you?"
42673,Lead the way.
42674,You dare hide from me?
42675,"Hey, get out of here!"
42676,Gone. The living are right to fear the dead.
42678,This is what I've trained for!
42679,"...kill him, he talks to me like that again... ...get him while he's sleeping... ...or poison his meat... ...see how he likes that..."
42680,"...with three beers down, the Orc did frown, and bid the Elf goodbye... ...for none could know, 'twas not for show, and someone had to die... "
42684,"If I wasn't married to Ulfberth, I'd be out of business."
42686,Look at that!
42689,A citizen of Haafingar has been kidnapped.
42690,I won't hold back!
42693,...he he he... two threes? What was he thinking? Fool never saw me pull that ace out of my boot...
42694,"Gods help us, this can't end well."
42695,I really must get back to my duties. This fort isn't going to clean itself.
42696,You... Really? An Elder Scroll?
42698,Oh that's very sweet of you. Anything you can find out from Captain Aldis would be welcome news.
42699,Earned quite a name for myself when I was younger. The Bards College still teaches some of my work to their students.
42700,"This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely."
42701,Get your festival meat pie. Specially made.
42702,"Beirand's my husband. He works the forge up at Castle Dour. I barely see him nowadays, what with him filling orders for the army."
42704,"Froki won't let me hunt on my own yet, but he never shuts up about killing his first stag when he was eleven."
42708,"You could say I'm a King's man at heart. Hmph. I guess that's ""Jarl's man"" now."
42713,I do. So few people possess the taste and sophistication of a proper wardrobe these days.
42714,Nothing here but the mine. Probably best you keep moving.
42718,"Got a good one here involving a shop, a waylaid shipment of goods and an angry client. You fill in the blanks. You want in?"
42720,I love hearing Ogmund sing at the inn. He's a true skald.
42721,I see.
42722,Dismissed.
42723,"Really, I wish my girl would read more. It would certainly keep her out of all those fights."
42724,You'll never get the claw!
42725,"It's not just healing cuts and bruises, you know. The undead are a very real, very dangerous threat and Restoration magics can keep them at bay."
42727,This is not good.
42728,"This is going to end horribly, I just know it."
42729,Your fruit are looking a little less ripe today.
42730,I applaud anyone who assists the court.
42738,"When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either."
42741,"I have my ways, but it's not easy these days."
42742,"She served as a Battle Maiden, using her healing arts to help those that fell on the battlefield. Never even lifted a blade in her life."
42743,I was a student at the Bards College for a short time... until my affiliation with Vaermina was discovered. I haven't been back to Solitude since.
42749,Did you try the grip? Isn't it eerie how it seems to mold itself into your hand?
42750,Our business is done here.
42759,They were smaller back then.
42761,"What I fear, is that the Thalmor will see our victory here and turn greater attention to our shores."
42762,That's all they are... rumors. So quit worrying.
42763,You dirty thief!
42765,"What more could I ask of you? No, you're free to roam. I suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere."
42769,"Expecting free information, eh? Help me deal with business first, then we'll see how I can help you."
42770,I guess all that's left is to bestow the title. What were those words again?
42771,May knowledge of your Divinity carry us through our daily trials.
42772,Gralnach! I told you not to go through your father's things!
42773,Bet I can reach the bottom of this flagon before you!
42775,"Staying safe, I hope?"
42776,"Well, there is something. There's a guard, patrols the road that crazy jester is on. He passes by pretty often."
42779,"I've got weapons for givin', and armor for gettin'!"
42781,"Come on, now! I want those arrows dead center! The lives of your fellow soldiers are counting on it."
42783,I'll keep watch from here.
42784,"Spiced wine, the taste of home and hearth!"
42786,Lightly armored means light on your feet. Smart.
42789,These parties are a great way to earn a little extra money.
42791,Do you think Ancano knew all along what the Eye was capable of?
42792,"Fruit, fresh off the boat! The freshest in Skyrim!"
42793,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
42794,Let's hear it.
42795,Stormblade!
42798,"Well, I guess Margret isn't around to complain. It's yours."
42799,I need you to root them out and drive them away before they find me and drag me back to Hammerfell for an execution.
42802,"We follow, then."
42803,"I've spoken to Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she wishes to speak with both of us."
42804,"But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop."
42805,I've failed you... forgive me...
42806,"Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel call my kind Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel."
42809,"That must have been a hard bit of business. I hear Stentor had been alive for a long, long time."
42810,That's privileged information. Now move along.
42811,Daanik Kendov!
42813,There are wonders in this place I never dreamed imaginable.
42816,I shouldn't be. Everyone wants to ask me about mama and uncle Roggvir.
42817,"Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either."
42818,We'd better push on. The rest of them will have to find another way out.
42819,Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what my Beirand always told me...
42820,Please stay away while you got that spell on you.
42822,"And why wouldn't I be? We sing tales of kings, queens and their politics, 'tis true. But do you know who really makes history?"
42825,Oh... well... of course they'd disavow all knowledge... spies are everywhere.
42827,"If you value your well being, you will offer an apology..."
42828,"So many contracts, so little time..."
42829,"Their aim could be steadier, but they're battle ready."
42830,Please. Remove your naked obscenity from the company of civilized folk.
42831,"No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut up or you'll blow our ambush."
42832,"Perhaps, but necessary. As you know my cousin, Fura, died out there fighting for us. She wouldn't have had to, if it weren't for Roggvir."
42833,"No, no. I'm just a simple herbalist. You'll want to see Arcadia, over in Whiterun."
42834,What do you say?
42837,Skjor... I always thought of him as invincible. 
42839,I'm sure he's learned his lesson. Let's try to enjoy ourselves.
42840,"Oh, well done. Very subtle."
42841,I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.
42843,We're so dead...
42846,Here.
42847,"I hope the wilds claim you, one of these days."
42848,Have you thought about my invitation?
42849,I only brought it to his attention a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it.
42851,You're kinda fuzzy. What's wrong with ya?
42854,Then we understand each other... good.
42856,No. He isn't.
42858,"Let me give you a small bit of advice. Nothing in this line of work is easy. If it was, every dreg in the Ratway would be robbing Riften blind."
42859,"Easy, huh? So, should I just hand you purses of coin or are you going to work to earn your keep?"
42860,Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!
42861,I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
42862,You should ask him about his work. It's the only subject that'll get him talking.
42864,I'm still amazed that your plan worked.
42866,"But, mother... this is quite a sizable contribution and the crime doesn't befit such a harsh punishment."
42867,You are a good friend to have done this. J'zargo will not forget it.
42871,Who knows. Old Delvin thinks it's some kind of a curse. I think he's crazy.
42872,You vanished after drinking the Torpor and materialized on the other side. I have never seen anything quite like it.
42873,"Here, it's all I can spare..."
42874,"And, while you're at it, make a little bit of coin on the side. Not a bad deal, eh?"
42876,"Until a few months ago, the girl was head over heels for Klimmek. Wouldn't stop talking about him."
42877,Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me.
42879,You can get out there and start making a name for us again... make them start fearing us like they did long ago.
42880,"Good to see you, my friend! I knew you'd make a proper Legionnaire."
42882,"You've done a great service for me and my city, Dragonborn."
42884,"Lyin' to my face isn't gonna win you any favors with me, I can promise you that."
42887,No you're not. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
42888,"Press only middle button! Clever trick, yes? Nobody ever thinks of the middle."
42890,"Look around you. The Flagon, the Guild... it's all fallin' apart."
42891,Veren... Thorek... you're alive!
42892,"Somethin' out there is piss-drunk mad at us. I don't know who or what it is, but it's beyond just you and me. We've been cursed."
42893,"Look, I know the others think I'm a bit daft for sayin' stuff like this, but I'm gonna give it to you straight."
42894,Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
42895,That's where you come in. I've got plenty of work available that could guide us down the road to recovery.
42896,"Welcome to the family, lass. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me."
42897,You like Skeever liver. No? Tough luck.
42899,You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way.
42900,Out of my way!
42901,"There's something that's been troubling me, Falk. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must."
42902,"Sir, these are missing commands for about half of the commanders."
42904,"Come on, Tullius. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both."
42905,Your job would be to change the numbers in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit.
42906,"Skyforge Steel is my art and honor. The Companions need the best, so they come to me."
42908,Do the right thing. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
42909,Atub! Meddlesome woman... You would help us? Help me?
42911,"I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean."
42912,Well which is it? Look farther or closer?
42913,They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.
42917,That answer your damn questions? Now get out.
42918,How did you do it?
42920,"Please, stop! I'll pay! Take it!"
42921,"I will not drag my honor through the mud for you, or anyone."
42922,"It's true the Vignar Gray-Mane and his lot are one of Whiterun's oldest and, depending on who you ask, most respected clans. I don't dispute that."
42923,"Ah, a secret admirer, eh? Don't worry, I won't tell a soul."
42926,"Oh, and they hate it, too. All their big talk of pride and honor, and what have they got to show for it? Beggar's rags and stale bread."
42929,"The Gray-Manes have deep roots in Whiterun, but so do we. Difference is, we're rich, and Vignar hates it."
42930,"Money, you laggard! What else? It always comes down to coin."
42932,"Come on, Heimvar. My son could stoke the forge better than you do!"
42934,"Peryite, heed our call if you deem us worthy. Our leader, Orchendor, has led us here and for that we are thankful."
42936,"If we do not please you, give us a sign so that we may understand why."
42939,Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us?
42940,"Well, now. I'm afraid you've caught me a bit out of my element. Most of my time is spent in the Temple of the Divines, you see."
42941,"Yes, a blessing. For many months we have sought your guidance, yet we have heard nothing from you."
42942,"I protect the Jarl, whoever that might be."
42944,"Yes, a sign. We are lost without your guidance."
42947,"I can show you a few things, but anyone asks, and my name never comes up. Understand?"
42948,Never. Now move aside.
42949,Fat Toad 190 is always a crowd-pleaser. Father could probably charge extra.
42950,Keep your eyes and ears open my Brothers and Sisters.  Orchendor needs us to keep vigilant while he convenes with Peryite in the Arcanex.
42952,"Yes, what is it?"
42953,He requests more barrels of ichor to be delivered to the Arcanex tomorrow.
42954,This is the reason you wake me? I already have Orchendor's request taken care of.
42956,"Are you looking for any specific volumes, Drevis?"
42958,I'm sorry my Brother.
42961,"And now, I present to you, Ulfric Stormcloak, hero of the people, liberator and High King of Skyrim!"
42963,Now leave me to my sleep. My strength and patience are waning.
42965,"Well if my layabout manservant fed me more, that wouldn't be a problem."
42966,"Use both words, if you can."
42967,"I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become."
42969,Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of.
42972,He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering.
42973,That's some good armor you've put together.
42974,"Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence."
42976,That may be the case.
42979,Come to get yourself a kid? You're out of luck. No way Grelod will let any of us get adopted. Especially not since Aventus took off.
42981,"Wait, wait. I can see a minor problem in your theory. Without a soul siphon, how would you prevent permanent magicka burn?"
42984,And thank you for your help. You're a good friend.
42985,Seven. Astonishing. I hadn't considered that.
42988,"Wait just a moment. The blue thing. Yes, yes, yes! I can see your point. Draw out the necessary energies using a Jarol Apparatus!"
42989,"Uh, Brelas, sir. Did you need a drink? Something to eat?"
42991,"Genius! And I'm sure you've completely worked out how to counteract complete dimensional collapse, right?"
42993,"Hold on, you've given me a brilliant idea. Just as calipers hold materials in place, a soul siphon can hold magic fields in place."
42994,"Calipers? That's utterly ridiculous. Maybe long ago, you could just find calipers in every household across Tamriel, but not anymore."
42995,"Mallory is an expert ""obtainer of goods."" We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh?"
42996,"There has to be more to it than that, though. I wish I knew where the bees got it from."
42997,Ulfric doesn't care about Talos. He yearns for the throne of Skyrim and he'll say anything to rally people to his side.
42999,"Of course! Nine is the most basic of magical principles. Oh, how stupid of me."
43000,"Now all I need... wait, what were we talking about?"
43002,The only thing Vald understands is gold. A man after my own heart.
43003,"Indeed. And so you have come looking, though you do not know why."
43004,"When my strength returned and he told me about the problems plaguing Riften, I decided fate brought me here for a reason... so I stayed."
43005,"If you want to go to the trouble, feel free. I suppose I could offer you a bit of free Alteration training when you get back."
43010,"Since we share the same opinion of them, let me warn you that they're recruiting others to join their ""guild"" and you should be cautious."
43011,But regrets are pointless. Here we are.
43012,It's going to take more than just myself and Aerin to help this city... it has to want to help itself first.
43013,"Got some fresh-baked bread an' good cheese, if you're after a bite to eat."
43014,I'll tear out your heart first!
43015,"Maybe you haven't heard, but the Thieves Guild is back. Windhelm is their city now, if you catch my meaning..."
43018,"You disappoint me. I expected someone from outside Riften to be different, but I see corruption's reach holds little regard for boundaries."
43019,It speaks the truth.
43021,If you want to know that bad then fine.
43025,May Talos guide you. Always.
43027,"Kill every single member of his band. Do so as silently and invisibly as you can, for this is not about you. You are to be my instrument in this."
43029,"Those who try to hasten the end, may delay it. Those who work to delay the end, may bring it closer."
43030,Unlocking this mystery... The story alone is worth more riches than you can even imagine.
43031,"Oh, yes. J'zargo hopes to find things that will make him a more powerful mage here."
43034,"Not really. Just that it's very, very old. It was one of the first cities of men in Tamriel, I think."
43037,Keep the cold at bay with our spiced wine!
43042,Skuli's father is off fighting for the Stormcloaks. I'm sure he's just fine.
43045,You're telling me.
43046,You look mighty tasty. Better not stick around for supper.
43049,Not now.
43050,Gah. Let's do this already. I'm itching to kill something.
43051,"Forsworn attacks are bad enough, but those sellswords are worse."
43052,Milk drinker.
43060,Someone has to stand up to them. I won't sell.
43062,"Hmm... Blades, helmets. Pretty much anything to suit your needs."
43063,"I shouldn't be. Mama says if I do, people are going to ask about uncle Roggvir."
43066,This isn't about the money.
43067,What's it matter to you? Not like you could do anything about it.
43070,Easy. I'll sell. Just don't hurt anyone.
43073,Of course. Take what you need.
43074,All I need is a messenger to bring Her words to these poor souls by distributing these missives.
43076,Let's do that.
43078,"Gods, no!"
43079,Let's see them make us.
43080,We're ready. 
43081,What have you done? You weren't supposed to murder anyone! Gods...
43083,"That I will, stranger. This is more than the Silver-Bloods are paying us. We'll clear out."
43084,I'm sick of waiting. When are we going to see some action?
43087,"You mean you won't forget about me the moment I'm out of sight? Get yourself a nice old rich husband, have sixteen babies?"
43088,You should speak with my husband. Skaggi runs everything.
43090,"Someone has to keep the silver production running, Betrid, and that means keeping Mulush and Nepos in line once in a while."
43092,I'll search through Sinderion's notes and find some more information about the Crimson Nirnroot and its properties.
43093,Not that it does me any good. Nords think I'm working for the Forsworn. Forsworn think I'm working for the Nords.
43094,You look rather pale. Could be Ataxia. It's quite a problem back home in Cyrodiil.
43096,So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this... we will bow to his wisdom.
43097,And now you have it. No harm done.
43098,Aye. A gift from the Black-Briars after they kicked the previous family out... place called Riftweald Manor.
43099,Get on your way before I change my mind.
43100,"The Thalmor. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning."
43101,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle out in the Pale.
43106,No one here now.
43107,Come back to me if you change your mind.
43108,"Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!"
43110,"Thanks to the White-Gold Concordat, they've been able to operate throughout the Empire with impunity."
43111,I'm in charge of the prisoners here.
43112,Something's happening to bring the dragons back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
43113,No doubt exactly as the Thalmor intended.
43114,"The Nords didn't like the peace treaty much either. Thirty years later, the Empire ends up with the Stormcloak rebellion on its hands."
43115,That's too bad.
43116,Did you reconsider? Will you talk to my father?
43117,There's an Altmer named Nelacar staying at the inn outside the College. You should ask him about it.
43118,I bet we have rabbit again. I'm getting sick of rabbit.
43120,Is she... sifting through trash?
43122,"Now our purpose is clear. I'm all that's left of the Blades, and you're the Dragonborn."
43123,"And then, send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void, in as many pieces as possible."
43125,"No tricks, Karliah or I'll cut you down where you stand."
43126,"Khajiit has wares, if you have coin."
43129,"Make a thrall. Lure him to my shrine. Prove your will is stronger. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice, and then slay him without mercy."
43130,I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always bother me when I'm trying to finish my research?
43131,"As I said, it's easy to find things nobody will miss. My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. You could be too."
43133,"You have to help me, they are going to kill me!"
43137,It's pleasing to see you again.
43143,"Yes, Lady Mjoll. If Riften gets attacked, we'll retreat inside the city gates and bar the door just like you said."
43144,Can't wait to kill another of Ulfric's boys.
43145,"Look, a cave. A fine place to find trouble."
43146,Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?
43150,"Gone? Every one of them? Why, that's incredible."
43152,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
43154,"Very well, here."
43157,But there's no time. Whatever happened here has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make sure everything's all right.
43158,Well? You done or what?
43162,I need you to retrieve the poem.
43166,Well said.
43167,But she was also the best... bringing in more coin a month than some thieves heist in a year.
43170,I'll give you something to cry about if you don't quiet down.
43171,Stick around! Still plenty of songs to sing and mead to drink.
43172,A man goes crazy in the market. Everyone knows he's a Forsworn agent. Guards do nothing. Nothing but clean up the mess.
43173,It feels good to walk the streets of Riften again.
43174,I've been a bit out of sorts since... since our daughter was taken from us.
43175,"Please, let's hurry."
43177,"Whenever I get out of here, I'm going to go kill a Nord."
43180,You'd rather be plowing a field? Not me.
43181,You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed.
43182,"There's a fine line between respect and boot-licking, new blood. But I like your spirit."
43184,An axe of great vengeance. Each fragment is precious.
43186,He made it safe for our kind.
43190,You've come. The draugr infesting Namira's sanctuary are inside.
43191,"If they love me not, how can my love reach them?"
43193,"As I remember things, it was you that showed up at my doorstep looking for a job and a place to live. Try and remember that."
43196,Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy.
43197,I shall guide you unto it. Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward.
43199,Cough Cough
43201,I will feast on you!
43203,Only a fool lets himself get surrounded. Back up and make them come at you one at a time.
43205,"Now go and make us some coin, lad!"
43206,Got somethin' to say?
43207,Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?
43209,"Well, I'm getting to that. Just let me explain."
43214,"Until then, tell the people of Markarth that their dead won't be disturbed, anymore. We have bigger plans ahead."
43215,"It's inside Reachcliff Cave. But the dead have stirred from their slumber recently, and I was forced here."
43216,Tell the people of Markarth that their dead are safe. My work is done here.
43220,"By Sheor, no. Those archaic policies died out with the Mages Guild, and were never enforced here."
43221,You would do that? It's good to know there are some people out there who are willing to help an old man.
43222,Halt. The Dwemer Museum isn't open to anyone without the court wizard's permission.
43225,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
43226,"I'm doing as you asked. Not for nothing, I hope?"
43229,Who are you? Intruder!
43230,Silent means I don't tell and it's none of your business.
43231,Jump! Come on!
43232,"Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known."
43233,I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
43234,Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he is. Now what is it that you want?
43235,"For the man who knows how to make money, war can be a most profitable venture."
43237,"If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for life."
43238,"I'm feeling better, but Bashnag's curse won't wear off for weeks."
43240,"Here, this should help."
43242,"Forgive me, I didn't mean to assume."
43245,You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I suppose you can wait around if you must.
43250,"Oh, but he probably won't do those things to you. Probably. Just remind him to come home, and... there'll be no fighting or unpleasantness. Probably."
43253,On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of Unmelting Snow. No heat can touch it.
43255,Now I have to spend a fortune to keep the whole thing quiet. Guess where that money comes from.
43256,Never much cared for Windhelm. The place is depressing.
43259,"Hey, if you're in good with Maven you've pretty much got it made."
43260,"Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me."
43261,You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.
43262,"Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me."
43265,Look out! The wolf is loose!
43266,You think it'll work?
43271,"So, you in?"
43272,"We strike tonight, at dusk. Be ready."
43273,"Eh? Who's there? Rodulf, that you?"
43274,Good luck out there.
43275,Got into a scrap a few years ago at the Ragged Flagon. Some idiot who stole himself a guard's sword and kept boasting about it.
43276,"You have gathered here night after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly with yourselves."
43277,But which among you truly exceeds the rest?
43278,Without you this would have been a disaster. I should have paid more heed to Varnius' warnings.  I won't make that mistake again.
43279,And please accept this gift from my personal armory.
43280,I have a special task for whichever of you is left standing.
43281,"If I was Maven, I'd blame the Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place."
43283,"If the owner cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the picture... which she can't afford."
43284,The burden of death approaches!
43285,Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb.
43288,This Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.
43289,"Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need off of his corpse... I could care less."
43290,"Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support."
43293,"And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could."
43295,Yeah!
43296,"Well, look at you, thanks. Take it to Voada, she handles all the dogs for the Jarl."
43302,"The Forsworn? Strange. Well, I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future, for what it's worth."
43304,Nicely done. Here's your share.
43305,You're an outsider. You're dangerous-looking. You'll do.
43306,It's no secret that the College's reputation in Skyrim is... tainted.
43308,Found another one of those vents in back near the scaffold.
43309,She hasn't had a chance to look at it yet. Just be careful over there.
43310,Always.
43311,Sweltering in here.
43312,"Allow me to give you her gift... a true blessing to aid you in times of need. Despair not, her warmth will protect you always!"
43313,I don't know. Maybe because it makes the mead taste that much better at night.
43323,We've been awaiting your return.
43325,"Yes, Grelod."
43328,"But the Emperor canceled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed."
43330,She will certainly be missed.
43331,Well I nearly lost my eyebrows to it.
43333,"All right, I'll take a look at it."
43334,"As Mara is my witness, if I didn't have this hood on right now I would spit right in your face..."
43335,Is the new shaft cleared yet?
43337,You're busy. I'll come back later.
43338,The spirit world is strong in this place.
43340,"M'aiq carries two weapons, to be safe. What if one breaks? That would be most unlucky."
43341,"How did you manage to cripple yourself, Degaine?"
43344,"Markarth has changed, but the inn is as lively as ever."
43346,"Yeah, I think I know who you mean. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you."
43347,"How's it coming there, Jawanan?"
43348,Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.
43349,Ha! Found you!
43350,"I've heard the Empire plans to levy a tax on our trading ships. Falk, you've got to do something about this."
43351,Stay alert. Never know when those Stormcloak dogs might charge.
43352,Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there?
43353,"I'm just not up for it, sorry. I'd rather stay here, have a glass of wine, and perform my rites to Arkay in peace."
43354,"There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic. It's very secretive, though, and you know how people hate secrets."
43356,The Arch-Mage.
43358,"I got enough troubles, so don't go adding to them."
43361,"Aye, that I did. I commanded a force of several dozen men, most of them levies from villages in this part of the hold."
43363,Wo meyz wah dii vul junaar?
43364,Nivahriin muz fent siiv nid aaz het.
43365,You do not answer... Must I use this guttural language of yours?
43366,"What? By the gods, Betrid...."
43367,Do you seek to finish that which you could not?
43368,"Please, just go check it out. You'll be saving my life."
43370,"You. You a Dark Elf lover? Get out of our city, you filthy piece of trash."
43372,Cut em down!
43375,"Breeches, gowns... clothes for any occasion, really."
43376,We shout.
43377,Clothes and raiment for the discerning customer.
43378,Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you'll appreciate this...
43379,"Despite your mistakes, I see more potential in you than half the snot-nosed footpads that stumble their way into the Flagon."
43383,"Do not confuse inaction with indifference. Often the wisest course is to wait and watch events unfold, until the time to act is clear."
43385,You found... how in the world...
43386,Good. Take this token of my gratitude.
43387,"Everything I've got on display, really."
43388,Forgive Ugor's harsh words. She is merely doing as she has been told.
43390,You'll be provided all of the power and knowledge befitting a Nightingale.
43391,The dragonstone was a map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
43392,I've been waiting for Roggvir's execution. Talk to me later. 
43393,"Aam? Serve you? ...no. Ni tiid. If and when you defeat Alduin, I will reconsider."
43394,This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants. Return when she has seen her path.
43395,"Oh, a bit of this and a bit of that."
43397,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
43400,Beautiful things for beautiful people.
43401,"If you must know, I was practicing in the yard when the guard I was sparring with feinted when I specifically told him to duck!"
43402,"Let's sate that appetite, hmm?"
43404,Good job!
43405,Now he's dead and gone and the Skyforge of Jorrvaskr lies cold.
43407,I give special rates to members of the Thieves Guild. Show me what you've got.
43410,Think you can take me?
43411,Oh. Of course.
43413,Why don't you take a look at some of my merchandise and we'll see what kind of a deal we can make.
43414,You've done it! That's all of them!
43415,Chops and steaks fit for a jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
43416,"Looking to protect yourself, or deal some damage?"
43417,All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities?
43418,He thinks we've been cursed. But we've been blessed. How can something that gives this kind of prowess be a curse?
43419,I must have forgotten. I'll take care of it tomorrow.
43420,"Don't mistake my political beliefs as a substitute for my family values. They're still my parents, and I love them dearly."
43421,"What I need is my Dwemer Stirring Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately."
43424,"If you're looking for potions you should talk to my aunt, Angeline Morrard."
43425,"No, I want to take my time with it."
43426,We want compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
43429,We've failed. The city is lost. They're through the gates and will be here soon.
43430,You there! What are you doing?
43432,The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They always make such easy prey.
43439,Well? There must be a way through. Look around.
43440,His perception may be more coherent than ours.
43443,"It is said that the Dark Brotherhood, in recent years, has been in decline. That you lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so?"
43445,Now that's a real man!
43448,You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at our sight.
43449,"But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again."
43450,"Wonderful, dear. Thank you."
43451,"Eorlund, dearest, are you hungry? Would you like me to fix you something?"
43452,"Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lass."
43453,"Yes. Just because you're now a professional assassin, don't think you have to skulk around in the dark like a skeever and stab people."
43455,"Oh really? Well, I'm not going to hold my breath."
43456,"It was a bit difficult to come to the ways of Mara at first, but my fellow priests were kind and quite patient with me."
43457,Hrm.
43458,"Oh, I didn't see you there."
43459,"Of course I'm troubled. I'm on the verge of incredible wealth, but my cowardly work force ran at the first sign of danger."
43462,Let's keep moving. That thing is still out there.
43464,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
43465,"Before we wage war upon our foes, we must wage a war against our lesser selves. Cleave to your higher voice and with it shatter your foes."
43466,What do you think?
43467,The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!
43469,"Well, you'd better go pick it up then, before someone snatches it."
43470,"Legend says this tomb holds a treasure that bestows great power on the one who discovers it. Beyond that, not much more is known."
43471,"Please, do you have a potion you can spare?"
43472,"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Wolf pelts."
43473,"Obviously, this treasure will fetch a good deal of gold, and I'm willing to let you share in the reward when we find it."
43474,My Voice has been silent for too long!
43476,"Magic is shunned by most. If it can't be swung over your head and used to crack skulls, most Nords want nothing to do with it."
43477,"Bear in mind, even if you clear out the tomb, you'll still need a key to get to the treasure. A key I happen to possess."
43479,Got one all saddled and ready to go. What are you willing to pay?
43480,"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right."
43482,You're not going to get richer with that attitude.
43483,I'm not done yet...
43486,The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.
43487,"Fancy yourself an alchemist, hmm? Never could get the hang of that."
43489,You know I did.
43491,Are you attempting to threaten me? After I've been so hospitable?
43492,Come on!
43494,"The answer is no, I tell you! Now stop pestering me with your war-mongering!"
43495,Don't suppose there is. But you don't have to be so damned prickly.
43496,Thanks!
43497,"Shor's beard, boy! You forget where you're standing? What kind o' business we're running?"
43499,"And now, to deliver a speech."
43500,Oh. Okay. So we should try to... what? Capture it?
43501,"Listen, father. I've been thinking...."
43502,But I at least will negotiate in good faith.
43504,"Big lizards? By Shor, your mother gave birth to a half-wit. That is the end of this discussion."
43508,"I... I'm not sure. I think perhaps, but I don't know what it is."
43512,Look! Up on the wall. A wizard!
43513,"Perfect, my dear. Absolutely perfect. I'll see you then."
43515,Fie. We beseech you. Darken this gem so that we may use its power to restore The Order of the Black Worm.
43518,"Nonsense. That's just an excuse for you to avoid working, and ""commune with the greenwood like our fathers of old"" and blah blah."
43519,Good day.
43520,"This! This... Orb. The Eye of Magnus, whatever you want to call it. It's clearly powerful, and no doubt they want it for themselves!"
43521,That's what you always say.
43524,"Absolutely. When we say ""walk with the shadows,"" we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us."
43526,What in the name of the gods are you doing?
43527,And what might you be looking at?
43528,There's pirates and then there's the crew of the Red Wave. They're in a class by themselves.
43529,"No handouts today, Brenuin. Now scat. You'll scare off my paying customers."
43530,"No, no! Don't do that. No need to do that. I'm going. See? I'm leaving. No guards, please."
43533,Aren't you already running a job for Farkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
43534,"Why do you tolerate him, mother? All he contributes to this family is embarrassment and disgrace."
43535,Ha! Four more geldings sold. Sound like good news to you?
43536,"Word certainly travels fast, doesn't it?"
43537,Indeed.
43538,"If you do good works for the people and purchase a home from my steward, I'll name you my Thane."
43540,"Aye, mum. That we will. Mares, stallions, donkeys - I don't think it matters. Pretty sure I can sell any steeds we get. "
43541,Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.
43544,"I'll make this very simple for you. All my trades are final. Onmund knew this ahead of time, and went through with it anyway."
43546,Three weeks? You're mad! You can't keep the stand closed for that long!
43548,"Ah, of course! How much have you got?"
43549,Hmm. As you say.
43552,The Blackblood Marauders have been plundering ships off the coast. A lot of people been hurt by their foolishness.
43554,"It's been two months, and no word from father."
43556,"Don't worry, brother. I'm sure he's fine. We've waited longer before receiving a letter."
43557,"Might be worth riding out to Solitude, see if a messenger ship's come in."
43558,"If it'll put your mind at ease, then I agree. But not now, all right? We need the business from the stand."
43563,What are you gonna do if I don't? Huh? Gonna cry to your papa?
43565,"You'd better give me five septims, right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose..."
43566,Death comes for you now!
43569,"Don't make me laugh, baby Battle-Born. You'll be afraid of me till the day I kill you."
43570,You... You're wrong! You can't hurt me anymore...
43571,Drennen!
43575,"Hmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably be an easy kill. Just be discreet - alerting others will be the real threat."
43576,I can't believe any of this is happening!
43577,"So I'm, uh... writing a song for you..."
43578,Time to find another job.
43580,Hey! Hands off!
43581,"Why Jon Battle-Born. You're writing me a song? Does it somehow involve blood, or beheadings, or the honor of my forebears?"
43582,"A ballad? Oh, now I know you're joking with me."
43583,"It's all true, I swear it. You can hear it when it's done. I'll just need a year or two smooth the rough edges."
43584,So have you spoken to that man from the Bards College?
43585,"No, not yet. But I will. I just haven't... gotten around to it yet."
43586,I'm on my way to Solitude to join the Legion. A united Empire is better for everyone.
43587,Whoa. Wait a second. I was just kidding. We'll leave. We'll leave!
43588,Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while you're away.
43589,I've written some letters and placed them in a satchel. Perhaps you wouldn't mind delivering it to them on my behalf?
43593,Harlot.
43595,"I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my family is starting to suspect something."
43599,"How did you... you reach beyond your station, new blood. Let's wait and see how we judge your Trial before speaking further."
43600,"After what you just experienced, you are not amazed? I am at a loss for words."
43602,I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me if you don't....
43603,We've got to find Thorald quickly!
43604,But tomorrow. Definitely.
43605,"Don't talk about my father like that, Jon. And the answer's still no."
43606,You come all this way just to hurt me a second time? Get out of my sight!
43607,You have no choice. You must complete your contract. You must kill me.
43609,"If you can travel there, and retrieve our young Sybil, your transgression will be forgiven."
43610,"But other than that, everything was business as usual. Now, do you have any other painfully obvious things to say?"
43611,"Olfrid, patron of the great Clan Battle-Born, a name I'm sure you know well."
43612,"Brand-Shei, did you hear about Helgen? It's... it's gone! A dragon burned it to the ground!"
43613,You ain't made me that stew in a long time.
43614,"Which, the mutton or the vegetable?"
43616,Mutton.
43617,"Pretty simple. Break into a house, grab a specific item and get out before they realize what's going on."
43619,"Hmm. So I haven't. All right, I'll buy the ingredients tomorrow and we can have it for dinner."
43620,"Ah, yes. No fat on this one!"
43623,There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.
43625,"Old man, without me, you would have withered away a long time ago."
43626,There's a difference?
43627,"I'm no one special, just a miner who swings a pickaxe for his drinking money."
43628,"Papa, I want to talk to you..."
43629,"Fall back, fall back! Regroup and fall back!"
43630,It's good to see the Blades fighting alongside the Dragonborn once again. To think we're treading in the footsteps of thousands of years past.
43631,Whether you are the only Dragonborn of this age... that is not ours to know.
43632,"You'll never defeat the Empire, and you know it. But you're willing to sacrifice thousands for your own selfish ambition."
43633,"Listen, Braith... Why don't you talk to your mother about this, okay? There's a good girl."
43634,Mother?
43635,A god? Assuredly not! Gods are weak and ineffectual. When was the last time you heard or saw evidence of the Aedra in the world?
43637,I can't believe you came for me!
43641,What's going on? What happened in there?
43643,I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.
43644,I wanted to ask you something. It's about a boy...
43645,"Not now, Braith."
43646,"If you ever need something, especially something hard to come by, let me know."
43648,But...
43651,Yeah. Right.
43653,"Now, now... no need for weapons."
43655,If only this parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol. Any idea what that might be?
43657,I can't believe she dragged me all the way to this snowball. I'd rather be broke in Cyrodiil than broke here.
43658,Aringoth sold Goldenglow? What's that idiot thinking?
43659,How unfortunate she has to dig through refuse like that. Someone should give her a piece of bread.
43660,Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you can use it?
43662,This man is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
43665,I appreciate it.
43667,I can't believe we lost Markarth. Igmund's family has ruled there for generations.
43671,"Eorlund and I... we both miss our son terribly. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials."
43672,"You're not in here for life, like I am."
43673,"I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow me to get away with this, but I had little choice."
43674,"But the dragons are the most fearsome. Lucky for us, they don't seem to hunt along the roads."
43676,I don't believe you. That's not your way.
43677,"No... No, as tempting as it is, it won't do to have both sides angry at us."
43679,Not a day passes that I don't wonder if life would be better in Morrowind.
43680,You'll beg me to kill you before I'm done!
43683,That could have turned out better.
43684,"Soul gems are the subject, friend. They're used in enchanting, then they break. Except one."
43688,Hold still...
43689,So why did he sell this place? I mean look at it. This is how to live.
43691,"I'm in charge of Left Hand Mine. You cause trouble, you answer to me."
43693,"Hello, captain! Can you spare a moment? I heard something the other day that I wanted to share with you."
43694,Come on!
43697,"If you'd allow me to indulge myself for a moment, I thought I might make a few observations..."
43699,Probably got drunk and fell into the lake. Who cares.
43701,You're the one Mazzaka described to me.
43704,It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.
43709,"Well, you could always speak to Delvin or Vex if you're looking for extra work."
43710,"Mercer's been here, I hope we aren't too late."
43711,It's appreciated. The captains around here will have one less thing to worry about. Here's your reward.
43712,"Ah, now that is a good question. Where does Hogni get the finest, freshest meat from all over the Reach?"
43713,"The Dominion is here, and we're watching you."
43716,"Unscrupulous daring. It's why you fell in love with me, my dear."
43717,I've dreamed of seeing Eldergleam for years. Might I travel alongside you? I promise not to get in the way.
43723,What? Who... what do you want then?
43724,You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you. You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility.
43726,"You might be able to learn something from it. Keep looking, but be careful."
43727,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
43728,"Ah yes, you were with us at Helgen."
43729,"You could get some useful information about whatever they were up to. Sounds like it won't be of use to them now, anyway."
43730,"All right, let's give this a try. Ready your ward..."
43738,My parents keep a close eye on the miners. They can't be trusted too much.
43739,"Excuse my disorganization, but I'm in the middle of some delicate experiments."
43741,"It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything!"
43745,"Namira watch over you, champion."
43746,"Think of this as the fire builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What will you burn? What will you spare?"
43748,"I don't think Galmar even knows my name. Probably because I'm not ""The Dragonborn."""
43749,It's all been for nothing.
43750,And just why would you be doing that?
43752,"It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't listen. ""No, it won't be too cold"" he said."
43753,I can't decide if things are about to get worse or better.
43755,"Can't believe Ulfric's gone. If not for Hermir, I'd have left the city by now."
43760,That is so.
43761,"I've been meaning to speak to you, Niranye. Rumor is, you've got ties to the Thieves' Guild."
43764,"I might well ask the same of you, running around by yourself in this dangerous place."
43766,Not without a fight it isn't!
43767,That's the battle you need to fight. Not this. This will be suicide. And to what end?
43768,What is that supposed to mean?
43769,"Now. We really must be going, sir."
43771,"Come. You, too. We can escape through the tunnels."
43775,Forgive me if I don't appear relieved... this temple has taken its toll on me.
43776,Yes. The Skull has been destroyed and Dawnstar is safe.
43777,Got a good one here. Personal score to settle between myself and this mark. You up for it?
43779,I'm paid to wait to take you home. Enjoy yourself.
43782,My turn!
43783,How can I argue with that?
43784,"Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid."
43785,I do!
43786,"I miss the days when the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns got along. Ever since the war started, we've been at each others' throats."
43787,We will prevail!
43789,Look out! The prisoners are loose!
43790,I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Winterhold.
43791,"All the Argonians at the docks are nice to me. Good thing, too, or father would run them off!"
43794,"Wonderful. Please follow me, and don't wander off."
43797,The dead exist to feed the living.
43798,"If you love history, you're in the right place. Skyrim is steeped in it."
43799,"Oh, my aching head. Why do I do this to myself?"
43800,"Magic. That's what they always want. Never history. Never the secrets of the lost races. No, just little spells and enchantments."
43801,You what?
43803,"Not many would walk blindly into a crypt, smelling of steel and blood, but not fear."
43804,It's just this way. Keep following me.
43805,I feel the hunger inside of you. Gnawing at you. You see the dead and your mouth grows wet. Your stomach growls.
43808,"Protect us, Arkay, from the foul and unclean who seek to disturb the dead's rest."
43809,"When you come to your senses, find me there and we'll discuss your future."
43810,Arkay will guard our eternal rest. His servants shall protect the dead from harm.
43811,"Yes, an unfortunate turn of events, that. But an isolated incident. And I have been assured that the fault was with the man's son alone."
43815,"Well, like I told Delvin, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process."
43817,"Exactly. One of the pieces stolen from her was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back."
43821,This... isn't over...
43822,"It pains me to see this locket... to be reminded of  Fjotli once more, but I'm glad it's back where it belongs."
43824,I can't believe I'm still alive.
43825,"Don't know what that was, but don't try it again."
43829,You'll be the toast of Whiterun for this!
43831,"Elisif, are you really going to be a party to this foolishness?"
43832,When will Sanuarach Mine be open?
43835,I fear for what this change will do to my family.
43838,"Or at least, I thought I was. I don't really know what I'm doing."
43841,"Oh, this was thousands of years ago, before the Akaviri crusaders cleansed Skyrim of dragons."
43845,"You could trap him there, exactly."
43846,Old Nord folk tales always talk about Shouting their enemies to pieces. I always thought it was just a myth.
43848,"Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor."
43849,"The Jarl's palace in Whiterun? Ah, yes... the old story about King Olaf's pet dragon. Ingenious!"
43850,I am not the person that the people of Whiterun think I am. My real name is Iman. I am a noble of House Suda in Hammerfell.
43852,"Put that thing away, or get out."
43853,Who are you? Where's Gavros?
43854,Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in Solitude.
43855,"I wasn't born in Skyrim, but when I served in the Legion this land became my home."
43857,Dragonborn? What do you know about the Dragonborn?
43858,I'm setting him up with a new identity. It's the only way to throw the guard permanently off his trail.
43859,I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...
43860,Your kind has no place here!
43865,I'm afraid there's a further problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
43869,"I had a look at that boneyard the other day, Vantus. The one to the Northwest."
43870,"When possible, we ask applicants to perform tasks the college needs completed. In this case, I do have a task befitting an aspiring bard..."
43871,"Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him."
43872,"The city guard in Solitude is seeking Arn for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine?"
43875,She might find something good in there. One man's trash is another's treasure.
43877,"If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional."
43878,"I mean, the Redguards fought off the Aldmeri and the Empire, and now Hammerfell is an independent state. That's all we Nords want for Skyrim!"
43880,I have eyes within Dragonsreach. They tell me that all correspondence from other holds are sent to the Jarl's private chambers.
43881,Zu'u ni tahrodiis. It was you that lured me here and took me prisoner... vobalaan grahmindol. I have done nothing to earn your distrust.
43883,My sources tell me you can find that book in a study in his quarters.
43884,It's a well-known fact that the steward keeps all of the records on Whiterun's prisoners in a large book.
43885,Tell Delvin that he has my support and all the weight it carries in Whiterun from now on. I think he'll be quite pleased.
43887,Are you kidding me? We're all alone out here except for a few guards who couldn't give a damn about us.
43890,Arn? Never heard of him.
43891,We'd better find out what's happened.
43893,Passably. Aia is my star pupil. None of the others can hold a candle to her. Especially not that wretched llldi.
43894,"Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done."
43895,It's about time you got here.
43898,That's more like it.
43899,Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time.
43901,"Once you get your hands on it, I want you to plant it in Captain Volf's footlocker. I'll take care of the rest."
43903,"So, he says to petition Malacath for relief? Interesting."
43904,"But it's more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt that it actually exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not sure."
43905,Now get going... I don't want to see your face until the job's done.
43906,Captain Volf is ashore right now and I want the authorities waiting for him when he gets back.
43907,"Oh, convey my compliments to Delvin for me. Tell him I'll be happy to reopen whatever doors he needs in Solitude."
43909,Our contract is complete. Here's a token of my gratitude for your efforts.
43910,"Yes, I know. In fact, by now, Captain Volf should be on his way to the prisons."
43911, 
43912, 
43913,Are you sure?
43916,"Get back! Get back! We need to trap it, not kill it!"
43918,"I'm almost certain he'll reach the Imperial City tomorrow, so we should have an answer by the end of the week."
43920,"Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, more so than when we took that wagon. But if we work together, we can pull this off."
43921,They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years! 
43923,Say no more. I was wondering what you were doing here... I'm glad to play my part.
43924,Let's get this over with.
43925,The idiots in Falkreath still think the best place for prisoners is that hole in the ground.
43926,Look out! Draugr!
43928,Consider me your new friend in the north.
43929,Here we are. Dawnstar. Capital of the Pale. Don't get up this way much. Beautiful country though.
43933,Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These terms are still not acceptable.
43935,Nivenor is my wife. How I was ever able to meet such a gorgeous creature is one of life's mysteries.
43937,"First off, seems the Jarl's Steward might be vulnerable to blackmail. Need to investigate that possibility."
43939,"As my Thane, I'm sworn to your service. I'll guard you, and all you own, with my life."
43941,Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck!
43942,Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.
43944,"If you confront her with three of the Marks, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do!"
43947,To feed my power when I come for you in Sovngarde!
43950,I love you.
43952,We take our leave.
43954,"I've got enough to worry about, taking care of my family. I don't concern myself with such matters."
43955,You know the old man doesn't like it. 
43956,"New in town, huh? Whiterun's got two clans, both old and both respected."
43958,What happened after was my fault. All mine.
43959,Wait...
43960,The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of...
43961,Prepare to die!
43965,"No thanks to you, Casimir."
43966,"I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, Priest of Mara."
43967,You're a traitor. You left us to die and then ran before the Miasma took you.
43968,No. I... I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.
43969,"Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til. I surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is marshalled there."
43970,Enough of your lies!
43971,"Watch your tongue, stranger. We don't take backtalk in this inn."
43972,"You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have you hauled away."
43974,I long to taste battle again.
43975,"I can't stand them, they represent everything I hate about Skyrim. They're tearing the place apart!"
43977,"I pray you're right, Legate."
43978,"We don't sell any imports from Summerset Isle, do we, Lucan?"
43979,"You don't remember me, Hjalti? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again."
43980,"Well, I never claimed otherwise."
43982,"Fruits and vegetables, all ripe and ready for your table!"
43985,"On your way, then."
43986,"Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will not speak? To anyone!"
43987,"You have the ability, but you need to learn discpline if you wish to fulfill your potential."
43988,I promise a swift but painful end!
43990,I'll see you there.
43991,Your presence will be revealed.
43992,"Many years ago I lost my blade, ""Grimsever,"" within a Dwemer ruin. I took it as a sign that I was wasting my days in search of wealth."
43993,"Endon's mold? I'm afraid you have the wrong place, my friend. You'll find no silversmiths here."
43994,You learn a new word like a master... you truly do have the gift.
43997,"Okay, well... I guess it's possible. I've been selling my sword arm for years now. Killed a lot of people. Could be someone wanted revenge."
44000,Enough of this!
44005,Something is creating an incredible amount of interference.
44006,Don't do that.
44011,"The Wheelstone? Have you decided to sell it, yet?"
44013,"So you have, mortal. Go now. Kill Orchendor."
44016,"Well, it never arrived. Later I found out that it was robbed by a group of bandits led by someone named Rigel Strong-Arm."
44017,Several months ago I ordered a special silver mold from some artisans in Valenwood by way of a Khajiit Caravan.
44018,I was sure I heard something.
44019,I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there.
44022,Yes. It's an altar. Men would come and sacrifice the wretched in my name. The weak would be punished by the strong.
44026,"Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild."
44028,"Yes, indeed. The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch."
44032,I think you'd be a little smarter than that.
44033,As you wish.
44034,"Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities."
44036,You used to love finding new places.
44037,It's at the south end near that loose rockpile.
44039,"I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you."
44041,Here. I hope you choke on it.
44044,Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth.
44047,I guess we're lucky that didn't come down on top of us.
44048,"That's it. Now, let's get out of here."
44049,You should. I miss you. 
44051,"A guest, oh my!"
44053,"... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it."
44055,"What are you in for, new blood?"
44056,"Well, I'll try to be a good influence, then."
44057,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
44058,She hardly mentions anything else. 
44061,"Chin up, Ungrien! Remember, you have a roof over your head and food in your belly thanks to the very same Dark Elves. Be thankful."
44063,"Now, now! That won't be necessary."
44064,"You think you know pain? Do you!? Try watching your wife and daughter burn alive after they've been ravaged by brigands! That's pain, my friend."
44065,I wouldn't worry about that. He's a good elf. I trust him.
44066,Don't stop. Keep cutting.
44067,You're probably right.
44068,"Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage too, I see, so that's done."
44069,"All right. What next, then?"
44072,Death feeds new life.
44074,By the gods! Somebody help me!
44075,Indeed.
44077,"Yes, my son, what is it I can help with?"
44078,Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!
44079,For Skyrim!
44080,I hope the tome we need is still intact.
44081,The Forsworn ambush our roads and dragons cloud the skies. Is there any good news?
44083,"You worry too much, brother. Victory will be ours."
44084,"You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, ""Dah,"" which means ""Push."""
44085,"With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use it wisely."
44086,We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout.
44089,"No, no. Mostly, I'm just a simple herbalist. Lami over in Morthal should be able to help you."
44091,Ha! We'll see about that!
44092,"Hello there, friend. Have you come to enjoy the sights and sounds of this beautiful sanctuary, as I have? Truly remarkable, isn't it?"
44094,You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!
44095,"In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance."
44097,"You're a well-traveled sort, I can tell just looking at you."
44098,Last I heard he intended to pass through Eastmarch on his way here.
44100,Ah. Thank you! Excellent. Now... where were we?
44102,"Then go back to your boss and tell him what I've already told him so many times, I lose count."
44104,I know you're up there. Go get the treasure. Doesn't it look pretty?
44105,Get ready for a fight.
44108,Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.
44109,I'll send word to the strongholds to let you in as one of our own. 
44110,Arkay. One of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death.
44117,"It's somewhere around here, Agna said to look to the Bear to find the way."
44119,Oh? What about it?
44122,"I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to her! To the Listener!"
44124,"I'll have to take your word on that one, my dear."
44127,"I hope we will speak again soon, marsh-friend."
44129,As long as you don't mind going axe-to-axe with a bunch of Daedra-worshipping savages who practice the dark arts.
44131,I think I like the lake here just a little more.
44132,But mama...
44134,Ha! Like the bite of a flea!
44136,Let's just take a look then.
44137,Locked. Damn! One of the hags nearby will have the key. You'll have to take it from here. I'll keep watch here - unless you can pick the lock.
44138,Oh my... that's the worst one yet. How about we stop talking and keep our eyes open like Gulum-Ei said?
44140,"If that weapon breaks anything of mine, I'll break something of yours."
44141,"But, I need that money! I earned it."
44142,"Ha ha! Oh, I knew I had a good feeling about you!"
44143,Fresh fruit and vegetables for sale!
44145,"Damn it, man, are you trying to taunt us? "
44146,What kind of filthy barbarian just throws their trash on the ground?
44147,"Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what we're all about."
44148,"Petra! Evil Petra put me here, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat."
44149,"Hmm, yes. I have been pondering on exactly that question. Lingrah morah."
44150,"We are bonded now, you and I. Joined, through the powers of the Void."
44151,The first thing we need to do is figure out who's behind the dragons.
44153,"If we take care of him, the way should be clear to properly assault the island."
44154,"I present the two of you with these matching rings, blessed by Mara's divine grace. May they protect each of you in your new life together."
44155,Oh. Yes. You all look the same.
44157,"Live in my tower, roost in my home. Mix pretty poisons and collect shiny eyeballs, yes."
44158,"Please, there isn't much time. What is it?"
44159,"For an alchemist like myself, it is the most pure expression of my art. To create from nothingness is... poetry."
44161,What? That flower-chewer's died? Then let me out. My tower!
44162,You can't threaten me any worse than they have!
44163,I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is away as a joke.
44165,"Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open."
44167,What? No! Get back in your cage!
44169,What? How did you get this far?
44170,I hope there's more bandits around... their numbers could use a little more thinning.
44171,You get used to it after a while... kind of smells like the hot springs out in the tundra.
44172,"Work needs doing, and if you're not up to it, maybe you're not cut out to be a Companion."
44173,By the gods... you! But it can't be. You're dead. You... Yeaaaahhhh!
44177,"Thongvor, I have the latest reports from Cidhna Mine and the smelter. We should go over them immediately."
44178,"Damn shame, Roggvir. You were a good man."
44181,There you are.
44182,"You're welcome to look around, of course, but understand that this place belongs to me."
44183,I can't stop you if that's what you want to do. Hircine is too powerful.
44184,"That's right! Don't worry, Uncle Ralof, I won't let those soldiers sneak up on you."
44187,Now you see why I've warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!
44193,"Keep walkin', softgut. I'm more woman than you can handle."
44195,You hear about the Shatter-shield girl? It's a tragedy.
44196,So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you.
44199,I knew the Greybeards would send you for the horn if they thought you were Dragonborn.
44203,"Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of mortals, their crafts and their hearts."
44204,We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things.
44205,"After all, repentance is something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called justice."
44206,I think you might be looking for Enmon. 
44207,"Do your worst, monster!"
44209,Listen to your inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into doing something you will later regret.
44210,I wonder if the College's reptuation will ever recover from our adventures.
44211,"I trust that you will make the right choice, in the end. Listen to the Voice that Kynareth has placed within you, and your path will be clear."
44215,"Speak, and then begone."
44216,"You have made your choice, Dragonborn. You are not welcome here."
44218,We have nothing to talk about until Paarthurnax is dead.
44219,"Travel southeast and you'll find an Orc stronghold, up around the old Dushnikh orichalcum mine."
44221,Die Imperial!
44223,Why? Who says I have to be?
44227,"My oath binds me, Dragonborn. Until Paarthurnax is dead, you aren't welcome here."
44228,Pay your dues and we'll speak.
44231,"As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow. Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn his place back at my side."
44232,A mindless vendetta urged on you by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians!
44236,"All you need to know is that the Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above the law."
44240,"That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks."
44241,I merely wish to talk to you.
44242,"You're not short of guts, are you? What's your game?"
44243,"Ah, good to see you again! How did that delivery go?"
44245,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
44247,"I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief."
44250,"In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!"
44255,Still you persist? Very well.
44256,"Nevertheless, my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do so."
44257,"I'm all too aware that my arrival has aroused suspicion, especially in Ancano, your Thalmor associate."
44258,We Orc men are not like these Nords and Imperials who carry on until they are grey and feeble and their hair falls out.
44260,Outlanders should learn to not wander where they don't belong.
44265,"As you may have learned, this object... The Eye... is immensely powerful."
44266,"It's very nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse Orthus here. He so rarely gets back to civilization. Stuck in Windhelm, poor fellow."
44269,Perhaps I'll ask Tolfdir what really happened. I understand he was here at the time.
44270,No. Not again. Help!
44273,You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Riften on these terms.
44274,"Here's the best part. They took me as a prize, and violated me for a fortnight. Tossed me from bandit to bandit like... like..."
44275,I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order?
44276,"I am sorry I cannot provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a great deal of effort on my part."
44278,It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.
44279,"Now, I am afraid I must leave you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we can."
44282,Its sweetness is like a fair maiden's kiss on a starry night. And it's got enough kick to put a frost troll on his hind quarters! Ha!
44285,She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.
44287,Look sharp. There they are. In the window!
44288,"Lillith - always a pleasure. Just browsing, or were you looking for something particular?"
44289,They're up on that wall.
44290,"And of course, we couldn't have done it without you."
44292,"I saw you do that, you know."
44293,"This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all their accumulated dragonlore."
44294,"I'm afraid I had to pay off a few officials to keep you out of jail, boss. Expensive to get murder off the books, know what I mean?"
44295,I knew you could be counted on. Do what must be done.
44297,Seemed like the best way to see the world and make some coin.
44298,By that rock over there. See 'em?
44302,But I will heed your wishes.
44304,You're back from Bleak Falls. Did you find anything?
44306,Hmm? What about?
44308,I think so. Just hold on a moment.
44310,Here they come!
44311,This is hopeless! Retreat!
44313,"When Dengeir's health began to fail, young Sidgeir was appointed Jarl in his stead. It was simpler just to keep me as steward."
44317,"The Mage Light spell is useful to any mage, not just those specializing in Alteration. Can you cast one on the seal on the ground?"
44319,Morthal is full of cowards! Let's go kill that monster.
44320,"We were taking him to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine."
44321,A pox on the Empire!
44323,"Look, I told the client you probably had a good reason to kill the mark, but well, they demanded reparations."
44324,For the glory of the Empire!
44326,Send Ulfric my regards!
44327,"Alduin's Wall... one of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy."
44328,Die rebel!
44329,Ysmir's beard! She's...she's a vampire!
44330,Good hunting.
44331,"I'll ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may be working on research or... delicate experiments."
44333,"I thought they were taking us south to Cyrodiil. Parade us in front of the Emperor. But then we stopped in Helgen, and you know the rest."
44335,What? Well - what did she say?
44340,A parent should never outlive a child. Having my daughter's spirit here... it's as if she never died.
44344,"And come back with a barrel full of gold, hmm?"
44346,"Hmph. All right, then. Go. Go, my Listener. Find out what that slimy bastard Motierre has to say, then send the Emperor to Sithis."
44347,The man doing your job?
44348,"Babette, my girl - pack your things. We're moving."
44349,"Yes, child?"
44350,Aggh! 
44354,"Well I'll be damned. We heard you were dead. Motierre's in the back room, if you've got business. "
44355,Mother wants me to work at the mill. But I ain't nobody's slave.
44358,"In any event, here's my advice. Go to Riften's Ratway, find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before, no?"
44359,You should be more careful about the women you spend time with in port. Come back later and it will be ready.
44361,"You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically... intervene directly in events."
44363,You've no right to be here. This place is for Orcs. And Orcs alone.
44364,"Don't worry. I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you trust me."
44365,Malacath blesses us with this land. It's not for your kind.
44366,Twilight guide your path.
44367,"Take it easy, father. You're making a scene."
44369,What then?
44370,"Yes, and we have something special for you this time."
44371,"He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration. He's... Well, he's very particular about who shares the knowledge."
44373,"Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman."
44374,"Few outsiders earn the right to enter our strongholds. Speak with more respect, or we might forget your gifts."
44376,What's the bloody hold up in there? How long can it take to run through a few scraggly assassins?
44378,I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to suspect who I am.
44379,"And so ends the Dark Brotherhood, once and for all. About bloody time."
44380,You got me.
44381,So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover the dragonstone for me.
44383,"Yeah, that was a shame."
44384,"And when the elves marched into your beloved Cyrodiil, and everyone took up arms against them, wasn't that treason? Against the Dominion? Huh? "
44386,Damn. No way to open this from our side.
44389,Get out of my sight.
44390,"I don't suppose I could convince you to take care of it now, could I?"
44391,Only if I can help it.
44393, 
44394,You should leave. Now.
44395,Get away from me. Liar!
44397,I never would have dreamed I would be getting married in the Temple of Mara.
44398,This ceremony is so different from an Orc marriage. Less blood.
44399,Whatever you say!
44401,"Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!"
44403,"""Forgiveness is the heart of Mara's blessings."" Very well. We shall re-arrange your wedding."
44404,He needs to die. He deserves to die. And it falls to you to kill him.
44405,You won't get the best of me!
44415,We're mounting our attack on Markarth. Get over there and join the brothers gathering for the attack. This is it now! Talos be with you.
44416,You're just going to walk away from your betrothal? Get out of the temple.
44417,"Had I intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
44418,"Ah, here's the proud groom now. Let's begin the ceremony."
44423,"I'm just as puzzled as you, lass."
44424,No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.
44428,Food's hot. Never said it was good.
44434,"Somewhere up north, in the ice fields."
44436,"Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass."
44437,"Those kids are dead anyway. Killing me won't bring them back. I, on the other hand, have done quite a bit with my time on Mundus."
44440,"Well, your classmates certainly seem to disagree with you."
44441,"My honor isn't so cheap, outlander."
44444,"Names have power, lass. You should know by now. Just say ""Velehk Sain, I release you."", and ""Poof!"", I'm on my way."
44446,"Names have power, lad. You should know by now. Just say ""Velehk Sain, I release you."", and ""Poof!"", I'm on my way."
44450,What did you want?
44453,Sosaal fah hin vothaarn.
44454,"Very well, you may approach the Mournful Throne, but watch your words."
44455,"Leigelf is a good man, and I'm not running out on him now."
44456,This looks like the way.
44458,This should work. I've done it before.
44459,"Come on, get up!"
44460,"She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion."
44461,I was sent by Nepos the Nose. The old man hands out the orders.
44464,"But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and nothing's going to stand in our way."
44465,"I used to think so, too."
44466,"Do enjoy your time in Rorikstead. This close to the Reach, well, we are truly blessed to have such fertile ground."
44467,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
44468,No harm done. Tell this Endon fellow I hope he finds what he's looking for.
44471,In fact. Keep it. I must have used up the magic in the staff or something. It's just a dumb stick of wood now. 
44472,"There were three of us. Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were a anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften."
44475,My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through the city.
44477,"What's more, he's got no armor. I'll have to save up the money for it."
44479,I know. The poor girl's fright has left her bereft of reason. But there's no talking her out of it. I fear she'll be locked in there for days.
44481,"You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn."
44483,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
44484,This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to Forsworn attacks. A specially-made Dibella statuette.
44486,It's all in this note.
44487,You can't scare me into submission. Let's go.
44488,And Erikur?
44493,"You're not afraid of me, are you?"
44497,Someday there'll be proof they caused the Great Collapse. Most of a city just dropping off into the sea... That doesn't just happen.
44498,"I can assure you, though, that it was quite something in its prime. An early capital of Skyrim, you know."
44499,I'm afraid the Winterhold you see before you is somewhat... underwhelming.
44503,"Release me, and I'll share a bit of my wealth with you."
44504,I know the prophecy by heart. Once all Blades knew it.
44505,Else you could go see the Jarl's wizard. Might be able to help you.
44506,I'll find you... it's only a matter of time.
44508,"Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle."
44510,"Yes... yes, that's an excellent idea. Who knows what other lost treasures we might discover?"
44513,There is some good news though. I think the borders of the shrine may be smaller than we think.
44516,I'll wait here. Just don't start any trouble without me.
44517,Your end is near!
44518, 
44519,"Quickly, come with me."
44520,You sure? All right. I'll keep guard here.
44521,All right. Don't be long.
44523,Certainly. Be careful.
44524,They're the rulers of the Aldmeri Dominion - what used to be the Imperial provinces of Summerset Isle and Valenwood.
44525,"Oh, my, I hadn't thought of that."
44526,As you wish. Just don't forget about me.
44527,I'll stay here. You try not to get into too much trouble.
44529,We fight till the last!
44530,To the next fight.
44531,"Hello, yes? I'm the Dean of History. And scribe work, when I can find some quiet time."
44532,I will walk alongside you.
44535,Let's get going.
44536,"Yeah, yeah."
44537,"Yes, child?"
44538,The Empire has no place in Skyrim... not any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.
44541,Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens.
44543,"You look like an adventurous one. I bet we're kindred spirits, you and I."
44547,I'm right with you.
44548,"So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well."
44552,I believe Sanguine would be pleased with this festival.
44553,So it wasn't my imagination.
44554,"Please, will you help me get out of here? If the coast is clear, I'll make a break for it."
44556,"So what's the plan, then? How do you intend to lure a dragon into the trap?"
44557,"I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on."
44560,"You're Dragonborn, and you're the only one who can stop Alduin. Don't forget it."
44561,"Very well. Empty the vessels into the sconce near the throne, then sit in the throne."
44563,Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord Hircine.
44564,The arrangement called for a trade. I hope you'll find this suitable.
44565,"You know I can't tell you that. As soon as I do, and you have a few meads in you, everyone will know."
44566,Hmph. Look at you. So calm. So confident. I do believe you were born for this task. So let's begin.
44568,"You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it."
44571,"What's the matter, friend? Khajiit got your tongue? Maybe you need a little ditty to loosen your gob, hmm?"
44572,Who are you? What do you want?
44573,Be careful out there.
44579,"Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind."
44583,"Oh. I'm sorry I said anything, then."
44584,The Greybeards have arranged a truce between the Stormcloaks and Imperials. How long can such a thing last?
44587,Wonderful. Where to begin?
44588,"Yes. If you were ready, of course. Are you familiar with how marriage works in Skyrim?"
44590,"I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it."
44591,"Oh, forgive me, Thane. I didn't realize it was you."
44592,"Thank you, Laila. I wanted to discuss the protection of my shipments."
44593,Don't even want to think about what those cretins did to them before they died.
44596,"I have much to thank you for, little one. When you die I will raise you and you can take your place by my side."
44600,You're not listening to me. I don't have it.
44604,And mine is yours.
44605,I must petition Malacath for relief. This curse must be lifted.
44609,Coward.
44610,"Tell you what. Go along with his plans for now. I'll keep an eye on you both and, when the time is right, I'll settle accounts with Louis."
44611,The misses and I love your strawberry tarts.
44612,"It's under your feet, lass. Just follow the smell."
44613,"You did well here today. I don't think the truce will last long, but that will not be on your account."
44614,Looking for work? I need someone to deliver a message to Sibbi Black-Briar.
44616,Don't forget getting a good pair of gauntlets. Broken hands can't hold a sword.
44619,I do. Now and forever.
44620,"Paaz Keizaal fen kos stin nol bein Alduin jot, Dovahkiin kos fin saviik do muz!"
44621,"Sahrot Thu'um, med aan tuz, vey zeim hokoron pah, ol fin Dovahkiin komeyt ok rein!"
44623,"Your Sanctuary's being put to the sword right now. That's what I think of this ""deal."" You killed my son! All of you! And now you'll pay the price."
44624,But... What of Yamarz?
44625,"Fair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin's maw, Dragonborn be the savior of men!"
44626,I tell Thonar I can only smelt what Nepos and his miners dig up.
44627,"But a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon's lies, will be silenced forever and then!"
44628,"Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world!"
44630,There's an old man. He lives in Riften.
44631,"And the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Tamriel shuddered with war!"
44634,Don't bother with Tacitus. Useless.
44635,Yeah? What is it?
44636,"And the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumph's shout, Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!"
44637,"If he's worried about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it. I'll take the glories of the hunt right here."
44638,Amazing! These must have been very hard to come by.
44640,Dealing with a mob wouldn't be good for my coin purse. Fine. We're leaving.
44643,"There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!"
44647,Wuunferth. There have been rumors swirling about him for years. As long as I can remember.
44648,We'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own. With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.
44649,Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins...
44652,"It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes."
44653,Lucky for you that was just sitting there for the taking.
44654,"Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart."
44655,"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear."
44656,"If Alduin is eternal, then eternity's done. For his story is over and the dragons are... gone."
44658,Good. Perhaps I've misjudged.
44659,"And all heard the music of Alduin's doom. The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um."
44660,"And if Alduin wins, man is gone from this world. Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled."
44661,We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage. Heroes on the field of this new war to wage.
44663,Actually... I do. Little joke.
44666,"You might just make it. But for now, you're still a whelp to us, new blood. So you do what we tell you."
44668,Arugh!
44670,If this is somehow your fault...
44672,Raaarrgh!
44673, 
44675,Excellent work. 
44677,Grragh!
44678,"My men will not attack you, if you will lower your weapons."
44679,Is dinner ready?
44686,Is it really dead?
44688,The Silver Hand. I think you've met them before. 
44689,You've already lost!
44690,That's it then. After all of those years of helplessly watching the Guild decline.
44696,Another thrall for the Void!
44697,The nightmares are an echo of her presence as she feeds.
44698,"So... wait. Cicero is alive? And we're all friends again? I swear, I can hardly keep up..."
44699,"I came here hoping to learn that more Imperial reinforcements were on their way to Skyrim, but so far I've been disappointed."
44700,Grrr!
44703,No...
44705,"We go up, yes? Always up."
44706,"And as for you, I owe you a portion of the reward, don't I?"
44707,Agh!
44708,And now you pay for meddling in the Thalmor's affairs.
44709,Nyargh!
44710,Exactly.
44713,"I know, and I appreciate it dearly. But I can't help but feel we could be doing more..."
44714,"Don't worry, you can return to your petty squabbles and meaningless 'research' as soon as this matter is resolved."
44715,"The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding."
44718,"Much better. Thanks, friend. I wouldn't have lasted much longer without that."
44722,Don't you walk away from me!
44723,I'm the fourth person to work the tasting counter in the last year. The last three are at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
44726,You would shut out the darkness?
44730,Oof!
44731,Ugh!
44732,"Bloodsuckers. Vampires. Take every precaution. One bite, and you could end up as one of them."
44733,In these grave times each Legionnaire must be his better self at all times and under all conditions.
44734,"You can't kill what's already dead, mortal."
44735,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
44736,The honey they collect on that hunk of rock goes into making Black-Briar Mead; just about the best tasting mead in all of Skyrim.
44737,Uhh.. thank you...
44738,"Thank you, my chief."
44740,Aiiiieee!
44742,Aiiiieee!
44744,Well now! That's a shamefully absurd way to go around in public.
44746,Ahhhhh.....
44748,I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
44749,It's time we put a little kink in the Emperor's security.
44751,Yeeeaaahhh!
44752,Father...
44753,"If you're one of the Jarl's men, you'll get your lumber. Anga's Mill pays its debts."
44755,What do you want? There's no words left to say to each other.
44756,"Look at you. Come crawling back, after everything you've done to me?"
44759,There's some trouble in The Pale. We need you to go in and clear out an enemy stronghold.
44761,The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...
44763,He grows more powerful with every soldier slain in your pointless war!
44764,"Finally, both of my mines are open again. Time for everyone to get back to work."
44765,"I can't believe you're speaking to me, after what you've done. You broke my heart."
44766,This way.
44768,"It was you who fought a dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down with it. "
44769,Have you been working on your concentration?
44770,"No, we can only rely on ourselves. You'd do well to remember that."
44771,"Yes, my daughter, what is it I can help with?"
44772,"Try again? You and me? Fine, but I've got my eyes on you."
44773,"You want to try again? Fine, but I'll be watching you carefully."
44777,Leave. Now!
44778,"Don't say that to loud, you don't want it getting back to him."
44779,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
44780,Fancy a game of Iron Hearts later?
44782,"Ha! That'll teach the little jester to go bothering the decent, hardworking folk of Skyrim. Fool never should have come here."
44783,You're a monster. Leave and never come back!
44785,Skjor's somewhere ahead. We need to find him.
44786,"Cut out the middleman, eh? Shrewd, very shrewd. You sure you don't have some Black-Briar blood in you?"
44787,Good. But know that further dishonor to my family will mean your death.
44789,"I knew you had it in you. After all, finding the Stones was no easy feat."
44791,So. You're an Imperial spy... Interesting...
44794,"This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor."
44795,Who will speak for her?
44796,If you say so. If this were anyone but you I would lock them up.
44799,I understand. It just isn't me. I'm not a warrior and I don't think I ever will be.
44800,Who will speak for him?
44802,And would you raise your sword in her honor?
44803,"Nice try, fat-fingers!"
44806,Hmm. Very well. I'm putting my reputation on the line for you.
44807,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
44810,Mirabelle will be waiting for you.
44812,Careful!
44817,"No! Oh, by the gods, please no!"
44818,"It's an old tree. Very old. They say it was a seedling when the first men were arriving from Atmora, thousands of years ago."
44820,I don't talk to people who drink that Black Briar drench. 
44823,"Ah, contracts like that are few and far between, it seems. Makes me long for the old days..."
44824,"If you're interested, I could point out a good place that could use a little housecleaning."
44826,So Madanach was behind those murders. Gods help us.
44827,"I used to dream of it. In the dream, I was standing... someplace high up... a tower, or mountain."
44828,"Oh, the Listener, well... listens! The Night Mother speaks to you. Guides you on your path."
44829,"I... I cannot deny the truth of what you say. Erik is all the family that I have left, but it's wrong to hold him back as I have."
44830,Some line about this claw thing and Yngol Barrow. He said it was worth more than its weight in gold if I took it back there.
44831,"First, let's count the coin, then we can get back to business."
44832,"I'll be back, and you'll be dead!"
44833,"Get away from me, you filthy woman."
44834,If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.
44835,I heard about what happened...
44837,Someone do something!
44838,We've got to find a way out of here.
44839,Welcome to Khajiit's humble camp.
44840,"Sure, fine. Thanks for nothing. You already got what you needed from me."
44841,"If you have come to see our wares, speak to the others."
44842,"When I started out in this business, I wasn't really interested in the Guild or being a thief."
44843,"What makes you think I'll give that to you, if I wouldn't give you Markarth?"
44845,I know some of you are ex-legion and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you.
44846,"Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over."
44848,"May the sun warm your path, friend."
44849,Have you heard about Goldenglow Meadery?
44851,"Please, come and browse our goods."
44853,"Warm sands, friend. How may this one serve you?"
44854,Welcome to you.
44856,The Blades have always guarded and guided the Dragonborn. But we'd forgotten why.
44860,"Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we stopped following those years ago."
44861,"It is a strange sight, the white flakes that sometimes fall from the sky."
44863,A peaceful greeting to you.
44867,I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here. 
44868,"Maybe some other time I'll reveal your destiny, hmm? Tea leaves, palm reading, crystal scrying... Oooh! Maybe trepanning? Ha ha ha ha. "
44872,"Still, I've got this axe, and even if I can't use it, I'm sure someone would make a deal for it. Maybe I'll have a word with Molag Bal..."
44873,The wind blows bitter cold in this place.
44877,"Greetings, Arch-Mage."
44878,So you say. We'll see if that's true when the Stormcloaks make their move.
44879,"I'm sorry, Ghorza. I just... flinch, and uh...."
44880,"On the ninth of Rain's Hand our prayers went unanswered, yet here we stand, not faltering in our belief that soon you will show yourself to us."
44881,I think the College is due for a change in leadership.
44882,I have traveled far across Tamriel to serve you.
44884,It can't be... You... You took its very soul...
44886,My bones ache for the moonsugar. It has been too long since I tasted it.
44888,"Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking."
44890,Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall... so well preserved... I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akaviri sculptural relief...
44891,"Here's another septim, Madesi. How much more do I need?"
44892,"Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse."
44894,"It's all in the way you hold the axe. Caress it, like any wench, and she'll do ya right."
44896,"It is a pity, but it cannot be helped. Perhaps if we continue to show that we can be trusted, they will open their cities to our caravans."
44898,"We have been in this land for so long, I have forgotten what it feels like to walk on warm sand."
44901,I'm certain we'll find some treasure down here.
44902,All this talk of dragons returning to the world makes me more than a little nervous.
44903,Moons protect us! I hope we do not encounter one of them on the road.
44904, 
44907,"See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid. You understand that."
44908,Bormah!
44909,Do you believe all this talk of dragons? Can the ancient ones truly have returned?
44912,"I wish I could say that I did not, but in every part of Skyrim, there is talk of dragon sightings. It is no coincidence."
44913,"And by Ysmir, if you find work, just do what you're told. There's enough trouble in Markarth already."
44914,I'm not certain if I could even make it to the top without collapsing from exhaustion.
44916,"I feel pity for these Nords. When the dragons attack cities and towns, they will lose everything."
44917,Tekla. The Hall is filthy. See to your cleaning.
44918,I wonder if we should offer discounts to the soldiers.
44919,"Do this and I shall remember you and bestow an important task upon you. Do this not, and I shall forget you, and your soul will waste in obscurity."
44921,Come up to the Skyforge to pay your respects.
44922,"The soldiers? From which side, the Stormcloaks, or the Imperials?"
44925,"Both. One or the other is bound to win the war eventually. Why not curry favor now, so that the victor will look upon us kindly?"
44926,"You're not one of those Alik'r thugs, are you?"
44927,"Hah, you have the foresight of a Khajiit in a sandstorm. If we offer a discount to both sides, the winners will persecute us for helping the losers."
44928,"A dragon? That's... ridiculous. You aren't drunk, are you boy?"
44931,"Between the war and the return of the dragons, I wonder if we should not leave Skyrim and ply our trade elsewhere."
44934,We'll have to find another way around.
44936,But the only way you're going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an invited guest.
44937,"Because war is good for business, of course."
44938,"If you can get past his trained watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second floor balcony in his backyard."
44939,Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and that was in Mercer's company.
44941,"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
44943,"Good, we could use the coin."
44945,You didn't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants.
44949,Ahhh!
44954,I trust this is the last I'll hear of your violent outbursts.
44955,Talk to Vex. She used to know him very well... if you catch my meaning.
44956,"See to that, and I'll tell you what you want to know."
44957,Gah!
44958,"Mercer's holding something over his head, keeping him loyal."
44962,"That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one."
44963,"Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with gullible Cicero!"
44966,"I'll give you a few more minutes. I can't wait here all day. It's my neck on the line, remember."
44967,Goldenglow Estate provided a huge payout for us before Aringoth locked us out.
44970,The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals. It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep.
44972,Anything I can do.
44974,"Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the details."
44975,"Welcome, my sister. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you."
44976,"Sure, whatever you say. Bye."
44978,"By Talos, Mercer has a lot to answer for."
44979,Of mine? What is it?
44980,"You outsiders never learn. If the Forsworn don't get you, the guards will throw you in Cidhna Mine to work your fingers off."
44986,My men? What did you do? You'll die for this.
44987,"Wait, it's haunted? I don't like ghosts... let me think about this for a minute..."
44990,"There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of."
44991,How can we fight Alduin? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
44992,"Valmir, you rat. You're not a soldier at all! Must be one of the Thalmor!"
44993,"Would've been fine dying for the Reach with my kinsmen, but the Silver-Bloods want their ore mined, so they threw me in here."
44994,"I'm a Forsworn. One of our raids went bad, and I got captured."
44995,Stay away from that.
44999,"Year seven, I think? Surprised I haven't cut my own throat out by now, but something keeps me going."
45000,But these Forsworn. They're nothing like the men I cobbled together. They're real killers.
45003,"Doesn't really matter. Thanks, but no."
45004,Roggvir always talked about his honor. Seems to me honorable men don't get executed.
45006,"Guards say I murdered someone. I was just sleeping off some mead in my aunt's house, but that didn't stop them from arresting me."
45011,"Oh, the fruit looks so good. So juicy."
45012,Long enough.
45013,"He made most of the arrangements himself, he just needed it transported from Morrowind. That's what I agreed to help with."
45014,The first time? Thieving. The second time? Thieving. The third time? Thieving. It kind of keeps going like that.
45018,"It was a simple matter, really, when one has mastered the art of camouflage. Scale becomes stone, becomes shadow. Then... death."
45020,"Now, I..."
45021,Maybe. For now just lay low and do your job. I have a feeling we'll be rid of the Captain soon...
45022,"Just give me the letter. I presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good."
45023,"Have the books, do you? I mean, I'm very glad. That's wonderful."
45024,Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me.
45027,"You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?"
45028,"Still, you've gotten me out of that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to you."
45029,We could use a pair of hands and a strong back. There'd be a little coin in it for you.
45031,"Let this whole thing blow over, you know. Give certain parties a chance to forget what I may have done."
45033,"You'll be going back to the College, then? I, uhh... I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself."
45034,"Yes, you certainly do."
45038,Your depths will open to the mind!
45041,But... you're right. There's nothing to be gained by refusing the Greybeards' request.
45042,Yes!
45043,"The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do."
45044,Yes sir. 
45046,You ants don't have the power to bind me!
45047,Look deeply into the faces of the warriors around you. These are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim. See her strength and nobility in their eyes.
45052,"Not with all those soldiers all over the hold. Their horses can't see you, you know."
45056,Can you believe that fool had the audacity to speak of his love for the Empire in the plaza?
45057,"Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you, but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do."
45059,"Frida, you aren't saying...."
45061,"Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life."
45062,"In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here."
45063,"You're... still alive. Cicero respects the Listener's abilities, of course, but could you at least slow down a bit? I'm not what I used to be. Heh."
45064,Although... that court wizard does all manner of experiments. And I know he owns some truly strange things.
45066,Hey. You wanna play a game?
45068,"You haven't heard any more about dragon sightings, have you?"
45070,"Why, hello! Here to buy? If you have to ask the price, you may be in the wrong store."
45071,"Hey, I cut you into the deal. There's nothing else to discuss."
45072,She'll answer any questions you have.
45074,Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical activity. I seem to be having trouble staying on my feet at the moment.
45075,We heading out?
45077,Here. Take this. For your time and all that.
45079,Nah. I don't think so.
45080,He'll answer any questions you have.
45081,"Without that axe, this whole land would be overrun still."
45082,Do you think Tekla has been talking to Siddgeir again?
45085,"It's nothing, I just... It's Nazeem. How did we get to this point, Danica? Is there no love left between us?"
45086,"Just be careful, Gralnach. That copse doesn't look safe. If you see any trouble, you run right home."
45087,"But I cannot go to it, not poor Septimus, for I... I have arisen beyond its grasp."
45088,"I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your first class. Are you ready to begin?"
45089,"""Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor..."""
45091,We knew you would succeed.
45092,"How are the headaches, dear? You or your mother still having them?"
45093,That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!
45094,I would hope that's obvious.
45096,I watch you to make sure you are honorable. 
45097,"Oh, but this isn't at all what Mother would want. You kill the Keeper or I kill the Listener? Now that's madness."
45098,Oh alright.  Well I'll be here for a bit if you change your mind.
45102,"A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died."
45103,You have? Where? Tell me now!
45105,Bassianus is still so terrified of Jofthor.
45106,Now tell me where she is!
45107,"Money, if that is what you wish."
45114,"Neat weapon. You're not going to hurt anybody, though. Right?"
45115,"All right, Delvin. What gives with that case of Shadowbanish you sold me?"
45116,Guess the headsman's been busy with all your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha!
45117,"You need to tell your boys to place nice, Delvin. Almost threw two of them into the well last night."
45121,"Yeah, funny thing about that. The price was a hundred higher than I expected."
45123,Dawnstar is the last port of call before Solitude. Damn rebels aren't taking it.
45125,"What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing."
45126,"Vekel, you have no shame. I'll get you the rest like I said. I want that hammer."
45127,"Come on, Ton. Marry me. Let me take care of you."
45131,"Alright... here you go. Should keep you light on your feet, and hold up decent enough if you wind up trading blows with the enemy."
45132,The day might come when I am forced to draw my sword for one side or the other.
45134,"Damn it, I lost him!  Protect the Jarl!"
45135,"Please milady, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?"
45136,"Blessings of the moons upon you, traveler."
45137,"What's the matter, soldier? I gave you an order. I want that fort, and I want it now. Move it!"
45138,I'm sorry. Good luck.
45139,I do not like fish.
45140,"Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife."
45143,There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
45146,Klimmek is doing just fine. You should follow your heart.
45150,Are you joking? Go earn a living and stop loafing!
45153,I had another run-in with the Thieves Guild.
45154,"Yes, I hope this helps."
45155,"Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end of time - it is for naught."
45156,"Now, go away."
45158,I could get rich and stop selling these trinkets.
45160,"The blood calls, brother."
45162,Your kind started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
45163,Spare a coin?
45164,"You know, I saw something near Shimmermist Cave, to the northeast. Some kind of creature... small and wicked. Never seen its like before."
45165,I don't know what I'm going to do with you. I can't just let this go unpunished.
45167,I suppose. Just get something to eat and stay away from the Bee and Barb for a change.
45168,Have you seen Laelette? Have you seen my wife?
45169,I don't know. Are you not listening at all?
45172,For the moment we have ceased hostilities. We'll see what these Imperials have to say. I doubt we'll come to any lasting agreement.
45173,I'm still finding your Spiced Wine to be the best drink I've ever tasted.
45175,"Saraan uth - I await your command, as promised. Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?"
45176,There were also two items requiring disciplinary action recently.
45177,Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me.
45178,"Ugh, you smell horrible. Get yourself cleaned up."
45179,"If I had even a pot to piss in, I'd gladly share. Sorry."
45181,"I find the concept of sleeping with you not only repulsive, but morally unsettling. Does that answer your question?"
45184,Remember to tell that bastard I never want to see his ugly face again!
45186,You have done the world a great service.
45187,"Oh, a customer. Sorry you had to hear that."
45190,"Well, can't say exactly where the mold is, but something does spring to mind."
45191,Do you think I could be a member of the Circle? Some day? If I work hard?
45192,Why are the potions I requested not completed?
45193,"Need a weapon? Hmmm... By the looks of ya, yeah... Think I've got somethin' you can use."
45197,"There's still the matter of the prisoner to discuss. Now, his family is willing to contribute handsomely if we release him."
45198,"Are you going soft on me, Hemming? Perhaps I made the wrong choice installing you as steward."
45201,"Yes, and I sent it with our fastest courier and under the cover of night, exactly as you specified."
45202,"Good. If I need to light a few fires in order to get what we need to defend this place from the Stormcloaks, so be it."
45204,I'll let him know.
45206,Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?
45207,Your mother seems to have taken to her seat quite well.
45208,"Try not to set anything on fire, all right?"
45209,"Yes, she's been grooming herself for this for quite a long time."
45214,"You're disgusting, stay away from me."
45216,"Well that depends on what the favor is, now doesn't it."
45218,"I'll talk to him, but he's stubborn. He's like his mother; he sees what he wants and he won't quit until he has it."
45220,"She gets the books, I get you. It's very simple."
45221,Anything you can do to keep his filthy hands off of me would be a welcome change.
45223,"Now, since we're not the Dark Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him, we're just going to make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days."
45226,This is an utter waste of time.
45227,You really want to help? You go offer yourself at Malacath's Shrine. Petition him for help.
45228,"Careful of the molten metal. That gets on you, kiss your fingers goodbye."
45230,"You didn't hear it from me, but if you want a real drink, try the Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter."
45231,"Oh, for the salt spray, the creek of the mast, and the clash of sabers. Those were the days..."
45233,And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.
45234,We've made peace with one another without even uttering a single word and I'm content for the first time in my life.
45237,"I'm sorry, could you describe the smell?"
45238,"If you need pickpocket training, just let me know."
45239,"Edda, Edda. There's no need for this. Just come by the temple and we'll care for you."
45241,I like the farm life. It's a huge change from living in a city.
45242,"If you'd stop wasting your coin on that skooma, you'd have enough gold to live on."
45244,"Fine. You play in the mud, or play with your father's forge, or get into sword fights with your little friend. But this is not over."
45245,"It is making patrons nervous. It needs to put the weapon away, now."
45246,"Not to worry, dear Svana. I promise you I can handle it, but your concern is quite flattering."
45247,It's an evil substance. Whoever's selling it to you should be brought to justice.
45249,"Die, worm!"
45251,"If there was any justice in the world, I'd just get this over with and die peacefully."
45253,Yes. These are Akaviri symbols.
45254,"Look, if you're in some sort of trouble, I could talk to Haelga."
45255,You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?
45256,"If I cared for your opinion on our affairs, I'd ask. Now, if you'll excuse me."
45257,"'Tis a wicked axe you wield there, friend. That blade looks sharp enough to cut through a god."
45260,"Bless you, friend. You have renewed my hope."
45264,"You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn."
45266,You saw her ghost?
45267,"When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to."
45269,"Many Stormcloaks will fight until they die, because they still believe they're fighting for Skyrim's freedom."
45270,Looks like you've already got someone with you.
45271,"Elda, honey, let's not talk about the war. It's in the past."
45274,"I'm not proud of Hrefna's father. If she knew him, she wouldn't be either."
45275,"Need a drink, you go to the Bee and Barb. Stay out of the Ragged Flagon, stay out of the Ratway."
45276,"Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that."
45278,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
45279,"Some folk here will tell you I'm sheltering my boy too much, but I ask you, isn't it a father's duty to keep his children safe?"
45280,"Shor's bones, girl. What did I tell you? "
45281,"Well, I'll just have to think of something else then. Bye."
45283,Come on. Finish it!
45284,Awww. And here I thought you could do it...
45285,I wish everyone could just get past that and get on with their lives.
45287,"Unless we have specific business, I'm not interested."
45288,"Sure, sure. It's just, you know, not every day I meet someone who's laid eyes on a dragon."
45294,"I see I still have much to learn. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time."
45297,Hey... So are you ever going to make me invisible or what?
45302,Surprise! Ahaha!
45303,Oooooh... weeeeoooooo.... 
45305,I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.
45306,"General Tullius has his headquarters in Castle Dour, in the city of Solitude, northwest of here."
45309,Now our business together is done.
45311,"Right, I really am busy. So..."
45313,"There are so few rules here. All we ask is that you don't disrespect your Family. But for some reason, you have. Best talk to Nazir and pay the fine."
45314,It's not the cold of Skyrim that gets to me. It's the stink from the people. 
45316,"Ah, don't worry, we all like to break the rules sometimes. Just see Nazir and pay the fine. Seems I do that at least once a month..."
45319,"They call him ""the Skinner."""
45320,Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now.
45324,They haven't moved out of the caves. I think we're safe.
45327,"You slaughtered them - the women, the children! You butchers!"
45328,What brings you to Balimund today? Repair? Purchase?
45331,Good. I'll spread the word that you've made reparations. Now let's forget the past and get back to business...
45336,Bah! A child could have accomplished it. Such is the power of the arcane. If you only knew of the spells I didn't use. He he he he he.
45337,"Three guards run into a bar, but the fourth one just ducks. Why?"
45340,It involves a recipe for a liquid known as Vaermina's Torpor.
45341,"They are discreet and thorough, though not inexpensive. I hope you'll keep that in mind, should the worst come to pass."
45343,Your funeral. Someone else is gonna have to help you get him back in there again.
45344,Damnit. Where'd they get catapults? The city walls are already falling apart as it is.
45346,"Sure, and I'm Queen Barenziah. Now tell me another one."
45348,"Riften will be handed over to Imperial control. Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften."
45353,"And you, Jorleif?"
45354,"You've done a great thing, today. It doesn't matter who you support in the war; Potema would have been a blight on the land for both sides."
45358,"Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp."
45359,Yes... father.
45361,Point that somewhere else!
45368,"I think the man you want to talk to is Nelacar. He was exiled a few years ago, bad research. Still hangs around the Frozen Hearth."
45371,"First time to Solitude? Beautiful old city. Capital of Skyrim, but I'm sure you already knew that."
45372,"Legate, with me. We have a lot of work to do."
45373,"You misunderstand. It's just... I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me, I'd be a wreck."
45374,"Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it."
45375,"Many Orcs leave the stronghold to join the Legion. They welcome our skill in battle and smithing, and we welcome a chance to see the world."
45377,... and may we one day rejoin them in eternity.
45378,Sheathe your weapons and come quietly!
45379,"But I have a place here, and I wouldn't want to dishonor my clan by leaving again like some young pup."
45382,"Well, for that much, I don't think Malacath would turn his scowl on me. All right, outlander. My axe is yours."
45383,Indeed. Avanchnzel is as much a library as it is a city. Built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer. 
45386,As you wish.
45389,You must excuse me. I shouldn't be here.
45390,"What you learn here will last you a lifetime. Several, if you're talented."
45392,Here we go again.
45393,"I am Larak's daughter. Soon, I'll be of age and will be sent to marry an Orc chief in some distant stronghold."
45394,The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war.
45395,No. A chief's daughter marries who her chief wishes. It ensures the stronghold receives a fair trade in goods for my absence.
45396,No interest in being immortalized in song? Remembered and praised for all eternity?
45399,Is any man ever ready to give the order that will mean the deaths of many.
45401,"What do you know about my people, outlander?"
45402,That's just terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that.
45404,"People of Riften, heed my words. The return of the dragons is not mere coincidence."
45406,Results speak volumes over words and you've just proved it.
45407,"You are new here, are you not? We have not spoken."
45409,It is imperative that you return to your College at once.
45410,There's a small shrine to Mara I established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek spiritual guidance from Her.
45411,"Sure I'm a little green, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in courage."
45412,"Now do whatever it is you need to do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!"
45413,"Fall, damn you!"
45415,"You'll have to prove yourselves, but I'm willing to give you a chance. Gularzob's in charge now. Let's hope he's a better chief."
45416,You're as good as dead!
45417,Can't you see I'm working? Beat it.
45418,Keep your head about you.
45419,"If you don't like that kind of work, talk to Delvin. He runs the more up-close and personal jobs."
45420,Jarl's been looking for someone who ain't superstitious though. Be lookin' for a fool if you ask me.
45422,Are you finished your other business and ready to face the Guild?
45423,"Ha! I knew it, you rascal! By Sithis, the old man was worth the trouble."
45424,"No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside."
45425,Yiiee!
45426,Nyargh!
45429,"How are your chores coming, my son?"
45430,Rargh!
45434,"Come on, put up a fight!"
45435,"I may not be fond of Letrush, but even I've got to admit he's got the upper hand."
45437,Work in it? I own it.
45438,"There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!"
45442,"What? Oh, hardly! I don't think even Ulfric could pull a dragon out of his pocket."
45443,"What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?"
45444,Welcome to our home.
45448,But you disappeared! You were there... then you weren't! Did you mean to help poor Cicero or not? I'm left to wonder...
45450,Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing.
45452,Your end is near!
45453,"From my view, I don't think we'll find anything here. "
45454,We'd better keep moving. I don't want to run into any Imperials who know what happened at Helgen.
45455,You're a liar! I won't listen to you. Leave me alone!
45460,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this isn't it."
45461,Twelve septims on the big one!
45462,I'll cut your throat!
45464,You're mine!
45465,Noooo!
45466,"Actually, you do. Sort of."
45467,"Listen, Roggvir and I grew up together. It was us, a few others and Vivienne. Vivienne Onis."
45468,"There's a place for trash, and that's not it."
45469,Nnnnyyaarrgghh!
45470,Hhyyaarrgghh!
45471,Yeeeaarrggh!
45475,"I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder."
45476,Rrargh!
45477,Unh!
45480,Gah!
45482,Arrggh!
45486,I can have a group of men ready at a moment's notice. Many would be willing to help rescue my brother.
45489,I've got some fight left in me!
45490,Nuhn!
45491,"Damn it, no more!"
45492,I'll... get you...
45494,Most of those don't happen very often.
45498,Shadows take me...
45499,You watch yourself out there.
45500,I really can't thank you enough for your help.
45502,You two will just have to learn to get along until we can build you another house.
45503,Your concerns are understandable; trust is a very difficult commodity to come by these days.
45504,"Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings."
45506,I can hear your heart beating.
45507,Well well. Another maggot to squash beneath my boot.
45509,I don't have time for this.
45511,I'm going to find you...
45516,I heard something.
45518,"This good deed should not go unrewarded. Here, take this!"
45519,The secret to chopping meat is never washing your hands.
45520,Thank you for your help.  Did you see my family inside?
45521,"Enough games, let's end this!"
45522,"Really? Power? Haven't you already killed enough of your foes using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic, etc.? How... uninspired."
45523,There you are!
45524,Just... know that your efforts are appreciated.
45525,I prefer working in silver. More skill needed than forging iron or steel.
45527,Hey!
45528,My coat? What do you need my coat for?
45531,"So, it begins."
45532,"But you were once man! Aye! And as man, you said, ""Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter."""
45536,"Well enough, I suppose. Nilsine bought up most of the tomatoes, and was asking if we could get more. "
45537,What's left of Skyrim to wager?
45538,You've just written your own epitaph.
45539,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
45543,You want in there? Here's my spare key. Take whatever you want.
45546,"If you have further need of me, you can find me in the College."
45548,"Take a look at my supplies if you must, but do hurry... I'm not getting any younger you know!"
45549,I better stay back and see to the old man. Good luck you two.
45552,"But imagine -- fleets of ships sailing from Windhelm, all bearing the Stormcloak flag! It would be glorious!"
45556,Wonderful. And let's not have this chat again next week. Agreed?
45557,"Take care, stranger. Be careful out there."
45558,You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?
45560,"I don't know, father... There's a whole world out there I want to see."
45562,I'll give no quarter!
45563,"If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the brewmaster, Mallus."
45564,Let's see where this goes.
45565,Been itching for a fight.
45566,And? I've seen jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months.
45567,"Now we're deep in debt, penniless and about to lose our sole source of income."
45568,"I think you dropped this! Good thing I brought it to you, huh?"
45569,You've got moments to live.
45573,Hmph. Hardly a challenge.
45574,"Hmm. I still don't like it, but I guess I'll overlook it. This time."
45576,Really? And what might that be?
45577,Happy hunting.
45578,You were no match for a Nightingale.
45581,"The blood calls, brother."
45583,I hardly felt a thing.
45584,I think they got the message.
45586,Is it time yet? Time for me to make my sword? Or maybe... an axe?
45587,"Ah! Here it is. Come, let me show you."
45588,Haven't fought like that in years.
45589,I do love my wife. Just wish she'd get her head out of the clouds.
45592,Be careful!
45594,Those were the days. I'd never seen my husband fight so bravely before.
45595,"Why, this is utterly unique."
45596,Maybe you could talk some sense into my pig-headed brother.
45598,Waste of time.
45599,Could you do an old elf a favor? I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return.
45600,It's just me and my mother at the mill here. My father is gone. We don't know what happened to him.
45602,Welcome to the center of the world. Or at least my brother Erikur's world...
45603,Festus has been spearheading this part of the assassination plan. He's close to uncovering the identity of the Gourmet. You should report to him.
45606,That was fun.
45607,This shouldn't take long.
45609,Show yourself!
45610,You can't hide forever!
45611,Where are you?
45612,I want vengeance for my wife!
45615,Where'd you go?
45616,"While there is no direct evidence of this, it does seem likely."
45617,Coward.
45618,A bold but foolish move.
45619,"I'll send my men to secure any of the remaining goods you left behind. We can't have that substance falling into the wrong hands now, can we?"
45620,That's certainly an understatement. I've never seen anything like this!
45621,It's the same dream over and over again. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!
45624,You can't hide from me!
45625,"So, you reveal yourself!"
45627,No. That won't be enough.
45628,"That is a fine idea. The stronghold would need the gold when I left to marry, anyway. I am ready when you are."
45629,You dare challenge a child of Malacath?
45632,"You wouldn't be a sellsword, would you? I have a little problem you could solve."
45634,"Came all the way out here to see us, did you?"
45636,"After you, Dragonborn. You should have the honor of being the first to set foot in Sky Haven Temple."
45637,Your blood won't bother me!
45638,"But a group of Dark Elf refugees gets ambushed? A group of Argonians, or a Khajiit caravan? No troops. No investigation. Nothing."
45640,"I'm a warrior, not a blacksmith."
45643,Now it's time to use all three at once.
45645,This is insane! I didn't steal anything! I never saw this ring before in my entire life!
45646,I may have accidentally let a prisoner escape. The leader of one of those bandit groups.
45648,"A ruler is entitled to luxury, don't you think? The Thalmor understand that."
45650,"Uh, a nail?"
45655,"Now I've got the itch to travel again. If you're leaving town, I wouldn't mind coming with for a while."
45656,"I thank you and the college thanks you, Jarl."
45658,"Then you know that Gourmet keeps his identity a secret. I'm hoping to discover who he is, so I can tell him how he changed my life."
45659,You've been here long enough to know that Nords aren't always sensible. 
45660,"Yes. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here."
45661,It's Hemming. He's making advances and I can't bear the man's presence. Is there anything you can do?
45663,"I was the finest scout in the Legion, once. Tracked down all the places in the wilds that were causing people trouble."
45666,"Back to the swamp with you, Argonian. Lest I carve you into boots."
45670,"There's another piece, that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers and bring it back for me?"
45672,"When people talk about the decadent, tottering Empire, it's people like you they have in mind!"
45674,...
45676,Mystical beings who live in legends and were masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their veins!
45677,"Jarl wants it to look like an ancient blade. High Queen Freydis ruled over Windhelm in the Second Era, and her sword was legendary."
45678,Are you sure you aren't a stranger?
45679, 
45680,If it isn't Ice-Veins. Hi there.
45682,"Oh, you could? I sure would love to have it again. Could show you some of my old scouting tricks."
45683,"There's a poem I once used on an older lady of Rorikstead. I can change it to be about Faleen, if you've got some gold."
45685,Pfft. Ungrateful milk drinker.
45686,This damned war has cost us... me... everything.
45690,Very well.
45691,"Is it really me, or is it your wife? You need to make a choice Bolli. The honey or her."
45694,Why am I not surprised?
45697,Thanks a lot! Here. Take this. For all your hard work.
45699,"Looking to blow yourself up? I hear that's what magic does to you. There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic, unless that blew up too."
45700,Come to gawk at the dark elf?
45701,"They're masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they're the ones who can teach you how to use your power."
45702,Look at that edge. Still sharp.
45703,One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.
45707,"Well hey, that's not something you see every day."
45708,"Thank you. It's a collection of regrets that I try not to forget. Here, I promised you this."
45709,What about him?
45713,"Okay, great!"
45715,Speak to Styrr. He can help.
45717,Get your ward ready.
45721,Been working in Iron-Breaker since I was a boy.
45722,Great! Now I'm going to cast some spells at you. Keep your ward up so I can study it.
45723,"If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way."
45726,Another foul day at the smelter.
45727,M'aiq does not understand what is so impressive about shouting. M'aiq can shout whenever he wants.
45728,We would but there's a big wedding taking place at Castle Dour. We'll have to wait until after the wedding. 
45730,The guards in this city are all lazy and undisciplined. Things need to change...
45732,Wait... who are you? Intruder!
45734,Be warned. Many have thought as you do. I have broken them all. You shall not evade me forever.
45736,"Vile! None of that - you made a deal, and the mortal stood by it honestly. Now it's your turn to come through."
45738,Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this? 
45740,Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.
45745,Really? He's safe? Where is he?
45746,"I may have entered into an... agreement with Enthir. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine."
45747,"Thanks for the compliment, Delvin. I may just take you up on that one day."
45748,"Come Galmar, we have much to do."
45751,Sometimes I wonder if Ulfric understands what I'm dealing with out here.
45753,I'm becoming sick to death of your ideas. Not one of them has paid off since you moved in.
45757,"Like it or not, you are a shining example to future generations of College Mages."
45759,I'm not saying it wouldn't be useful. But there are better uses of our resources right now.
45760,"Already done, sir."
45763,There is no help for you here.
45764,"Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray Mercer Frey."
45765,Try casting a spell at the wall. See what happens!
45766,Good. You make sure the lug tips you when he gets it.
45768,"Yes, yes, you're the new Family member. Let's make this easy - consider me the cranky old uncle nobody talks to. You go your way, I'll go mine."
45769,Potema herself? Please tell me you stopped them.
45777,"I'll just be on my way then. Please do be careful, and thank you."
45784,There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans were shelved and the rest is history.
45789,I'm right behind you.
45790,"Did she, perhaps, mention any dangerous research she might be working on? Anything that could get her in trouble?"
45791,"You're going to love it here. We have a lot of fun, and we look out for each other. Just like any family."
45792,"You just trust in Astrid, follow her orders, and you'll do fine here."
45793,What is it doing? Walking around nearly naked...
45794,"Bein' a thief is like a second skin for you, ain't it? Never seen anythin' like it."
45795,Hmph. 
45796,"There are also spells that help in avoiding conflict altogether. Invisibility is tricky to master, but exceptionally useful."
45798,"Oh yes, please, kind sir. My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley."
45799,"Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth... your teeth! No! Aggghh!!"
45800,Now let us see if you are willing and able to learn.
45801,"Oh Babette, but you are so wicked."
45803,Your life is mine!
45805,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
45806,"Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!"
45807,Please! Don't hurt me again!
45808,"Laila is a simple and traditional woman. Which makes it easy to manipulate her, but impossible to regain her graces once offended."
45809,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
45810,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
45811,"I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style."
45812,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
45813,How much do they pay you per day?
45814,"Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly."
45817,Ha! I do love it when the mortals know they're being manipulated. Makes things infinitely more interesting.
45818,I won't take no for answer!
45821,"I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond you."
45823,"This is a magic duel. Ma-gic. You know, with spells."
45824,The Stormcloaks pay blood for blood!
45825,"Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it?"
45826,Aye. I'm the headsman here in Solitude. It's my job.
45827,"If you're here to join the Stormcloaks, the palace is inside. "
45830,"Peace, Galmar."
45834,"King Harald's forces crushed stragglers here the during the First Era and it has been haunted ever since, but the specifics of the siege are unclear."
45835,It seems that after the strength of the Cult was broken in the Dragon War a last contingent came here to create a stronghold and regroup.
45836,"Oh, I know it! You keep working hard, like you been doing, and you could be the greatest blacksmith Skyrim has ever seen."
45838,"I should warn you, Forelhost is quite haunted, but I'm sure you can handle it. Return to me here once you've obtained the staff."
45839,I need you to take a case of mead to the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
45840,The magical energies underneath the College still require purification. Your assistance would be most useful.
45844,"I don't know why I'm saying this, but if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you."
45845,My job's simple enough. The dead don't really complain much. 
45847,"Wait, I know you. You went into the Emperor's Tower, just before... before his decoy was murdered..."
45850,"Before the Oblivion Crisis, many elves called Winterhold their home. More visited the College from Morrowind every year."
45853,I... I see.
45854,Good.
45855,"It's quite simple really. There are some who shall not be dignified by being named, who have implied that it is not."
45856,"It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service."
45857,I wish I was a soldier! They get to travel and stay up late and have fun!
45860,Ha! I think you're bleeding!
45861,"Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself!"
45863,"And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity."
45864,"You just let old nana know if you need anything, all right dear?"
45866,"A risky game to play, friend."
45870,A mage is only as good as what he knows. I try and make sure as much knowledge is available as possible.
45872,Thank you for coming.
45875,"Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?"
45876,"I've told you, we can't talk out in the open. Come with me."
45878,"Of course, non-mages may not see it that way, so we don't go around flaunting it."
45879,"Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used."
45880,Although I suppose a little mead now and then would be harmless...
45881,Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.
45885,"Anyway, much appreciated. Here, take this for your troubles."
45886,"Those Battle-Born... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face!"
45887,Haven't seen her around before.
45888,You wanted to see me?
45889,"By all means, show me."
45891,We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.
45894,"Just be careful. Casting wards requires constant concentration, and you can easily find yourself drained of your magicka reserves."
45895,"Oh, this should be good."
45896,Kynareth preserve us.
45897,"Ah, hello my Argonian friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?"
45898,Don't you think I'd make a wonderful Master Wizard? Maybe even Arch-Mage someday?
45900,"Yes, my love? What do you need?"
45901,You'll never see the sun again. No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one.
45903,The key to wards is that they take time to charge.
45906,Stay safe.
45907,Get over to Falkreath.
45908,Good. Maybe things will be different around here from now on.
45909,I see you've been minding your own business. So how is the mind business?
45912,"Meat Pies. Try one for free, come back for more. Get your meat pies."
45915,"Until next time, sister."
45916,"Don't leave me, for Arkay's sake!"
45917,"Farewell, farewell!"
45920,Cicero bids you... farewell.
45921,Watch yourself out there.
45922,Just give me a moment.
45923,"Represent us well, sister."
45924,"Represent us well, brother."
45926,It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was looking into it before he was murdered.
45927,"Yeah, good luck."
45929,"You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool... the sea."
45930,"Browse as much as you like, please."
45931,You're trailing me? I knew I heard something.
45933,What can I get for you?
45934,"Take care of yourself, beef roast."
45935,"Just come back alive, and I'll be happy."
45937,Uuuuhhhnnnn... aaarrrghhh....
45942,"Ah, well now you can help me directly! Far more useful, I think."
45943,"You realize if you set foot in there, you're never coming back out. They'll kill you."
45945,"Step aside, citizen."
45948,"Remember, fireballs. You can never go wrong."
45949,Burn that little jester alive.
45950,Darkness guide you.
45951,"Please, leave me to recover my... mental energies."
45952,"I married Rustleif when he was in Hammerfell, apprenticing under my father."
45953,Now it's time to face the consequences of your actions. You don't leave this shack until someone dies.
45957,So what do you want to know?
45959,Only way you could have found one of those is by stealin' it. Guess you'll fit in around here better than I thought.
45960,"Finally, someone with decent sense. The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos."
45962,"The name's Maul; I watch the streets for the Black-Briars. If you need dirt on anything, I'm your guy."
45964,You ready for some good old-fashioned burglary?
45965,"If there are any problems, let me know. It's my job to keep things running smoothly."
45969,"He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything."
45970,Do I look like a merchant to you? You're going to have to take that up with Vex in the Thieves Guild.
45971,Where are you going? Come back!
45974,Not exactly. The crown is what the Guild calls a paragon; an object that enhances our thieving abilities.
45975,"Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?"
45976,They'll never suspect an attack from the inside.
45977,Can I join the Legion when I grow up? 
45978,I don't want to be responsible for sending you to your death. Be careful in the mine.
45980,A conquering army. Ruthless mercenaries. A band of drunken louts. And the esteemed company you see before you. 
45981,"If we want to stay on top in Skyrim, the Guild needs that paragon back."
45983,"Good. The dragon's soul should be making you stronger. Come back another time, and we'll track down another one for you."
45984,I'll gladly share a portion of the bounty in return for your efforts in seeing proper justice done.
45985,"Comes the end of the day, Imperials and Stormcloaks ain't much different."
45986,"But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort."
45987,"Don't be so sure. Now, have you finished grinding the dried snowberries? "
45989,Dragons have always been able to Shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being.
45990,The Emperor can kiss my ass!
45991,"Oh, they care all right. Just none of them thinks to do anything about it."
45993,"Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of ""Kest."""
45994,Mauhulakh. He wants to be a leader but spends too much time moping over women. Bolar and I should be all he needs.
45995,"Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of ""Nah."""
45996,"Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of ""Wuld."""
45999,"There's someone I like very much in Riften. I think I'd like to marry him someday, but... well, he's not of my kind. Would Mara be angry?"
46002,She's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
46003,Their Voices are too powerful for anyone not trained in the Way to withstand. Even a whisper could kill you.
46004,I could easily provide my spells to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.
46005,"When your Voice can open the path, you will know you are ready to speak to him."
46007,Get over to Falkreath. We're mounting our final attack!
46008,"Fine, but we'll be keeping an eye on you."
46009,"The Redoran contract? Yes, you heard correctly. In and out of Vvardenfell in less than forty eight hours."
46010,"But that's nonsense. You can't handle a group of Forsworn by yourself. If their axes don't get you, their magic will."
46012,How can you just sit here and wait? We should be in there!
46014,We must gather our strength. Who knows what's inside?
46015,Sky guard you.
46016,"What I lack in strength, I make up for with tenacity."
46018,Can't imagine what he expects to do with that... it's warped beyond any ability to capture a soul.
46020,Wind guide you.
46021,This one's mine.
46023,Go away!
46025,"I am a lethal instrument, yours to command for a modest sum. I suggest you hire me before one of your enemies does."
46027,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
46028,"The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back."
46030,"Go talk to the Greybeards, see what they can tell you."
46031,Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days.
46033,By the nine!
46036,"I hear the East Empire Company has reopened, thanks in no small part to you. Well done. All of Skyrim benefits from their trade."
46037,Ysmir's beard - I don't like the look of this...
46039,I'm in the middle of something. But don't go far. I'll need you soon.
46040,"In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance."
46041,I am your sword and your shield.
46042,"Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods."
46043,Stand in the center of the room and prepare yourself to taste the Voice of the Greybeards.
46044,"You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear."
46045,"Vulwulf! The Empire may be our enemy, but Asgeir is still our son and we're a long way from Cyrodiil."
46048,You! You're the one who wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! All the guards are talking about it... You're a hero to us all!
46049,Pit bait.
46050,One thing everyone can agree on. This war is bad for business.
46052,Mind yourself.
46053,Lok!
46057,"No. And they're afraid of you, of your power."
46058,"Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?"
46059,I'm impressed.
46061,"If you're not doing something you enjoy, then you're wasting your life."
46062,Look out!
46063,Feel free to take a look around the store.
46067,There he is!
46069,Stand together and we shall defeat him!
46070,"Ach, there you are."
46072,"Maybe Nazeem's obsession has merit. This civil war seems so big, so unceasing... I'm afraid, Danica. Afraid for us all."
46073,"But if you live in fear of what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the Greybeards up on their mountain."
46074,How can a humble servant of Talos help you today?
46076,Too slow.
46077,This won't take long.
46078,"Hmph, so you're the one everyone's falling over."
46079,"But I'm learning about magic, and that's what they do there. Shouldn't I go?"
46080,"If you had it, you'd be riding and we wouldn't be talking."
46082,"Lok, Thu'um."
46083,"You'll be clearing a nest of those Hagraven things. I've never faced one myself, but I hear... disturbing things about them."
46084,"The ""problem"" is your disrespect for the laws of this land. It's time to face the Jarl's justice."
46088,Somebody get that idiot some armor...
46089,"Yes, let's!"
46091,"Just open the cage, and I'll leave quietly. Won't make a sound, won't bother you at all."
46092,"Welcome I do not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand."
46095,"Really, I think there's been a mistake."
46096,Vignar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
46098,Unblooded.
46099,"You just can't leave well enough alone, can you?"
46101,Found you!
46105,Nice shot! Right on target.
46107,"Normally, a quick death."
46108,I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.
46110,"Luckily for you, there are more pressing matters. We could make an example of you, but perhaps you could be put to better use."
46112,Suffice to say that our Sybil was recently lost to us.
46114,"Head on in. Keep your nose clean, and you won't have any problems with us."
46116,I don't expect you to know what that means. 
46118,What a vulgar display.
46119,"I just want to learn, I don't want to think about what's expected of me."
46126,Unlike your Imperial friends here.
46127,We believe the place in our vision to be Karthwasten.
46129,You'll have to come back another time. 
46130,The sisters are communing with Dibella. They can't be disturbed.
46133,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. It's all right. You've been through a lot. Maybe you should just sit down for a bit..."
46141,Maybe one of these Imperials had the key.
46142,"I understand. We must all follow our own paths. If you wish to find me again, I'll be in Nightcaller Temple."
46144,It doesn't matter. I'm here. We're together now. And we will be forever.
46147,Well I think your betrothed might feel otherwise. The two of you will need to work this out before the temple will marry you.
46148,"I second that, Igmund. Who knows what that family will do for power? They could be working with the Forsworn, for all we know."
46149,This one wonders why you brandish your weapon so?
46151,There a reason you're walking around with an unsheathed weapon?
46154,Civilized people don't brandish their weapons unless they plan to use them.
46155,"These are troubling times, indeed."
46156,Hammers don't have legs.
46162,"While a good fight is always entertaining, my patrons don't like blood in their food. Put the weapon away."
46163,"I trust I won't have to, but I'll bust your head in if you cause problems for my patrons."
46165,"I could not raise him, but I will raise an army to avenge his defilement!"
46166,Relaxing? They must be working you to the bone! You should rest before you do yourself in.
46168,"First you take the job, now you don't even want it. I wish you'd make up your mind."
46175,"If you cause problems, I'll have to ask you to leave."
46176,"I call upon you Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow... hear my voice!"
46178,"The only question in my mind is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a bad aftertaste."
46179,I do know the Gourmet was classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So that's where he must have met Anton Virane.
46180,I'm a man. Skyrim is man's homeland. That's a fact. A fact I'm proud of. There's no shame in that. Read your history.
46181,"Unless you're here to sell that weapon of yours, why don't you put it away."
46182,Are you worried the Forsworn might return?
46184,"I've been wanting to say thanks for being a friend. Here. It's not much, but I was thinking you might like to have this."
46186,Don't you think all your tramping around there investigating might have something to do with it?
46187,Plenty of fresh fish for ya.
46189,You won't be intimidating me into lower prices. Put that thing away.
46191,You need to hear this!
46194,You're disturbing my other customers.
46196,He stokes the passions of the downtrodden in this city. Directs them to kill the enemies of the Forsworn in our name.
46197,Because Ulfric needed a symbol.
46199,"Fine weapon, but you wouldn't mind putting it away, I'm sure."
46201,Watch it with that thing!
46202,"Break my stuff with that weapon, and I'll break you."
46203,You should probably put that away before you knock something over.
46204,What the... 
46205,Leave that dog alone!
46206,"Maven Black-Briar is the owner of the largest and most profitable business in all Skyrim, the Black-Briar Meadery."
46208,"If that weapon breaks anything, you will be buying it."
46209,"I was hoping you'd change your mind. Come on. I'm heading to Riverwood, just up the road. My sister Gerdur will help us out."
46210,General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.
46211,"Don't break anything with that weapon, okay?"
46212,My nephew died. Things won't be the same without him.
46214,Leave me alone.
46216,It's not a cause. It's a rebellion.
46218,"I'm fairly certain you wandered into the wrong building, friend..."
46219,"Can you spare a septim? Lost an eye during the Great War, or I'd earn it myself..."
46220,Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send him back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
46221,Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal.
46222,"Pff. Go away, if you know what's good for you."
46223,"Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to get left out."
46224,Do me a favor and kill that little jester twice. Just to make sure.
46226,What's all the commotion?
46228,He's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
46230,You're sure?
46232,That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
46234,That remains to be seen.
46235,Doesn't matter. We'll kill them either way.
46236,"For your help, I'm sending word to the Orc strongholds that you're to be trusted. You should be welcome there now."
46238,Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful.
46240,I've been expecting you.
46242,Shhh. You'll scare the deer.
46243,"Draft another letter with the usual platitudes, but this time share some of your intelligence regarding Ulfric's plans. Embellish if you have to."
46245,Yes. I earned the right by slaying my father in single combat.
46247,"Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready."
46248,"If you'll pardon me now, my crew needs gathering. Should be in Hammerfell before the other Horkers know who let slip their secret."
46249,Are you here to talk about my brother? Do you think his execution was justified?
46251,Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial Authority on magic these last few hundred years.
46254,We're taking the capital. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
46257,"Sure, Ton. You know I'm good for it."
46258,"Every Legionnaire's secret weapon lies in this: knowledge of himself. And like any blade, he must be forged between the hammer and the anvil."
46259,What? That's not possible!
46260,Just wondering when you'll be ready to give it up and settle down. Seems like you're always working.
46261,She'll never find me here.
46263,A traveler? I'll be you've seen some sights. We should swap tales sometime.
46271,Our best hope now is to fall in with the ranks of the Stormcloaks.
46274,Best not to ask too many questions about it. People might get the wrong idea about you.
46275,"Ah, excellent. Well, it's good to know that won't be a problem any longer."
46276,"Maven wants this mark's most prized possession. The bloody fool carries it on his person all the time. So, think you can handle it?"
46277,I understand what's best for Solitude... and Jarl Elisif knows it.
46278,"You will hear me out, then? Good."
46281,"Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an Atronach to cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away. Use your imagination!"
46283,But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
46284,"Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even earn his respect."
46285,"Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven."
46286,"That's what I thought. Now get out of my way, baby. I got things to do."
46287,Slen...Nus!
46288,I'll already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!
46289,"All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this."
46290,I wouldn't mind teaching the ways of the pickpocket... if the gold was right.
46291,Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it.
46295,"Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done."
46297,"Now that you've brought Dravin's bow back, he's back to his crabby old self. For better or for worse, I still thank you."
46298,"What's the matter, Listener? Night Mother not feeling very chatty these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers?"
46300,You a pilgrim or just passing through?
46303,"Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once."
46304,"Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?"
46306,Can't help you. They're all spoken for.
46307,Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.
46308,Where do you want to go?
46309,You've got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day. What's next? Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?
46310,"But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly."
46311,"No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now."
46312,A round for all of my friends!
46313,"The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious..."
46315,"Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others."
46316,"Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women."
46319,"That I do. If you want to grab a pickaxe and dig up some iron, feel free. I'll pay for anything you bring me."
46322,"I made my fortune as a sea captain, but now I'm retired."
46323,I think I've got some mugs need scrubbin'.
46324,The marsh is treacherous. You would do well to not wander at night.
46325,"Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never."
46326, 
46328,"You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule."
46330,But you know what I mean!
46333,"How are things at the Meadery, my dear?"
46335,Keep looking. There's got to be some way to get that gate open.
46336,"Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time."
46338,Hrm.
46340,"Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... Mystery."
46343,"I know there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were responsible. I assure you this is not the case."
46344,"I should be asking you the same question, but all right. I'll cook. Here, try this, and don't you dare ask for another one before tomorrow."
46346,"I don't see why we should live as an underclass to the Nords. If anything, they owe us."
46347,"Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid."
46348,And then I told her about the vampires and how much they would pay me for her.
46350,I was astounded and in turn it lead to a conversation. Who'd have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?
46354,"Kodlak killed, Jorrvaskr attacked. How could this happen, within the walls of Whiterun?"
46356,I'll mark it down on your map.
46357,I expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near future... 
46358,"No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up."
46359,We both agree it's best to keep these matters in house.
46361,"Astrid, I've been hearing some, er... interesting things, from the others... about what you did when you left the Sanctuary last week..."
46362,"I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are."
46363,"You see, you're not well! Have a seat and I'll fetch you some tonic."
46367,"I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good."
46368,"Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary."
46370,I went on to teach at the College - left after two years. Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the Destruction school... 
46372,"When I was thirteen I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts. Completely."
46373,"You need my strength again, I'll be home."
46374,"Skjor was looking for you, earlier."
46377,"Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line."
46380,Was there anything else?
46381,No breaks for a good worker out here.
46382,"So you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did."
46386,"An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II."
46390,"Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect."
46392,"Not excited, no. Some very bad things happened here."
46393,I found a big load of ebony at the bottom pocket in the mine.
46394, 
46395,Move along.
46397,"Welcome, people of Solitude! We of the Bards College are pleased to be here to celebrate the Burning of King Olaf."
46401,Beyond these doors is the inner sanctum and the Skull of Corruption.
46402,Meet me at my quarters.
46404,Close the door.
46408,Does that cover everything?
46409,"Yes, I know Winterhold used to be full of my kind, and no I don't care that they're all gone now."
46410,What's going on?!
46411,I'll paint the snow with your blood!
46412,"But then Ulfric and his ""Sons of Skyrim"" started agitating about it, and sure enough the Emperor had to crack down."
46413,"I'll consider the offer, but I'll have to discuss it with the other caravans."
46415,"Hm. Yes, perhaps. A certain strength of spirit."
46418,You want Garvey. He handles the keys for the Warrens. About the only thing that disease-riddled native is good for.
46420,"It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well, erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad."
46422,You're going to the fort.
46423,"You need steel? Speak to my forge-wife, Gharol."
46424,"Well, hurry it up!"
46427,"Endon, dear, please don't.... Save your frustrations for work."
46430,Move along. Nothing to see here.
46431,"Next to the door, the room on the left."
46433,"Go to Markarth. There you'll find Calcelmo, wise, acid, and reclusive. Help him to emerge and state his intentions."
46434,Take my advice and keep away. You look too smart to get caught up with this bunch.
46440,"I can't take any more of this. No weapons, please. Let's just talk."
46443,Teach them to stop paying me.
46444,"When we go back to Largashbur we'll be kings. I like Narzulbur, but don't tell Mul."
46445,We have to get the Key back.
46446,Make me proud.
46450,I've been cleaning up spills and there is fresh linen for the rooms.
46452,"I catch you stealing anything, I'll break your neck."
46455,I'll see you at home.
46459,Gods... damn you!
46461,Yes.
46463,"No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn to give it to us."
46465,(bark)
46466,Hope I don't draw guard duty.
46467,This imperial armor is damn heavy.
46468,I'm a little busy at the moment. I've got all sorts of errands to run.
46469,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
46470,Did you hear that?
46472,"So it would appear. Though I'd suspect she'd want you to complete your other contracts first. Do those, then we'll talk about something new."
46473,"Shor's bones, I hope you're right."
46477,"We kill every Thalmor between us and Thorald, and we bring him out alive. Let's go."
46479,"What's the Legion doing here? Damn Imperial spies... Well, should be fun for us, at least. They don't seem to know we're here yet."
46480,I knew you looked like a clever one...
46481,Stay sharp.
46482,Were there tears? I hope everyone can see the bruises.
46485,A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!
46486,"That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your destination."
46492, 
46496,You need to leave.
46500,"Shadowmere, my old and dear friend..."
46501,"I might just be a servant among lords, but don't think for a moment I don't take my duties as seriously as the jarl himself takes his!"
46502,"Go, you're not wanted here."
46503,You need to leave now.
46505,It's time for you to go.
46507,May Kynareth's winds blow you to fortune.
46508,Damn it.
46510,I'd be grateful. Kolskeggr is my home.
46511,"For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both heavens and earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!"
46512,Please. Come in. Musn't talk in the Ratway.
46514,"You're going to get us all killed, you damn fool!"
46516,You're telling me.
46517,Maybe you should just move along.
46518,"Lady Haelga, so pleased to see you. Your Marks of Dibella are ready."
46520,Hm hmm.
46521,I'd be out there fighting the Imperials right now if it wasn't for my war-wound.
46527,"Hello, Jora. I'm glad to see you. In fact, I was just thinking about you and your husband."
46530,"Thanks, I was actually worried I'd run out."
46531,Use Dragonrend! It is the only chance to defeat him!
46533,Let see what adornments I might have available...
46535,"I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwarven Convector."
46536,Has my son Sven asked to join the war?
46538,Don't take anything for granted in life. Nothing lasts forever.
46544,I don't understand why General Tullius hasn't been recalled. The man is clearly incompetent. I have half a mind to tell him so myself.
46545,The sailors I know are plenty good at finding trouble without any help from you.
46546,You need a reliable horse in the Reach. That's what we have.
46548,"This skill should prove very useful, Dragonborn. Fighting fire with fire, as the saying goes."
46550,"I want to leave my high place, to seek shelter. From what, I don't yet know."
46551,"I never expected Ulfric to live up to his legend, but he does."
46552,"If you wish to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no one would give it a second thought."
46553,I'm going to put this back where it belongs. I'll never forget this. You've done a great thing for me and my sister.
46554,"First war, and now dragons. Everywhere they go, the Nords bring nothing but ruin."
46555,"Come slumming to the Gray Quarter, have you?"
46556,But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.
46557,"What is it with you and all these questions? Very well, ask away."
46558,He's the sorry bastard who's going to be executed.
46560,Go right ahead. He just might be sober enough to listen to you.
46564,All I'm asking is that you clean up once in a while. How you can find anything in your half of the place is beyond me.
46565,I'll have you know I can haul up just as much iron as you in a day and still manage to clean up my messes.
46566,"The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She goes by many names."
46569,There's plenty more work for the likes of you.
46570,I need someone that cares about me more than they care about themselves. That person isn't you.
46571,"For all we know, he's here to scout out the College. I'm sure they want to undermine our efforts."
46572,Back again? What is it this time?
46573,"Watch the skies, traveler."
46575,"I can't pay, I can't!"
46576,"Thanks to you, the people of Skyrim will continue to have a place to study magic. Even if most of them resent you for it."
46577,Thank you. It's nice to know someone admires me for more than just my appearance.
46578,"Ahhh.... gotcha! Oh, Listener, you should see the look on your face! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
46582,Unslaad hokoron! Never again!
46584,I'm a writer by trade. Not that the people of Skyrim do much reading.
46585,Good work. This was a double victory. We took a garrison away from the Stormcloaks and further proved the hollowness of their cause.
46587,Here you go. Your continued assistance to the cause is appreciated.
46590,You've already taken all the necessary steps in becoming eligible for the title.
46592,Well? Out with it.
46599,Seems like capturing Riften is turning out to be more of a hassle than a benefit. But what do I know?
46601,"Aye! We haven't forgotten Markarth, Tullius!"
46603,"None. It's been long enough that honestly, I don't expect to hear from them."
46607,That's fine scale armor you've got on there. Shiny.
46609,Guests are advised to remain inside the Embassy.
46612,Let me know if you want to try again.
46615,Hah!
46617,It must be secured. Ancano's actions prove that the world is not ready for such a thing.
46618,Stay out of trouble in my city.
46622,"You learn quickly, as only a Dragonborn can."
46623,Can't talk.... I'm outta' here.
46627,"Make your way up there and look for Olfrid. He says he's got a matter that requires a delicate touch, and I suggested you for the job."
46628,"And please, let's just... Let's keep this between us."
46630,"I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now, but please take this. And perhaps, if this is all successful..."
46634,"What? Oh, no. No, no. I need more time to research the dwarven machinery. Thank you for offering, though."
46636,I prayed to Mara and she spoke to me in a dream. She said a stranger would appear to help me.
46637,It is entirely possible that they look to our College here in Winterhold in order to find supporters for their organization.
46638,"I'm afraid you've been a little mis-informed. I have something of mine, that I was going to sell to Arniel."
46641,"Reburrus, I need you to draft a letter to Ulfric requesting more men."
46643,Backbiter.
46647,"I told Arniel what I wanted in exchange for it, and he was unwilling to come up with it."
46649,"It's nothing dangerous, so don't worry. I'm not even sure why he wants it, but then that's not really my concern. He's willing to pay for it."
46651,"Wonderful. I was afraid I'd have to give up, and when I'm so close..."
46652,"Aye, with a certainty."
46654,"The Greybeards are an amazing lot. Imagine, living your entire life without speaking to a friend or a loved one. I couldn't stand it."
46655,"Look, it's all very simple."
46657,There is much for J'zargo to be sure of.
46660,"Their disappearance, of course!"
46661,I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city.
46663,Which one is that again?
46664,"I see. So you don't remember fondling the statuary, then?"
46665,I suppose I could copy his style based on what you brought me but I have no idea what happened in between these verses.
46666,What could be worth studying about a long-lost civilization?
46671,"You, talk to egg-brothers. Deeja has no words for you."
46673,What? Someone will suffer for this injustice.
46675,"What, seriously? Come on, I thought that was funny!"
46678,"Hmm? No, no. No! I'm too close now. Can't take the time."
46680,"It's very particular, and very important."
46682,"The sooner you remember that, the better."
46683,"Well, yes. The designs for my Convector were based on real dwarven machines, so there may still be some in existence."
46684,Maybe you want to rethink what you're asking?
46685,"You must be new around here, or you'd know they don't let my kind live anywhere outside that slum."
46687,"But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?"
46689,"Now this spell is not for defending yourself, but it's just right for heating the Convector. At least three seconds' burn is necessary."
46690,I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.
46692,To the time after Oblivion opened.
46693,"Wish I could learn some of that charm. I'm just good with bows, not people."
46694,"Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?"
46695,"Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds."
46696,You won't get the best of me!
46701,Numinex was the dragon's name. That's his skull decorating the main hall.
46705,"Oh, by the Divines, you too?"
46707,"You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite."
46710,"You will? Really? Well, okay, here's the situation."
46713,What?
46716,"Igmund, we need to talk about the Silver-Blood family."
46720,You seek that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge.
46721,Maybe... hmm... what of the Greybeards? They are respected by all Nords. High Hrothgar is neutral territory.
46724,I find that highly unlikely... but the court will love it. I'm writing it in.
46725,"By the gods, the blood! The blood!"
46728,"Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting."
46729,"Please, you must set this right. I'm begging you."
46732,"The child is spirited, but lacks... agency. "
46733,"Oh, I've heard this one before. Watch out Divines, poor Kodrir curses you all for giving him life!"
46734,"You here to see the Jarl? No sudden moves, understand?"
46737,"If I'd known it was so important to him, I'd have charged him more."
46741,The thief had broken into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.
46742,"It was a simple task, so I didn't keep close tabs on it like I do with the dangerous stuff."
46743,"Sorry, no time. I'm late."
46745,"Don't get too flowery on me, lad."
46749,"Well, yes. Why wouldn't I be? Are you... interested in me?"
46750,Elenwen! This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.
46751,"They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect her against the Thalmor."
46754,Can't catch me!
46756,"When you get it, she's yours."
46757,"Masters Einarth, Borri, and Wulfgar will each demonstrate a Shout. Make your choice."
46758,"You're a very pretty young woman, Rhiada."
46759,"By Ysmir, this is horrible! I never wanted the girl dead, I swear!"
46760,No!
46761,"Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!"
46762,"Sir, you must tell her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!"
46764,All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her.
46765,Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive.
46766,"I hope you're enjoying yourself, ma'am."
46767,"I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir."
46770,I should have guessed.
46771,"Your payment, for a job well done."
46773,"Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after."
46781,"And believe me, I don't say that to everyone. I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form."
46783,Losing the Rift gives Tullius easy access to the south of Eastmarch. Talos preserve us. We must take it back!
46788,"The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by the Greybeards and then the Emperors."
46790,What is it?
46791,Did you see that serving girl? I hear elf women are insatiable...
46793,I'll never submit!
46803,"I know! I know! Just shut up and let me look, okay?"
46804,But only if you use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.
46806,"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier. I meant no disrespect."
46809,"Try as you may, they won't say ""good day,"" but will just walk away. Worry not, Morthal! Lurbuk is here to stay!"
46811,You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.
46812,"Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer."
46813,"Yes, Lady Ateia. My voice is strong as a Dragonborn's!"
46815,"Falion, I am disappointed."
46816,"We're going to install a garrison there, but first, your going to clean out the bandits that have moved in."
46820,The nearest modern incarnation of it is the strange rituals practiced by the Forsworn.
46821,Join the forces mustering outside of [CAPITAL]. (Infos conditioned on Capital location go here)
46822,I should have known this would end badly. I can't believe I let Delphine talk me into this.
46824,"Sondas, I've heard about Morrowind."
46826,"True, he turned traitor to Alduin and helped overthrow the Dragon Cult, but that does not excuse or expiate his previous deeds."
46830,"That fool son of mine, Erik, wants to be an adventurer. He a good-natured lad, but he's got no idea how dangerous the world really is."
46831,We've got to get out of here.
46837,"Are you sure? It's rightfully yours, but this money could go to getting better weapons and armor, and making repairs to the settlements we control."
46839,"Here's your pay. It's never enough for what we do, but war gives us warriors its own kind of benefits, doesn't it?"
46840,Damn Imperials. They won't hold Dawnstar forever.
46842,"Mama, where did papa go?"
46845,"Yes, I did. I shouldn't be the one to tell you about this. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. Believe me, he'll know."
46847,"The house is so... empty, Enmon... and quiet."
46848,Yes. I'm sure he's doing well there.
46849,"By Azura, it gets hot in there. I use Frost Salts for a potion to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out."
46850,Got an axe here. Good for cleaving up Forsworn.
46852,"I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well."
46854,"It was Aerin who found me dying outside of a Dwemer ruin. If he hadn't brought me here and nursed me back to health, I would have died."
46858,I'm starting to think...
46859,"Nasty business with that Ancano fellow. Pity that I was unable to assist, but I was... otherwise occupied."
46862,"Lots of nasty holes in the Reach, and Blind Cliff Cave is one of them. A filthy Hagraven nest, northeast of here."
46865,Remember Cloud Ruler Temple!
46867,"You need some armor, outlander?"
46869,"Not today. You should have come by earlier. Wait, didn't I sell me last one to you?"
46871,You don't look so good. Are you feeling all right?
46872,"Look at these figures, Thongvor! Ore yield is down by half, and the amount of silver bars being smelted is slipping even more than that."
46874,Don't have much to say to you. Got work.
46875,Damn right we do.
46876,"Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away."
46877,That one with the saddle? How much are you offering?
46878,Mining iron takes a lot of strength and special reinforced tools.
46879,Suppose so. Got one all saddled if you've got the coin.
46880,He died well.
46882,Thank the gods. Now let's deal with these other hunters. We hunt together!
46883,Wish everyone haggled like you. She's all yours.
46884,"Oh, and when you find Esbern... if you think I'm paranoid... you may have some trouble getting him to trust you."
46885,My husband Aesgir and I thank you for coming to our reception. We thank you for sharing the love we have for each other.
46886,You're making people a bit nervous. Should consider putting that weapon away. 
46890,"But if you insist, I suppose I'll be on my way. Thank you, and good luck."
46891,Obviously. You should visit the Bloodworks to talk to Wuunferth -- we need to figure out where the evidence went wrong.
46893,That's your best offer? I suppose so. She's the one with the saddle.
46894,Didn't think you had the coin.
46895,You must be new. We don't talk to each other here.
46896,"If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time."
46899,Let me see that!
46900,You've got a deal. It's the one with the saddle.
46903,"Oh, I can smell your blood..."
46904,Then what are you wasting my time for?
46905,"Morrowind used to be a lovely place, but you couldn't pay me to live there these days."
46906,Then stop wastin' my time.
46908,Have you lost your mind? I thought it was clear I didn't want anyone killed.
46909,"This is grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with again."
46910,"So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?"
46912,"Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him."
46914,"Trapping a dragon in Dragonsreach. Damn clever idea you had, I have to admit."
46915,All you've got to do is find and kill one lousy chef. The clock is ticking...
46916,"Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane. Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as his own."
46917,"The Empire exists because we allow it to exist, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that."
46918,I warned them against such a rash action. Even I could not foresee its consequences. Nust ni hon. They would not listen.
46920,Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.
46921,"You need a book, you talk to me. Otherwise you're going to find yourself in a lot of pain."
46923,"I dunno, Drahff. They'd skin us alive if they knew we were doin' this."
46930,"The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall."
46931,"Funny, I'd have thought she would've gone back to him by now."
46933,Aggghh...
46935,Good. And his Writ of Passage?
46938,"Here's your gold, with a little extra for hiding the body. Now go see Astrid. The final stage of the contract has come. The Emperor must fall."
46940,"You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. So there's that. And Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good."
46941,"When I heard Cicero screaming, I knew you'd been discovered. I feared the worst. Are you all right?"
46948,The cult's greatest accomplishment was the assassination of the Septim Dynasty and the opening of the Oblivion Gates.
46951,Thank you!
46953,And to think I was wandering the ash wastes only two years ago. I never knew my path would lead to you.
46956,Kodlak White-Mane is in a better place now. For is there any place better than Sovngarde?
46957,"If you're off to fight, talk to Beirand before you go. His armor is well forged and dependable."
46958,Talos created the Empire. You'd think they'd show him more respect.
46960,"Look. I gave you a contract, and you completed it. Barely. Now let's go back to you being insufferable, and me being... me."
46962,(screams)
46964,"He's from the battle, I just know it. He's one of Tiber Septim's soldiers... back from the dead."
46965,"Oh, we've got other things in mind for our mouths, sweetie."
46971,There's a... ghost. Just wandering around my inn like it owned the place.
46973,"Hmmmm... ""Fixed"" is such a subjective term. I think ""treated"" is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face."
46975,"I grew up in The Pale. This land was my home for most of my life... and for a Dunmer, that's quite a statement, I assure you."
46978,We don't just take in any milk drinker who stumbles in. Talk to Kodlak if you think you have what it takes to be a Companion.
46979,All he found in my pocket was a tiny smooth stone inscribed with some sort of strange runes.
46981,"Across the river to the northeast lies Yngol Barrow. Steer clear of that foul place, lest the walking dead claim you as their own."
46982,"It was my sister, Lilija. She served as a Battle Maiden with the Stormcloaks."
46985,I fought by your side. To take back the Reach from the savages.
46986,"At first I thought I'd miss farming. I guess I've had my fill of it, because I don't miss it at all."
46987,"All of a sudden, the ghost disappeared. What happened to it?"
46989,Do you think the ghost is one of... Tiber Septim's dead men?
46991,Look at them. The legendary sharpness of a deadric weapon. Marvelous.
46992,Don't you see? Elven supremacy is the only truth!
46993,Those Forsworn were fierce fighters. Fiercer than I could have imagined.
46994,"If you don't mind king, we'll just be taking that crown of yours and be on our way."
46996,"Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to my grave."
46997,The... the Gourmet?
46998,I'd simply like to talk to you.
47001,"Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc! He's staying at the Nightgate Inn. That's all I know!"
47002,I'll do my best.
47004,"No. Oh, please no..."
47007,So... we're done?
47008,Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.
47009,Surrender immediately or you both die.
47012,He's got to be here somewhere.
47013,Don't forget to speak to Jorn when you're ready for the festival.
47014,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
47015, 
47016,Easy there. I didn't mean nothing. Take it.
47018,As you were.
47019,"My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons."
47022,"I'll be damned, you did it!"
47023,I heard you're the reason we get to have this.  Thank you.
47024,"Jorn is the best of the bunch, you should hear him sing."
47027,"Bah. What's so good about it, hmm?"
47028,Come on! Light the fire!
47030,The joy of battle burns in your heart!
47031,I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine. 
47032,I thought the festival wasn't happening this year.
47033,Best batch of Spiced Wine I ever had.
47034,"Come talk to me after dark, we'll get the festival started when you do. "
47035,I'll tell everyone we're ready but we'll start the festival at dusk.
47036,Great. Looks like you'll be one of us soon.  We'll gather outside the College for the Burning of King Olaf.
47038,Nerevar guide me!
47040,"Ah, I see now. That would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic - but delicious - aftertaste. Simply brilliant."
47047,"It's tough, with just the two of us."
47049,"Good, my clients are gettin' impatient."
47052,Just say the word if you need a drink or something to eat.
47056,Too slow!
47058,"Ah, good. I've been waiting on that."
47059,"Ah, good. I've been waiting on that."
47060,Glad you're here.
47061,"You're alive! It was a gamble - but as Talos keeps us, we keep each other - I wasn't going to just let them rot in there."
47062,Murbul knows many poisons and cures if you need them.
47063,Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
47066,"Candlehearth Hall is running low on our famous mead. Can you drop off this case? The gold is yours, as always."
47067,You stupid cow. You don't know what you're missing.
47068,Another case of mead needs to find its way to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
47069,"Rhiada, did you clean the tables today? They're filthy!"
47074,Our chief is strong. That is all that matters.
47075,"But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a ""he."" Could be a woman for all we know."
47076,"Just remember, we take care of our own. Once you're in the Legion, you're in it for life."
47078,Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
47080,There's times I think you're the coldest man in Skyrim. This is your own flesh and blood you're talking about.
47081,"Here, take your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone."
47083,"Well at least now Mauhulakh has nothing to whine about. Until this one dies, too."
47086,"Don't let this innocent-looking flute fool you, for this is the Dancer's Pipe."
47089,I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....
47091,Nepos the Nose handles that part of our business. He has a way with the workers.
47092,Move it. Get to work. Get to work!
47093,"If Riften is the best Skyrim has to offer, I may as well turn back right now and just head for home."
47094,"So... now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?"
47095,Still need me to do something?
47097,"In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!"
47098,Humph. Some daughter you are.
47099,"I've gotten good at listening to keyholes. At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me."
47102,"I don't... I haven't mother's gift, not quite, but I've seen things."
47103,"You'll die this day, dragon!"
47106,"Did we really save the Empire? Or did we just plant the seeds for Ulfric's uprising, and another war?"
47110,Faith? I don't have faith in anyone.
47111,Now off with you! 
47114,"As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place."
47115,Very good. But you've created a debt between us. Here. Take this. We are even now.
47118,Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling?
47119,The strongholds keep to themselves. Skyrim hasn't always been kind to the Orcs.
47120,"My talents are much needed here, in order to keep Morthal... safe."
47121,"The most well known stronghold is Dushnikh Yal. Here, I'll mark it down for you."
47123,"I've already lost a family, and we're about to start a new one. I don't want that to happen again."
47126,Much knowledge lies within the College's walls.
47128,Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight. I'll find the release.
47129,"But going forward, I'm sure you realize that your fate is in your own hands. And the law can not be bent for personal friendships."
47130,"She's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse."
47131,"Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!"
47132,"No, no! This is the wrong way!"
47133,You must either be crazy or supremely confident to go walking around with no clothes on...
47134,"The other... Well, that can only be Labyrinthian."
47135,"You reek of death, my friend. I salute you."
47136,You're right. What would my forefathers think if they knew I wasn't paying my debts? Tell Haran I'll bring her the gold I owe.
47137,I think something's... wrong... I...  
47138,I'm not sure where else I'd go.
47139,Come on. Hurry it up already. The waiting is killing me.
47140,"Well yes, I did. And thank you so much for helping me."
47144,My boy fancies that Camilla Valerius. She'll come around soon enough.
47145,"So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind!"
47146,"That's General Tullius himself. He can't stand Elenwen, but she insists that he attend these parties. Just to piss him off, no doubt."
47150,Perhaps you should start at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.
47152,And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.
47153,"That was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real thing."
47154,It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.
47155,You have asked for my help. I am providing it.
47156,I am here to remind the ruling classes of Skyrim that their loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation with the Thalmor.
47157,Fine. I'll just keep all this coin for myself then.
47158,"Fortunately, those most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have now branded themselves traitors as well as heretics."
47160,There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their obligations to help root out the Talos heresy.
47161,Don't even give it a second thought. Maybe next time.
47162,"I'll bet this is better than trying to grow something in Morrowind, though, isn't it? "
47163,I've finally found you! I want to join the College of Winterhold. But I need help with my wards. Can you teach me?
47164,I'll try to forget you ever asked.
47168,"Oh, Asgeir! My husband! My dear, sweet husband! Why would someone do this to you? Why? This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life!"
47169,Just a taste!
47170,"Yes, this probably isn't really the place for your little jokes."
47171,I have given my answer. Go and reconsider your course.
47172,"Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the Thalmor, as you well know."
47173,Perfect. Melting this down will give me plenty of gold for those necklaces I started.
47177,This is neither the time nor place for such things. I'm surprised you would ask it of me.
47179,What do you think these devices were for?
47182,"If you're looking for truth instead, see Noster. He's a good example of what life has to offer."
47183,Noooooo!!!
47185,"No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything..."
47187,"He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know."
47188,"Mighty Thu'um, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Dragonborn issued his roar!"
47189,And his name is...?
47190,I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred-
47192,Ahhhh!
47193,You know the rules. Just answer the questions.
47194,And where can we find this nameless old man?
47195,Ah. Uh. Of course I'm not just rising. You must have been out when I woke up.
47198,"What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where-"
47199,"Silence, prisoner!"
47200,"Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
47204,"No idea, but whatever he did it must have angered Maven. No guard would lock up a Black-Briar without the old lady's permission."
47205,Hey! You're the one that hurt me!
47206,He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west.
47207,"Viarmo, don't you think it's time that the Bards College officially declared support for the empire?"
47208,"Ah, and let me guess. He wants his horse. Well, that's going to be a bit of a problem. You see, I don't really outright ""own"" Frost..."
47211,Your pockets... they're a little low on coin. I can tell.
47213,"Still, I don't want to cross Letrush. Tell you what. Steal the horse and deliver it, and you can have the second half of the payment."
47216,"My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned..."
47217,"That is correct. You see, Frost belongs to the Black-Briar estate. Technically everything in the estate is owned by my mother, Maven."
47219,Then I think we're done talking.
47222,Get the coat. Then we'll talk.
47223,Good to meet a prospective Bard.
47225,We should have the festival soon.
47227,I still don't know if rewriting the verse is going to work.
47230,Good job! I knew I gave the mission to the right person.
47231,Here's your share of their reward.
47233,Anything to break the boredom of living in this town. I envy you.
47234,I heard they live their entire life without uttering a single word; can you even imagine?
47235,"I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?"
47236,"Not hot enough. Does your Skyrim ever get warm, husband?"
47237,"S'rendarr be merciful! What ill fortune that this should happen now, while we are trying to make a living."
47238,Brynjolf will provide you with the details.
47239,I just try to keep out of the way when they start roughhousing.
47240,Always thought it was odd that there's a layer of thick clouds covering the peak of the mountain above the monastery.
47241,"The Greybeards stay away from me, and I stay away from them. Suits me just fine."
47242,What do you make of that?
47243,Come back to me when you have something useful.
47244,"Sometimes I swear I can hear strange noises rolling down from up there. It sounds like thunder, but there's never any rain."
47245,What happened?
47246,"Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them."
47247,Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it.
47248,"I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to."
47250,"We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed."
47255,I think you should continue with your performances.
47259,See that you don't. I promised to keep you safe and I'm not going to break my word.
47261,Have you spoken to Fastred yet?
47262,But this is supposed to be your work. 
47263,Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.
47264,A citizen of Eastmarch has asked for our help.
47265,"Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One way or another, we don't want the pests coming back."
47266,"You have no idea what it's like to have everything, then watch it all disappear."
47268,"Another round, on me!"
47269,"And here you go... your payment, just as I promised."
47272,"I know, but I don't want to let them down. I guess I better start thinking about it soon."
47274,I thought you played wonderfully last night.
47275,"If I had anything worth giving, I'd have offered it already."
47276,"Perhaps when you're finished here this evening, we could..."
47278,"If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir at the stables."
47279,I heard Temba yelling at you yesterday. Why do you let her treat you like that?
47280,"If you'll pardon the expression, she's far more bark than bite."
47281,"Perhaps, but abuse is abuse. I don't think I could stand it."
47282,Amazed isn't the right word. They might find this... offensive.
47283,"There's much more to worry about in life then a bit of a temper, my friend."
47284,It's been a number of years since I've set foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track.
47286,And so you shall be tested.
47287,What is it now?
47288,But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore.
47289,There's still plenty of ore left in that mine. What a waste.
47291,"I know what you said, but I only wanted to speak to him for a moment."
47294,You have to let Fastred follow her heart. You can't tell her what to do.
47296,"Verner, you should have come out with me yesterday. I found the most amazing tree growing right out of a cave."
47297,You're hardly throwing her to the wolves. She just wants to see the world... just like I did when I was her age.
47298,Mind what - or who - you practice this on.
47300,"I help, I do the chores. What else would you have me do?"
47303,We're behind again. I need you to catch another two bushels by week's end if I'm to make another delivery.
47305,"Blood from a stone, Klimmek. I've been out there every morning. They just aren't biting."
47310,"If you have a moment, I've come up with a few ideas I wanted to share."
47313,Everything was going great in Redbelly. Then the damn spiders showed up.
47314,"Look, I'm merely suggesting a few things that could expand our business."
47315,As for where to find it... such blasphemies have always been the stock in trade of the mages of Winterhold.
47316,"""Our"" business?"
47317,You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon. He is beyond our strength.
47319,Gwilin! I told you to cut those boards at twice arm length! My arm's length. Not yours.
47320,I should say so.
47322,I'm so sorry Miss Temba. Perhaps if you would have been more specific...
47323,What can I get you?
47324,I'm afraid I don't have a primary contract for you yet.
47325,"Sorry, Miss Temba."
47326,Skjor was looking for you before. Talk to him before doing anything else.
47330,That can be arranged.
47331,"Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from his body, and make it an offering to me."
47333,I have a competitor called Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business.
47334,We will speak more.
47336, 
47338,I'm so glad you succeeded. Here. Please take this for your trouble.
47340,Talos smite you!
47344,Strangers like you bring war. I've seen enough war.
47345,Look at that.
47347,Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...
47350,Thanks for bringing the claw back.
47354, 
47355,Going to enjoy killing you!
47358,"They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect him against the Thalmor."
47361,"My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor."
47362,"I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe."
47363,"Not often, no."
47366,"New here too, eh? I'd hoped I wouldn't be the only Nord, but I should've known better."
47367,"I would like you to take an item of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos."
47368,"No offense, of course."
47369,"Well, there's an Imbuer in the Great Hall."
47372,"So, you're the new recruit, eh?"
47373,Don't let your guard down.
47375,Dragon?
47376,"Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even."
47379,What a marvel of engineering. The ancient Nords were ingenious builders.
47381,The Silver-Bloods have made you a very generous offer for this pile of dirt. I suggest you take it.
47382,Never thought I'd see you again.
47384,"Well, what the hell is Mercer going to do about this mess? Have you even talked to him?"
47386,We should not be talking about that.
47390,I'll shatter your bones like glass!
47391,"Those dreams are not just visions, they're a footprint left by the Daedric Lord Vaermina as she drains these people of their memories!"
47392,We should be careful. There's no telling what traps and wards the ancient Blades may have set.
47397,"I understand. If you should change your mind, I'll be here."
47398,"Well met. Unlike my brother, I've no dislike of strangers. Met lots of 'em while I was a Stormcloak."
47399,"...and I said to the baker, ""You're not dead! You're a faker!"" But if that's your wish, I'll oblige..."
47401,"I heard you sneaking around downstairs last night. Were you trying to break into my chest again, son? I've told you to leave it alone."
47403,"But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing."
47404,You take that book to General Tullius or Ulfric and let them have their little triumph. It will be delivered back here to me soon enough.
47405,Damn right!
47406,We do this for the good of Skyrim and her people. Never forget that.
47407,How much worse is this going to get?
47408,"Yes! How'd you get this? Never mind, here. It's not much, but its something. "
47410,They say dragons are coming back. I want to kill one!
47411,"Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you are."
47412,"It'll take years, but I'll organize the Forsworn again. We'll reclaim our land, and then, when power is ours, we'll have peace. A kingdom."
47414,"Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing."
47415,I'm listening.
47416,Of course! I mean... assuming you don't want me to kill someone for you. I might have to draw the line there.
47417,So what's your story?
47418,"Oh? Something interesting, I hope?"
47419,Did you know that most of Winterhold fell into the sea? I heard it's because of that College.
47423,"I'm going to be a silversmith one day, like my mother and father."
47425,"Say on, friend. What do you need?"
47426,My ears are always open to a friend's request.
47427,"I showed up to watch, yeah."
47431,Glory awaits!
47432,That's it? Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually end up making a fool out of myself without even trying.
47433,"I don't even want to know, do I? But for you... all right. I'll do it."
47434,"I don't know... I don't want to do anything that might offend Elenwen. There is a lot of money at stake, after all."
47435,That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
47438,"He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim."
47439,How dare you! You disgusting pig!
47443,"Well, well. I was looking for this little beauty."
47444,"Adelaisa, I'm sorry."
47447,"Hey, Razelan, remember when you told me I'd never amount to anything?"
47448,"It's all for a good cause, old chap."
47449,Who would like to open the negotiations?
47450,"Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your eyes! Get away, get away from me!"
47451,"No harm is meant to you, happy fool."
47457,"You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!"
47460,"Yes, papa."
47464,You're a disgrace to the Empire. To think that you're actually the representative of the East Empire Company.
47465,"The head office will hear of this, Razelan! You're a disgrace to the East Empire Company, and to the Empire itself!"
47466,"What is it, Elf?"
47467,Soon. I'm not exactly sure when. But not to worry - the ceremony itself is being followed up by a public banquet that will last for several days.
47468,I don't think anyone deserves that kind of abuse! I've known plenty of elves who were perfectly decent people.
47471,"Me? No, I'm too important to the war effort to risk life and limb in there... Besides, that's what I'm paying you for."
47472,There's no excuse for your behavior!
47473,"Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!"
47474,"All right, all right. Have it your way. Tell Octieve to forget about the debt."
47475,I can't go near his body. Would you get it back for me?
47476,Where are you... get me down from this!
47477,Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time.
47478,Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.
47480,"Yes, Madame Ambassador."
47481,What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?
47482,"Well, now. There's no need to ruin the party on my account. I don't think he'll be bothering me again."
47483,"I'm sure he'll behave himself for the rest of the evening, won't you dear?"
47486,"Oh, Ambassador Elenwen, that won't be necessary. It is just Razelan, after all."
47488,A method to your madness and your madness is the method and the melody...
47489,"Sorry, but I'm not looking to hire any more crew right now."
47491,"Oh... I'm afraid I may have overreacted. Please, I've already forgotten whatever it was he said to me."
47492,"Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's no harm in him. Please, let him go."
47494,"Please, make sure Winterhold is safe!"
47495,Tell your men to stand down. I don't need any help dealing with this kind of fool. He isn't worth the trouble.
47496,"What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I would never openly insult your... that is to say..."
47498,"What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I don't mean to say I wouldn't be interested... what I mean is..."
47499,"Hmm? Did you say snakes? Where? I hate them, always slithering they way they do... what? Are they on me?"
47500,I'll always have fruit to buy. Until it goes rotten. Then... I won't.
47501,Ah!
47504,"I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could."
47505,The only way to get things done in this city is to keep your head down and pay off the right people.
47506,Let me see that!
47509,"That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What... I don't understand why everyone... never mind."
47510,Tell you what. You start running so I can stab you in the back.
47511,"Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman!"
47512,"Do you think the Forsworn will come here? I mean, if they attacked Kolskeggr...."
47515,That it is. Good to be home. Let me know if you dig up any ore. We'll pay a fair wage.
47516,He's a stubborn oaf. I don't know what good it'll do.
47517,"Skaggi is in charge, not me."
47520,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
47524,"A small container, made of the magically infused snow that first fell on the Throat of the World."
47528,I don't suppose you're going to buy something this time?
47529,"Sure, sure. I'm a dirty beggar... why would you want to even speak to me."
47531,"If Ulfric needs a favor, he has it. Anyone else better pay well for the service."
47532,Urog is a good learner. I'm glad I have the chance to teach her. Makes me not miss the woods as much.
47533,Thanks for clearing out that vampire nest. You saved Morthal.
47534,Because I have no wish to be harmed.
47535,"You're in my home. That's right. This here place, Breezehome, it belongs to old Terek."
47536,"What do you want, new blood?"
47538,"Please, we need to speak in private."
47542,You look sick. I hope it's not contagious.
47543,"I've been here 50 years, and nothing is going to move me off my land."
47544,What kind of question is that? Look at me! Is this a young man's face?
47545,"You watch the market, you hear the rumors around Riften. What have you heard about these dragons?"
47546,Yah!
47547,Well... perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises.
47548,Silence!
47549,No! Don't leave me here! I beg you to let me out!
47550,You... you go first.
47551,Oh my. That...
47553,"With me, you kill Skyrim's last hope. Mark my words. You'll all be serving elven masters soon. And know then, that I would have stopped them."
47555,What are you waiting for? Do it!
47556,I'm ready. I made my peace with the gods long ago.
47557,Oh ho! What's with the weapon? Looks like it's about to get rough in here. 
47558,"To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there out there."
47559,"Jarl Balgruuf? He rules Whiterun Hold. A good man, perhaps a bit over-cautious, but these are dangerous times."
47562,They're fearsome!
47563,Troll's blood was he a tough one!
47564,Here we go!
47565,Not that there's anything that can be done about it. He's in good with the Thieves Guild.
47567,"If you come across any Imperials in your travels, I expect you'll know what to do."
47568,Get a bad feeling.
47570,See that it doesn't happen again.
47571,"Please, help Yamarz. Do whatever you can. Our tribe depends on you."
47572,"Hopefully, that story about Lenne's Shield is true."
47575,"Relax, Marise... I have no quarrel with you. I just wish to speak a moment."
47577,"Hold, on there. I think I just remembered something. The last time we handed out pay."
47578,Get out of here!
47579,Not now! It's time to get back at these crows.
47580,"If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the hills."
47589,Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.
47590,"Damned good shooting, boys!"
47591,"The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the elves soon enough."
47595,Why did I ever come here?
47596,"But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting like it. There's much to do. The new Jarls need help building armies, and enforcing their right to rule."
47597,"No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be better for all that way."
47599,Life's hard enough with all these men propositioning me. But that bard is the worst.
47600,You throw a mean hook.
47601,"By the gods, that man nearly killed me. You saved my life."
47602,"It seems that the gods have grown tired of us. They've left us to our fate, as the plaything of Alduin the World-Eater."
47604,Suit yourself.
47605,"Ah, err, yes. Sorry."
47607,You don't belong here. What do you think you have to offer?
47608,"Runnin' an inn weren't my plan. But Falion decided to move here, so I joined him."
47609,"I may understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best."
47610,The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments.
47613,"No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years."
47614,The Jarl of Winterhold has asked for our help.
47616,It's only a matter of time before their pointy ears start itching to rule the world again.
47617,"And that's as it should be. In the darkest days ahead, it'll be us Nords who lead the fight against the elves."
47618,"Peace? When has any Nord ever known peace? Skyrim breeds warriors. It's who we are, it's in our blood."
47622,"By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Kin to the Orcs. Let it be known among the strongholds that you are family, now."
47623,"The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see. "
47627,"Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose."
47628,And they should enjoy it while they can... I suspect all of Tamriel will again be called to arms in the not too distant future.
47629,"The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to have their families return home."
47630,"There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to fight us, and bring misery to the people... but they are few in number."
47632,Sir.
47633,"How pathetic, being forced to eke out a miserable existence in a place like this."
47635,"Oh, no. Err, wouldn't do to say at all. Not, err, not now. Not at all. I have far too many things to do still."
47636,Although I fear the Jarl may not be easy to persuade.
47638,Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just the same.
47641,Put on some damn clothes already!
47643,"Ignore me all you want, you still aren't getting in."
47644,Have you decided if I can head up to Solitude yet? I hear it's the best place to meet someone who may be willing to teach me to paint.
47645,Too much magic can be dangerous. M'aiq once had two spells and burned his sweetroll. 
47650,"Hey, you're not supposed to be down here. Official business only."
47651,"I don't know, but he sounded impatient."
47652,They just want to be sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.
47653,"Sure, that'll do just fine. Go on ahead."
47654,Bloody tourists.
47656,"Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion."
47657,I've been in Skyrim my whole life. Why would I want to leave?
47661,Father says I ain't smart enough to be stablemaster. Some day.
47663,"Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim."
47664,"Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot."
47668,"I'll see you at Northwatch Keep, friend."
47671,Well come back when you earn some more so I can take it from you!
47673,I'll be fine. I just need a minute to catch my breath. Find Savos...
47674,Good news. I found that dwarven hammer you were looking for.
47676,"All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either."
47679,"I don't blame you. If I were in your shoes, I'd chicken out too."
47681,Just let me know when you're ready.
47685,Unbelievable! You have done us a great service here. I can't begin to thank you enough.
47686,"To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there."
47688,"Horses are my whole life. Back in Hammerfell, I helped my family raise horses at our farm."
47691,Mother thought I should be taught a lesson for airing the family's dirty laundry in public.
47697,"Oh come now, resorting to petty tricks are we?"
47698,"This is a great service you've done for me, Harbinger. I will not soon forget."
47699,Well done! Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften.
47700,"I would if I could, but I can barely make ends meet."
47701,"I thank you for your help, my friend."
47702,I told you everything I know. What else did you want?
47705,"Look, if I was a little harsh before, I just wanted you to know it's because you were new. Know what I mean?"
47706,I think I've said enough. Now leave me alone.
47707,"Oh Hroggar, you know I'm always hungry. Don't worry, I'll eat when I need to."
47708,"Trader dropped by recently with some lovely pieces, if you'd like to have a look."
47710,You must feel the Word within yourself.
47711,Steady. Let's see what it does.
47713,Let me guess - someone stole your sweetroll...
47716,I didn't do it! You saw! I didn't do it!
47717,"Much like Mjoll, you've become champion of our hold; helping people with their difficulties and providing assistance for their needs."
47718,Doesn't matter... the title is yours. I henceforth name you Thane of Riften. Don't disappoint me.
47719,"At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough."
47721,Yes? What do you need?
47722,"As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open the door."
47723,"I'm sorry you disapprove, father. But I've made up my mind. I'm not a warrior, I'm a businessman."
47727,Don't mind me. I'm perfectly insensible to the cold.
47729,Therefore all that remains is to bestow it upon you.
47731,"You, place that hammer on the shrine. You're the only one who's proven worthy in all of this..."
47733,Secure the door.
47736,Ulfric Stormcloak! 
47737,"Not while I'm still breathing, it's not."
47738,Step aside Galmar. We're here to accept Ulfric's surrender. 
47739,Ah! What did you do? Stop that!
47740,"True, I may look the part of dashing swordsman, but I prefer the art of wit to that of warfare."
47742,Well would you look at that!
47743,I don't want to talk about it.
47744,"So you're telling me you and Sam just sent me in there to die, then? I want my money, you bastard."
47745,Any last requests before I send you to... to wherever you people go when you die.
47746,Sovngarde... sir.
47747,"That much? I mean, of course. If that's all you've got."
47748,With good planning and constant vigilance.
47749,The only thing keeping me from having you killed is Brynjolf. He's stepped in and made amends.
47750,Talos be with you...
47751,"What was that, Legate?"
47752,The Jarl of Haafingar has asked for our help.
47755,"Well, the men will be expecting some kind of speech. "
47756,Windhelm will need a government quickly if we are to prevent more violence.
47757,"Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lass. Wealth is my business."
47758,"If you need a good rumor or two, I think I can oblige..."
47759,"Brunwulf. Yes, I've sent men to protect him and bring him here. "
47761,The Legion will be staying here for quite some time. I don't expect there to be any further violence.
47762,"Husband, you worry far too much. We are within an hour's walk of Riften."
47763,The rebellion is over. Ulfric Stormcloak is dead. 
47767,"And indeed, there are many that call me hero."
47769,Many of you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here. 
47770,"Don't worry, though. Ulfric is our rightful High King. He'll drive out the Empire and Skyrim will have peace at last."
47772,"In appreciation for your exemplary service, I am doubling your pay and compensation to the widows of your fallen comrades."
47774,I hate giving speeches.
47775,It wasn't so bad.
47777,I hope we haven't just created a martyr.
47778,Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything?
47780,They'll no doubt strike whenever and wherever they can. 
47781,"Ah good, I could use some practice!"
47782,"Come, Rikke. There's still much to be done."
47784,"For someone called the ""Listener,"" you do an awful lot of shouting..."
47785,But we don't get any shipments in. Forsworn attack every caravan. So all I do is sit here and drink.
47786,I'm going to Movarth's Lair to kill that monster. Are you with me?
47787,"You're right, I forget myself. I've lived without hope for so long..."
47789,"Look, I don't want to get in another brawl with you."
47790,Arnleif and Sons Trading Company. I'm a porter. Just some muscle hired to move heavy packages.
47793,"If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband."
47796,"Don't sass me, little girl."
47799,I remember you... you were with us at Helgen. I heard you joined us. Welcome to the Stormcloaks!
47801,We shout.
47807,"Perhaps, perhaps. I'm not quite sure what I need."
47809,"Come on, I want a better look at that thing."
47811,"They say the Greybeards taught it to ignore the sun, and heat simply washes over it."
47812,"Don't leave me, for Arkay's sake!"
47813,I'm fully aware of the terms of our... arrangement.
47815,Not all can hear the broad echoes of deepest dawn. 
47816,Have you gotten the items I requested from you?
47819,"More importantly, upon your death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one of its guardians."
47821,Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your resolve.
47823,This is unfair! I'm innocent!
47824,How is your hunting with Yatul?
47828,"Look alive, will you!"
47829,I wanted to give you this. A token of my appreciation.
47830,Woodcutting's my trade. Best log splitter from here to Riften.
47833,"You know how to throw a punch, I'll give you that."
47834,Maybe you're looking for something... particular?
47835,"Next time you speak to him, tell him to clean up his own messes. I'm not about to jeopardize this position for a bunch of low-life thugs."
47836,"I'm sure it will wear off soon. When it does, you'll be perfectly fine, and then we can try again."
47839,"Embrace order and hard truth, mortal. Good bye."
47842,"I can't thank you enough, friend. I'll hope you'll come back to Rorikstead soon and pay me a visit."
47843,Damn dustmen!
47845,Can't blame you for having better things to do than help some farmer you don't know.
47846,"Oh... perhaps not, then. I don't think the Jarl of Solitude should be participating in a childish prank."
47847,Come on!
47848,Up in that tower! Quick!
47850,"Well, if you change your mind, I'd still like your help."
47854,"All right, then. Let's put that to the test."
47855,Part of the cost of peace. Emperor Titus Mede saved his Empire at a very high price. A price that included the Blades.
47856,"Listen, we're friends, right?"
47859,"I try not to think of her, but sometimes the simplest thing will remind me."
47861,It's about Ranmir.
47862,It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't said.
47863,Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here.
47866,"Ah. Well, some other time, perhaps."
47868,Come again?
47871,I used to travel so much before all this Forsworn nonsense. Such an inconvenience...
47873,"I'll be here if you need me, love."
47874,Back to my errands.
47880,I have no words. Talk to Anwen.
47881,Your objective is Fort Snowhawk.
47887,"Boys, girls, dogs, elders - there's nobody I won't fight!"
47888,"Oh, don't give me that look. Fine. I supposed I can find some menial task to set your mind on. Hmm...."
47892,"Come to think of it, I know of a win-win situation for both of us."
47893,Ah. Of course. Not everyone has an appreciation for the artistic wonders of the world.
47895,Hope Pavo will be able to go back to his mine soon. Everyone needs a home.
47901,Don't you dare. Ever.
47902,Really?
47903,I beg your pardon?
47905,Making weapons and armor isn't like making nails at all.
47908,Let's take our time. I think we can sneak by her if we're careful.
47911,"Die, little elf!"
47918,A what?
47921,"This... This is really from her, isn't it?"
47922,"I've never heard of anything like that. Did you ask Tolfdir? He's been here a long time, and seems to know almost everything."
47923,Did she really run off and do this? For me?
47924,"By the Eight. She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault."
47925,I see you but I don't see Frost. Come back when you have the horse with you.
47927,Oh really? Well you can tell them that I will be putting in a request for a few dresses quite soon.
47930,You. Who are you to approach the Jarl of Markarth?
47934,"You sure took care of that dragon. Dragonborn or not, that's good enough for me."
47936,Do you?
47940,The only thing we need to discuss is how many men it'll take to flush them out of the hills.
47941,"It's not that simple, Igmund. There are reports of Forsworn here in the city."
47943,Make us proud.
47944,I don't blame you.
47946,All will happen as it has been foretold.
47947,As you wish.
47950,Good!
47952,Large diagonal cut from left shoulder...
47953,Another one. Terrible.
47954,"Is something wrong. ""Is something wrong?"" she asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!"
47955,Talos save us! It's a dragon!
47956,This is a shame.
47964,Karliah and I were like partners. I went with her on every heist. We watched each other's backs.
47965,Return the gloves to me when you have finished.
47966,"Look at you, almost a grown man! Won't be long before you'll be joining the fight yourself."
47968,I have taught the Way of the Voice for centuries and the Thu'um since long before that.
47970,"With a single snap of her fingers, we could have a legion here in a fortnight."
47971,Last thing the Black-Briars need is some stranger stickin' their nose where it doesn't belong.
47972,"Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to let him have it."
47974,All it would take is a small force of guard to go into the Ratway and flush them out.
47975,Last thing the Black-Briars need around here is some troublemaker tryin' to steal a piece of the action.
47976,"If only I could be free of the mundane, day-to-day activities life so often requires."
47977,"If anything pleases the eye, don't hesitate to make me an offer."
47980,All I'm saying is Indaryn's going to push someone too far one day and they're going to push back... hard.
47981,You better watch your ass around here.
47982,Please! Release me! Cut my bonds!
47987,Ha ha! Don't make me laugh.
47988,"I am busy keeping this family in coin and your pretty little head adorned with jewels, so I'll thank you not to question where I go at night, wife."
47989,I'll be at the docks if you change your mind.
47991,Suit yourself.
47992,Then leave.
47995,"Dagur never heard any of this, and I chose to keep it to myself. I'm only telling you so you don't get into trouble."
47997,Stay out of the Black-Briars' business and you'll live longer.
47998,"With my swords in their hands, Ulfric's men will send those legion dogs running."
47999,"Are you a soldier? One day, I'm going to be a soldier!"
48000,"Get in good with Brynjolf, then we'll talk."
48001,Look... Now's not a good time...
48003,"Haming, you need to get over here. Now!"
48005,"Dirge told me you made it into the Guild. You need dirt on anything, you talk to me."
48006,"Just remember, if she tells you to do somethin'... you damn well better do exactly what she says."
48007,"If you want to get in on that action, find Brynjolf in the marketplace. I'm sure he could use someone like you."
48008,"Urog and Dushnamub were such lovely children. I held them as they watched their mothers die after birth. They know me best, now."
48009,That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
48011,Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar.
48014,How could you do that to me!
48016,You liar!
48017,"Fire, frost, or lightning - you will suffer at my hands!"
48020,It's crazy to still be working here. What if there's more draugr down there?
48021,"I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple."
48023,Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here. Trying to evade Hircine. 
48027,"I understand, mother. Forgive me."
48028,"They say... well, they say he murdered someone. Something to do with Svidi."
48029,"Come to think of it, I haven't seen Svidi in a while. Wait... he didn't..."
48030,I've told the captain of the guard we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here any minute.
48031,Bryling owns this mine. I wouldn't have much to live for if she hadn't offered me a job.
48033,"Ah, Bolli finally got someone out here. Well it's about time. I've been waiting for weeks."
48036,"You have a kind heart; much too kind for Riften. Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine."
48037,"Hey, greenskin... close your mouth. Some of us are trying to eat over here."
48039,"You're not going to goad me into a fight so I'll get kicked out, Grelka. Eat your food and leave me in peace."
48040,"Hello, hello, hello. Interested in fighting in the Pit? The rules are strict, but if I don't see it, it didn't happen, know what I mean?"
48044,Maybe it's time you quit then.
48045,Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum.
48046,Listener. I am your only salvation. Come. Embrace me.
48048,Good honest work staves off the cold.
48049,Backup! I need some help in here!
48051,"I've heard some things about Ulfric I don't like, but he's right about this war and about Skyrim's future."
48052,"She's already come down hard on us for missing shipments. Likely to do it again, since we're late."
48054,"Yes, my Jarl."
48056,Did he now?
48057,"I hope in his next life, he's reborn as an Argonian forced to live in a slum because of some bigoted Nord dictator."
48058,But that's not the point.
48062,"Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece!"
48063,"Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family since I was a child. I trust the man with my life.  "
48064,You could take word to her that there'll be a shipment soon. Buy us some time and keep her off our backs.
48065,The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer.
48069,I'm sure she'll be angry. Brace yourself.
48070,Then I'll see you at home!
48077,Won't be 'some other time' at this rate.
48079,Is everything all right? I've not heard from Sorli or Pactur in some time.
48081,Of course. Your training isn't complete yet.
48082,Kaan!
48083,We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.
48084,What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!
48087,"When I was young, I'd journey with my father on hunting expeditions into Morrowind. The cliff racers made for excellent sport."
48092,"Hmmm, you again. What is it this time?"
48094,"When you're hungry, you'll look anywhere for food. Can't blame her."
48099,We're the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion. Saviors of Mer. Victors of the Great War.
48101,"Let me see... ah, yes. This is the Wheelstone. It's an heirloom symbol of the power of Windhelm. "
48102,The Forsworn know every stone in the Reach. We have to wait them out.
48105,I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of Skyrim. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city.
48106,The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
48107,Dragonborn!
48109,"Oh, excellent. I'll see that it gets where it needs to go."
48112,"I hope the hunting goes well, brother. We've got the cowards on their heels now."
48113,"Ah, there we have it. This will be all I need to have Ogmund taken care of. "
48117,"I don't know about the end of the world, but this dragon situation has gotten out of hand."
48122,"Hey, high elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
48123,What have I done for the gods to take me so far from my beloved Daggerfall?
48130,"You wish to learn from the best, eh? So be it."
48131,Have you met her? She runs the forge near the smelter. Just don't bother talking to her apprentice. Boy has no talent.
48134,"You get me a heart, I get you some armor. Interested?"
48136,The World-Eater waits within the mist! Bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!
48138,"If you want some heavy armor, I might have a deal we could work out. I need a Daedra's Heart. Jarl wants me to cool his new sword in blood."
48139,"Depends on what you need. A light armor is good for travel. Less to carry. A heavy armor weighs you down, but no true warrior goes without it."
48141,Should have known better than to swim all the way to the falls. 
48145,You look like a traveler. Someone that has seen far away places and heard new stories.
48146,Just... stay back.
48147,"Well, your ill fortune means I have no mother."
48148,I work the forge.
48153,But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.
48154,Have you found something?
48157,Keep it away from me!
48160,"Paarthurnax. The dragon, that the Greybeards have been protecting for all these years."
48161,Gourmet? Why I... Um...  
48162,"Hello? Hello? Ah, I know you're listening."
48166,Stand back and watch a true professional wreck a party.
48167,"I just need to rest a moment, right here on this lovely rock."
48168,Please. You first. I insist.
48171,"I'm a bard, trained at the Bards College in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying."
48173,(Clapping.)
48175,"Ha. We admire your fighting spirit, Orc-Kin. You'll fit right in here. Come inside."
48176,"Surprised? So was I, when a member of your ""Family"" came to me with the plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange."
48177,"But you know what? I've changed my mind. How about this? I kill you, and butcher each and every one of your miserable little friends?"
48179,"Huzrah nu, kul do od, wah aan bok lingrah vod, Aahrk fin tey, boziik fun, do fin gein!"
48182,Kill him. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
48183,"I want to be clean, like he was, and go to Sovngarde when I finally die."
48184,Stop that! Keep your spells to yourself.
48186,My daughter Fjotli... she was murdered a few months ago. Left her laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood.
48187,"Bye, now."
48189,"Here we are. Gods, I'm nervous. We'll go in in just a moment. Please, I'll serve. You just stand there and... be amazing."
48190,"Ah, the Potage le Magnifique. So delicious. My friends, as Emperor, I of course reserve the right of first taste."
48191,"Master Einarth will now teach you ""Ro,"" the second Word in Unrelenting Force."
48192,(Laughing.)
48193,"We walk, then."
48194,I once saw Steirod tear a whole tree out the ground with his bare hands. Glad he's on our side!
48195,"Folks have gone missing the past few weeks. Word now's that our hunters are gone, too."
48196,"All right, but hurry. Who knows if Azura is watching us?"
48197,By the gods! The Gourmet and the chef have poisoned the Emperor! Get them!
48198,By the gods! The Gourmet has killed the Emperor! Attack!
48200,(Deep breath)
48201,I bet my papa could have beat you up. He was stronger than anyone.
48202,Looking for work?
48204,"Good day, Grelka."
48205,"What's so good about it? I've got deadbeats who don't pay me, the city guard looking over my shoulder and Maven Black-Briar breathing down my neck."
48206,"We were sure we'd find it all here, hidden away from time. Power, knowledge... All the things we didn't want to wait for."
48207,"Religion isn't going to save me. So unless Mara is going to start raining coin from the heavens, why don't you mind your own business."
48208,"Will she swear fealty to me, so all may know that we are at peace, and a new day has dawned? "
48210,Don't hurt me! You win.
48211,You've proven reliable. There's a group of bandits in my Hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with.
48215,"Well, we had one go missing from the Pawned Prawn, and I was just wondering..."
48216,There is a Thieves Guild in town you know.
48217,"Mirabelle is dead, and they're losing ground fast. I'd be there now if I hadn't seen... I had one of your 'visions', I think."
48218,"Oh I get it. ""It's missing so Grelka must have it."" I wish this town would stop pointing their fingers at me."
48220,"Oh, Haelga... there you are. Your special order from Hammerfell came in off the last Khajiit caravan."
48221,Try it out? What would you need a leather harness for anyway?
48222,"If he paid what he owes, I wouldn't have to say anything. Besides, what in Oblivion do you care?"
48223,I don't know. What'd he look like?
48225,There's another report of a disturbance in that Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
48226,I'm feeling much better now thanks to you.
48228,"Grelka, can you repair boots?"
48229,"Horker skin, actually."
48232,Find anything worthwhile yet?
48236,"Girduin died first. It happened so fast, none of us had a chance to react."
48237,"Oh, what is this? A visitor? To our farm? Oh, do stay for a while, dear."
48238,Vekel doesn't like strangers snooping around the Flagon.
48241,I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild seems to be back to its old tricks again.
48242,Did something happen at the Pawned Prawn?
48244,"Oh, Dorthe. You're breaking your mother's heart, you know that?"
48245,I'll let you explain that one to the Nords. 
48246,"One of them came in and demanded payment. Bolli tried to tell them no; stood up to them, but..."
48247,Just when you think things couldn't get any worse.
48249,Turning him in to the guards? Have you joined Mjoll as official peacekeepers of Riften? You cost me a lot of coin.
48250,"Maven, I... please, don't hurt me."
48251,"No, just very difficult. You have to look for shift in various shades of white. "
48252,The Argonian sugar-cane wine? It's pretty hard to get around here. Very expensive.
48253,That's really a shame - I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said you'd have all the most interesting guests.
48254,"Mama, can we talk. You know, about papa?"
48255,I'll see what I can do.
48256,I'm a growing boy. I need as much food as I can get.
48258,"Do you... do you think that could happen here? I mean, could a dragon come here and burn the city down?"
48259,I don't know. All we can do is hope the Eight will favor us and have these creatures stay far away from Riften.
48260,"Hi, Marise. How are you today?"
48262,"Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand did. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything."
48264,"Indeed, it has been jokingly suggested that we send the exact same response to both, which each will warp into support for their side."
48269,Thank you for this. Something for your trouble.
48270,"Naw... he's fine. Look, I wanted to ask if you'll... um, if you'd like to... well, like to have a drink with me at the Bee and Barb sometime?"
48271,"I have two more bushels for you, Marise. That should keep you well-stocked."
48272,Sounds good. May I owe you for them?
48273,I can't believe we're finally getting out.
48274,"Say, how are you going to sell all those fish before they spoil?"
48275,What is it now?
48278,I worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord warrior.
48279,Feel free to ask me anything you like.
48280,"Fine, fine. Get your hands off me. I'll be a good boy now."
48282,"I speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than that someone would actually want her in their bed."
48283,I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress!
48285,Lay down your weapons!
48287,You have strong arms. You'd make a good Orc.
48289,"The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Rift, allowing Imperial troops unhindered access."
48290,"They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far."
48292,Only criminals get sent to Cidhna Mine. They're not going to send us there.
48293,Not if you were the last man in the Empire.
48294,I'm ready. Let's go!
48295,"Hey, you mix potions, right? Can you brew me an ale?"
48297,"Oh, excuse me, milady. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people."
48299,"Wait, I hear something..."
48302,"I don't know. The guards are out looking for her, now. They'll be back soon."
48304,"To get the answers you seek, you must travel to the top of the mountain and speak to our master, Paarthurnax."
48306,"No... no, we did the right thing. The temple will take good care of her, and one day she'll be helping all of Skyrim."
48307,"You're right. She'll be a great Sybil, won't she?"
48309,You want me to hunt with you? I thought you preferred being alone.
48310,Hand what over? I have no idea what you're talking about.
48312,He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead.
48313,I don't know. Whenever those Silver-Blood men decide to leave.
48317,"Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first men in Tamriel, here..."
48318,"The Thalmor hunted us down, remember? It wasn't exactly great for recruitment."
48319,"Come now, you've got your orders. What else could you possibly need?"
48321,Damn Nords. Always getting in the way of us honest folk.
48322,"What did you say? You lazy coward, I'll cut your throat."
48324,A dwarven city. A place of mystery and death.
48325,"I... I'm sorry, Belchimac. I didn't mean that."
48327,"Well, girl, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint."
48328,I don't like bunking with Orcs. It's not... clean.
48329,"If you want me to leave, you could challenge me to a fight. I promise to stop once you've lost an arm."
48334,I do hope you know what you're doing with those flames...
48335,"My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family. "
48336,"You wouldn't understand, Lash. Your people aren't smart enough for politics."
48339,"No, certainly not. A small experiment may have gone awry, but clearly with no discernable consequences."
48342,"Did... did I say you weren't smart? I meant to say that I'm not smart, Lash. I'm just not smart enough to answer your questions."
48343, 
48345,"Tell you what... if you still feel unsure, come by the temple sometime and we'll talk about it."
48347,I hope that doesn't mean things are going to get worse around here.
48349,Mjoll! I'm glad I found you.
48351,"It's Bersi. He's getting so angry about the corruption in Riften, he said he's going to walk right up to Maven and give her a piece of his mind."
48353,Do not mistake our life for one of stupidity. It would be the last mistake you make.
48355,Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since. 
48356,"If I see him, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything brash. Don't worry."
48358,"Have you prepared the stables like I suggested, Shadr?"
48359,"Good. You could be our first line of defense since you live outside the city walls, so we're depending on you."
48361,"Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it."
48362,Bountiful. Although I would like to have anchored a bit closer to Goldenglow Estate.
48363,Why didn't you then?
48366,"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
48367,"I would never knowingly place Laila in danger, you know that too. Why do you always question my judgment? You don't trust me."
48368,"Hey, it's our hero! Seen any more of those pirates around here?"
48369,Will we be dining together this evening after my work at the fishery?
48370,"What? No! No, you don't understand! There's been some kind of mistake! I... Aggghhh!"
48371,"No, Igmund. It's too dangerous."
48373,"Well, not yet. The Empire hasn't been in charge for that long, and real change takes time."
48374,"Forsworn attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up to ""help."" They won't let anyone work until I sell it off."
48375,"Yes, headmaster."
48380,No. This is my land. You expect me to just hand it over to those Silver-Blood thugs?
48382,"No. In fact, the Tong were quite the bitter rivals with the Dark Brotherhood."
48384,So this is how you defeated Alduin. Ruth... zu'u ni Alduin.
48385,"My time saw the assassination of an Emperor as well. Alas, the Dark Brotherhood did not have the honor of that kill."
48387,"You're nothing, hear me? Nothing!"
48389,Thank you. You've done a good thing for me and my workers. Here. This is for you.
48390,J'zargo regrets that there was no chance to speak with the Psijic Monk.
48393,"That won't be the last we hear from the Silver-Bloods, but at least we can get back to work."
48394,"Fine, but I've locked the door so don't think you're getting in there without me."
48395,Sigh.
48396,"Haelga, I like you, so I'm only going to say this one time."
48397,"He wasn't protesting, Maven."
48398,Of course he wasn't you stupid whore; he's a man. Now I'm not going to warn you again. Is that clear?
48400,Very well.
48401,Hurry it up. I've got to get back before I'm missed.
48402,"We did well today, Shield-Sister."
48406,"Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend..."
48407,Wait... you mean I should just... tell her? Tell her how I feel?
48409,"I long to fight that foul worm, but by Shor's command we curb our wrath."
48410,"Do you mistrust poor Cicero? I am, as you say, just an innocent jester. A fool! Oh, but my work is not foolish, no. For I am our mother's Keeper."
48413,I have no problem killing you. How do you feel about dying?
48416,I'm sure you've noticed that Winterhold isn't exactly overflowing with people.
48418,Very funny.
48420,"I'm sorry for doubting you, friend. You have my thanks."
48421,"This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded."
48422,"Yeah, it was stupid of me."
48426,This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?
48427,Are you ready to face the Guild?
48430,"I'm sorry I mislead you. Return when this is over, and we'll talk about my involvement in the Thieves Guild."
48435,"There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor."
48441,Betrid. No! We had a deal you Forsworn bastards!
48443,But now Skyrim is at Ulfric's mercy.
48445,"Talos, who in life was known as Tiber Septim, united Tamriel and founded the Empire. "
48450,"There is no retribution in the hunt. It is not vengeance I seek, but the blood course of a living hunt."
48452,"Break the law here in Markarth, and maybe we can work something out. Courtesy of the Thieves Guild. "
48456,"Bolfrida is certainly grating, but she pays well. Thankfully nobody from the city can see me out here."
48461,It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal.
48462,"Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead."
48465,Arugh!
48466,Did you hear? People have been seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Divines have mercy.
48468,"Whatever you do, stay away from that Black Door. Being near it chills you to the bones."
48470,Are you going to help me with my mission? I need someone very capable.
48474,What?! This is exactly why... don't they understand it's hard enough to fight a war without these juvenile attempts to undermine authority?
48477,"Are you looking for a gift for a friend, perhaps? Or... a lover?"
48479,"Hjaalmarch isn't much, but it's a good start. I'll make a name for myself here, then maybe work my way up to someplace like Riften."
48482,"Um... yes, of course, sir. "
48483,By all the gods...
48485,"As you can see, it has not yet arrived."
48486,Malacath has given me a vision of a glorious death. I am to wait here until it finds me.
48488,Hmph.
48490,You should leave. I don't want you scaring off my good death.
48493,That can't be a coincidence.
48494,Take this and hold onto it. I'll be back for it later. I'll pay you good. Don't lose it.
48495,The gods will be the judge of that.
48496,"If you think there's anything you can do, be my guest."
48499,Perhaps the hofkahsejun - the palace in Whiterun... Dragonsreach. It was originally built to house a captive dovah.
48501,The Dark Brotherhood?
48505,Right. Lucky if it doesn't rip our throats out.
48507,Welcome to Riften.
48508,And why should I speak with you? You broke my heart.
48510,"It is called ""Force"" in your tongue. But as you push the world, so does the world push back."
48513,We'd better get out of here. I don't think this place is going to stand up to much more of this.
48515,I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end.
48516,Find yourself a weapon. You're going to need it.
48518,Let's see where this goes. We can't be the only survivors.
48519,I guess that'll teach me to try to reason with a Stormcloak.
48520,"But first, tell me. Why's a lizard want to fight for Skyrim?"
48522,Illusion really is the least appreciated of the schools of magic.
48523,"We only want what is best for Tamriel. Surely, the rebels will accept peace when they realize this."
48525,"At least, I don't think so. No, it's just... It's just something I'd prefer to keep to myself."
48528,It don't matter now. None of it does. Just leave me be.
48530,You better straighten things with the Guild or you won't be welcome here anymore.
48531,Get yourself a weapon. I'm going to need your help if we run into any more Imperials.
48532,We'd better get moving before any more Imperials show up.
48533,Look around. Grab anything useful.
48534,Come on!
48535,A cave. Up for some hunting?
48536,I hate bandits and thieves. Men like these raid our town every year.
48537,Let's see if we can find a way out of here.
48540,I can see that disapproving look in your eye.
48542,"I've got your back, don't worry."
48544,I think we're almost out. Come on!
48549,Do you have any idea how busy I am? My mixture could be burning as we speak!
48552,Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.
48556,Will there ever come a time when the people of Skyrim no longer need our services? I think not.
48557,"I've picked up some new clients and did a few jobs on my own, but I'm not sure if that will cover our expenses."
48558,"Today I've cleaned the linens, washed the floors, and checked in on all our guests."
48559,But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.
48561,How may I serve the Listener?
48562,"Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one."
48563,"Nervous being alone at night. Especially these days, with the Butcher prowling the streets."
48565,Worry about yourself.
48567,"Die, N'wah!"
48570,"The Empire's always taken us for granted. Nords died by the thousands in the Great War, and what did the Empire do?"
48571,Better down here than out there.
48572,I can't tell you. She might hear me. She's so close.
48574,Nothing for it but to keep moving.
48576,This is the end for you!
48577,"Hey, weren't you on the carts with the Stormcloaks?"
48579,Keep under cover until it's down!
48580,There's a lot of pressure for me to excel in my studies. I hope I can live up to expectations.
48581,"Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we celebrate."
48582,One of our marks seems to have an item of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?
48583,"Skyforge Steel is all the Companions will use, for good reason."
48584,I've fought worse than you!
48586,"These marks keep their ledger all neat and tidy, but they're ripe for some change if you know what I mean. Take it?"
48587,"The Forsworn have been spotted to the north, near Bruca's Leap Redoubt."
48588,"Okay, got just the one for you. Ledger's just beggin' to be changed and the Guild could use the coin. How about it?"
48589,"Yeah, sure. Got a business on tap that could use a little number rearrangin'. What do you say?"
48591,We want to waylay a shipment on the way from this business without them even noticin' anything went missin'. Want the job?
48592,"This business is a regular target for the Guild. They keep pretty shoddy records, so the job should be a cinch. You in?"
48593,I can send you into Azura's Star as soon as you're ready.
48595,"What do you want, beef roast?"
48597,Feel like doing a bit of writin'?
48599,On one condition.
48600,What? Where did you hear such a thing?
48604,I don't know how Ghorbash has so much spirit. He should act his age.
48605,The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.
48606,Let's get the axe and be done with this.
48609,"I feel like any moment, a draugr is going to come and chop my head off."
48610,May you all be as happy in your lives as I know I will be in mine. Thank you again for everything.
48611,"""We're safe"" he says. You'll eat those words when a draugr is tearing into your face."
48612,The guards say no draugr have come out of the mine.
48613,"Ah, you mentioned something that would convince us the festival should take place but I didn't expect King Olaf's lost verse. Please proceed."
48614,"Enjoy your stay, and don't break nothin'!"
48616,Yeah. Someone ticked off Maven and she wants to teach them a lesson... our way. You in?
48618,Death awaits you!
48619,Surely you're aware of the Great War between the Imperials and the Elves who called themselves the Aldmeri Dominion?
48621,Sorry about the mess. Keeping this place clean is quite a chore.
48623,The mark must have ticked-off our client badly. He's impatient and keeps asking if the job's done. Can you get him off my back?
48624,I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me.
48626,"Either you're lying to me, or..."
48627,Someone wants to see this mark suffer. They're paying a good bit of coin to have us plant the evidence in their house. You in?
48629,Sound like you can handle it?
48630,"When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way."
48632,"So, he thinks he can turn Camilla against me? Two can play at this."
48633,"Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me."
48634,Any luck locating those jazbay grapes?
48635,A new day is dawning. And you shall be its herald.
48636, 
48637,You did? We were waiting for the Jarl to send an entire regiment to clear that mine.
48639,I don't have to take this from the likes of you.
48641,"We've been trying to get this item for a while, but no one with the skills has come along to claim it. Can I count on you to get it?"
48643,Daar sul thur se Alduin vokrii. Today Alduin's lordship will be restored.
48644,Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!
48646,"Why are you bothering me, kinsman?"
48647,"Used to be a good-sized town, but folks have been moving to Riften for a while now."
48649,"Ah, is there any weapon finer than an Orc blade?"
48650,These Thalmor know how to treat a guest.
48651,"Sorry, mother. I'll focus on my work."
48652,Imagine the heads of your enemies as you forge. Let your hatred work the steel.
48654,"Fair or not, they'll pay it, and that's all I need to care about. Bear that in mind, sister."
48656,Let's see it.
48657,"This is a place for warriors, new blood. What brings you here?"
48658,"Get me mad, and I'll prank ya. And not a little. A lot."
48659,I served in the Legion. Perhaps I'll show you some of their technique one of these days.
48660,You're the one? From the... the Dark Brotherhood? The man I need killed is a Seasoned Hunter. He's just outside Falkreath. Here's the gold...
48661,Good luck finding the fragments.
48663,"If you find a book called ""The Last Scabbard of Akrash,"" could you bring it to me? Tacitus sure isn't learning by example."
48664,"The Captain has it locked away in that drowned ship by his quarters. He says it's ""to keep it safe"" but I know he's just keeping it for himself."
48665,"Tacitus? Boy's an Imperial. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it."
48666,Thanks.
48669,"Only that they break an old woman's heart. So many friends, so many kin, all lost trying to rebuild a past that was over long ago."
48676,"Why are you still standing around here? Go get me the Phial, you fool."
48677,"We must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time to lose."
48678,"All right, prisoner. Eyes front. You're in Cidhna Mine, now. And we expect you to earn your keep."
48679,"Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations."
48681,Then my answer is the Hall of the Dead is closed. By order of the Jarl. Understand?
48682,"You want me to let a dragon into the heart of my city, with the threat of war on my doorstep?"
48684,Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
48685,"No, we Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared."
48687,"You do realize these simpletons wouldn't know real music if it bit them in the britches, hmm? Very well. Your wish is my command."
48688,It's good to toughen her up. Not an easy world out here. Keep at it.
48694,Arkay keep you and protect you.
48695,You there. You another Imperial puppet? Answer me.
48696,"What of it, he says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos."
48698,I presume you're talking to me?
48699,You can tell Jarl Igmund that the Silver-Blood family won't tolerate his cowardice for much longer.
48704,"As far as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know."
48705,"My father's been haunting me ever since he died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad he's here."
48707,"On second thought, maybe I'm better off in here. At least I'll die with a clear conscience."
48711,"Well, all of the previous Apprentices have been accounted for, thanks to you."
48713,He's been gushing about how talented Ingun is at alchemy. He'd never say it to her face; that's not his way.
48714,The pleasure's all mine.
48715,I hope you're not planning to attack me again...
48716,"He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease your kind, Elf. Do your people rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?"
48717,Stop that! How can I do my job if I'm invisible?
48718,But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.
48719,Then back home is where you'll find me.
48723,"Now you people dictate everything we do. Don't want us acknowledging a ""mere human"" like Talos as the god he is."
48724,"If you could spare a septim, I'd be grateful."
48726,You ready to pay the toll? One shiv.
48727,"A man's heart is his own burden to bear, so I will honor your request, though it casts a bit of gloom on an otherwise glorious day."
48728,"Assur always wants to play ""Hunt the Elf"" and he makes me be the Elf."
48729,I'm selling the best mead in town for cheap. Interested?
48731,Blessed are the forgotten. The wretched.
48736,"Please address all questions to the Steward, Falk Firebeard."
48737,I'll bury my blade in your heart!
48741,Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it was worth it.
48742,What do you need to take?
48744,"Eirid says the mages at the College are nice people, but you said they're bad."
48747,"The way they walk, what they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway."
48748,I'll shoulder some of your burden.
48749,I am sworn to carry your burdens.
48750,"Sure, what have you got?"
48751,Not a damn thing. I was just as surprised as you to find that big black dragon here.
48752,If that is what you wish.
48755,Ready for some work or you just going to wander around all day?
48756,Did anyone else hear that?
48757,"Sure, feel free to hand me all the gold you want."
48758,"If you're working on any experiments, please clean up after yourself."
48759,"I'll tell you the same thing I told Skald. I'm here to help the people of Dawnstar, not play politics. Point your suspicions of treachery elsewhere."
48760,Do I get to keep it? Just kidding.
48761,"Ain't no doubt about it. The Thieves Guild is back, and they've got Riften in their grip."
48762,J'zargo only has so much room to carry things.
48763,It's where people in the city are buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.
48765,Is there someone out there?
48767,"I have a purpose for which you might prove useful. But first I must test the deftness of your guile, and the strength of your purpose."
48768,"Got a loving wife, a healthy son and a patch of land to call my own. What more could a man ask for?"
48773,"Oh, very well. I'll send my brother. He'll straighten this out."
48774,Just ask whenever you're ready to take on a dragon. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny.
48778,It's thousands of years old. Who knows what we might find?
48781,"Welcome to Kynesgrove. If you want to do business here, you'll have to deal with me."
48782,Not here. Downstairs.
48787,All hail the Dragonborn! Hail her with great praise!
48788,"Every moment counts, so I want you to take my horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool. Let's just say he's... one of us. "
48789,"Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas."
48790,The... Gourmet?
48791,So what can I get you?
48792,"His name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You can trust him."
48794,The Daedra has us. It's you or me!
48796,"It's easy to find things to sell. Things nobody will miss. Things from underground, or just left lying around in someone's house."
48797,"Fight well, or die well. Talos be with you!"
48803,Fine. It'll be five septims to repair it.
48805,Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
48806,My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?
48807,"Mortal. I give you my mace, in all its rusted spitefulness."
48808,Thorald's disappearance has left our family in shambles.
48809,I don't care what it costs. I need four longbows and four score of arrows. Just make it happen.
48810,Fine. What?
48812,The package was heavy... I needed his help getting it on his horse. What was inside?
48815,But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
48816,"Hey, I told you not to ask any questions. Now, here. For your trouble."
48817,Hmm. There's no simple answer to that. You want the long version or the short version?
48818,"Haldyn? I've heard of the man, but never guess he'd join up with some pirates."
48820,Well. I do suppose thanks are in order. So... my thanks.
48821,I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!
48822,"J'zargo has worked hard on learning new spells, trying new things. This will make J'zargo stand out as a mage."
48825,"Ha! Too true, my friend. Too true..."
48828,"Alva's been good to me ever since... well, since the fire."
48829,"Dinya, about that incense you requested? Its not arriving anytime soon. The Khajiit caravans are having tough times getting through."
48832,Here. Take this for your trouble. 
48834,Good speaking with you.
48835,"No. I'm surprised actually. I thought they had a stranglehold on the city, but in the last few years, it hasn't been that bad."
48836,Is it true you chased a thief from your home? I overheard Aerin mentioning it.
48838,Farewell.
48839,I like to share my good fortune with those who deserve it.
48841,What's with all the boots and shoes you keep buying? You must have bought twenty pairs in the last two years.
48842,"Always be prepared. You never know if you might get a split in one, or lose one, then where would you be? No sir, that's not happening to me."
48843,"Thanks for that bushel of apples, Marise. They're wonderful. How did you keep them so fresh?"
48844,It's true.
48845,"Oh, very good. Very good indeed. You, my dear, are going to fit in here quite nicely..."
48848,Hey. What's the matter with you? You have no right to spread rumors around town about me.
48849,Are you the one sent by Mara?
48851,"Well, if the shoe fits..."
48852,Spoken like a true daughter of Skyrim!
48856,Interesting. Keep your ears open for me and tell me if you hear anything more. I'll make it worth your while.
48858,Maven. How's the criminal underworld treating you this fine day?
48859,"You're a cold, unfeeling bitch."
48860,"My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt."
48861,At this loss...
48862,There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.
48863,We weep.
48868,"It could have been lightning, but there was no thunder. In the dream, the sense of foreboding grew, but I could never wake up."
48870,I can't believe it! You're... Dragonborn...
48871,Wait! Don't tell me! I want to guess!
48872,Thurri du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
48874,Always sad when someone has to die.
48875,Follow me. We're assembling near the main gate.
48876,"Tell me, brother. Are the stories true?"
48878,Let's go. We need to get to the Western Watchtower before it's too late.
48879,We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.
48881,So it's true. The Greybeards really were summoning you.
48882,"I even went to the College of Winterhold. But they just laughed at me. The magic is in the staff, not in me they said."
48883,Come on Galmar. We have a lot of work to do.
48885,Where oh where did you get this? Don't answer - I don't want to know.
48886,"The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout."
48891,That's some good armor you've put together.
48893,Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun?
48895,That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets back. Now then...
48896,"Here, take these. Looks like you're running low."
48898,There is an unnatural chill in the air. Some evil power is at work in this place.
48899,"General Tullius expects much of me, and thus I expect much of my men."
48901,We shout.
48903,And for ourselves...
48904,No. I mean it.
48905,I'm not sure that's a good joke to tell with women present...
48908,"In order to have the title bestowed upon you, you need to purchase a house within Riften."
48909,"The only reason you have the gold for your ""business"" is because I gave it to you."
48910,"I'll pay you back, if it means that much."
48913,"It's not about the coin, it's about honoring your legacy by picking up arms and keeping this land free."
48914,I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons. 
48915,"Oh, Bolli you silly man. You weren't saying that when you were licking that honey off my..."
48916,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
48917,Enough! That's enough. I surrender... I surrender.
48919,"I told you, I can't just pick up and leave. I have my wife, my business... not to mention you have the Bunkhouse."
48920,When have I ever been false with you?
48921,Why the impropriety!
48924,"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness."
48925,What is it?
48926,"Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see, just forgotten."
48927,Hey! Where did I go?
48928,This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.
48929,Just... stand still!
48932,"And when the guard traces it back here, and Maven is implicated, I'll be sure to tell her it was your idea."
48933,It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would have us deny our gods and our heritage. 
48935,So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?
48936,Shor's Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.
48938,"You still have the witches' heads? Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their magic, for me at least."
48939,"Ah, you saw that, did you?"
48940,Did he now? I can only hope.
48941,"You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak reinforcements taking us by surprise."
48942,"Takes a lot of strength to swing a pick axe, know what I mean?"
48943,"J'zargo has heard of the Staff of Magnus. Once you are done with it, perhaps you will allow J'zargo to... Borrow it?"
48945,"Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there."
48946,"One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with."
48947,I set up those targets a long time ago. I shoot at them from time to time. Don't want to get rusty with my bow.
48948,"It's the rush of good fortune, my friend. It makes you work harder."
48951,"Do you think you might, err, have a moment to look at something for me?"
48952,"Tradition is very important to me, son."
48955,I've told you everything I can. I don't know what else you could want...
48956,Take advantage of the fine food and drink. Such things have been scarce since the war began. 
48958,"My dear, I am merely observing the proceedings."
48960,"How are you, Drevis?"
48961,"Not on the way back. Once she gets there, it's not up to me to decide what's done with her."
48962,Spare a coin for a poor old woman?
48963,"Err, excuse me Enthir. Might I have a moment?"
48965,"Well, then. Fine. Have a nice day."
48966,"What are you up to, Gane? Hmm?"
48968,Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
48971,"That's enough of this unnecessary chatting, we need to keep going."
48972,"If you see Karliah, don't hesitate. Kill her."
48973,Instead you've chosen to fall over your own foolish code.
48974,Lookin' to shatter records or bones? My beasts can do both.
48975,"We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand."
48977,"I have been holding him here. While he regains strength, however, I am fading. "
48982,"Do your worst, monster!"
48984,Just take my advice and just get out of Riften as soon as you can.
48986,"You would do this? Three vessels in the tomb below hold the power to vanquish Hevnoraak. Before anything else, we need those."
48988,(Heavy breathing)
48989,(Heavy breathing)
48990,Uncle Calcelmo....
48991,You don't want to be part of history? Fine. I'll be at the shrine if you change your mind.
48993,That's him! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill him!
48995,Good luck. I hope you get there in time.
48996,We'd better keep moving.
48998,"Shor's bones, did it kill them all...?"
49000,We'd better keep moving. Who knows what that dragon is doing.
49003,"You'll need to get your hands on some Balmora Blue from Sabine Nyette down by the docks. She's the first mate on another ship, the Red Wave."
49004,I'm looking forward to testing myself against this dragon.
49006,My kinswoman died. Things won't be the same without her.
49007,Why else have they cursed me? Killed all my wives?
49009,Pick up your mess. Then we'll talk.
49010,General.
49012,The mine is just how I remember it.
49014,Get under cover! The dragon - it's still around somewhere!
49015,"Damn it, I lost her! Protect the Jarl!"
49016,Dragonborn... it's an honor.
49018,Sometimes I just like to watch them burn.
49019,"They may be cowards, but I'm not. I'll go with you."
49020,Vals Veran will die for what he's done.
49021,I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.
49022,"I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us."
49023,"Scatter and get behind cover! We need to hurt it, somehow! If you've got a bow or spells, now would be a good time to use them!"
49025,"Begone, World-Eater! By words with older bones than your own we break your perch on this age and send you out!"
49026,"What? An intruder? Attack, my lovelies!"
49027,"You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here."
49032,"I don't know how you got it back, and I don't want to know. Frankly, I don't even care... I'm just so glad to see it again."
49033,So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?
49034,I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than that.
49036,Giants have been spotted up near Red Road Pass. Best to keep away and avoid it entirely.
49039,What if he's right? Maybe I'll buy one.
49040,"Ah, smell that fresh air? Truly, this is a good place to play a song."
49041,"If you're heading east, steer clear of Hillgrund's Tomb. Thing about those old crypts - the dead having trouble staying that way."
49042,You sure that's power we're meant to have?
49044,Very well. Meet me at the summoning circle in the marsh at dawn. We shall banish the creature you have become.
49045,"Whenever a man's life is saved by armor made with these hands, these hands have changed that man's destiny and his family's."
49047,Stand in the center of the circle.
49049,As you desire.
49051,We're mounting our final attack on Windhelm. You're needed on the front line. Get a move on soldier!
49053,The ritual is complete.
49056,Nothing! I... it's ill fortune. That's all.
49057,You are human again. Like the rest of us.
49060,"Divines sake, Skald. Who do think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers, anymore."
49064,"If you're smart, you'll walk away. "
49067,"No, and I'm not expecting any."
49068,Really? That must be so nice. I came all the way to Skyrim just to get away from my family's expectations.
49070,My family didn't really approve of me coming here at all.
49071,"Ouch! Pointy pointy! My home is well defended. I always have been a stickler for details. Get it? ""Stick-ler."" Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I slay me!"
49073,Not at all. It means I'm not being hounded about my progress at the College.
49074,Maybe later. I'm sort of busy now.
49076,Well? You going to scout ahead or travel with me?
49078,"We provide clothing for all of Solitude's most... influential residents. But for you, I'll make an exception."
49079,"Have you spoken to my parents yet? Please, my love depends on it!"
49081,Jarl Balgruuf is waiting.
49083,"So, what's the plan?"
49085,"If you're in the market for the finest bows money can buy, you're talking to the right person."
49086,How dare you! After all we've been through together? How can you do this to me!
49087,Good enough. We'll meet up near the watchtower. Don't take any chances until we get there.
49088,"Mama, when can we go play in the river again?"
49090,No. Not really.
49093,"Of course nothing in here is stolen. Only a careless, shameful, idiotic fetcher would do something as stupid as to buy pilfered goods...."
49095,"Just get the notes and bring them to me. If you can't do it, I'll find some other way to manage it."
49097,"I'm the heavy hitter around here. When someone needs pushing around, I'm the one they send in."
49101,She what?
49103,"Sure, pick on the old guy!"
49106,"Al right, this should be enough to figure out what she's up to. Then I can make sure it doesn't work."
49107,"Good, good. She didn't see you take them?"
49109,Quiet! I think I heard something.
49110,He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he was trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. Did he really do it?
49113,"If this was my Empire, I'd be able to worship whoever I damned well pleased. You wish to see an Empire without Talos? Without its soul?"
49114,Mercer? This is the one I was talking about... our new recruit.
49115,Get this gate open.
49117,Put down your flagons filled with your vile liquids and embrace the teachings of the handmaiden of Kyne.
49118,"But he has returned home, and people have heard strange chanting. They say it's the Black Sacrament, the ritual to contact the Dark Brotherhood."
49120,"Enough, Maramal. We've all heard of the dragons and their return. There's no need to use them as an excuse to harass our customers."
49121,"Oh, it's Nazeem. He's been spending more and more time fawning over the Jarl. I swear, we're hardly ever home at the same time anymore."
49122,"That's kind of you, Lod."
49123,"Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation."
49124,"Yes, just a brief overview of our facilities. Are you ready?"
49125,"We're not kicking you out, just keep the sermons at the temple and let us all sin in peace."
49127,Well done. They never knew what hit them.
49128,"Oh, yes. All the time. They come with the visions, as always."
49129,"We had the advantage of surprise this time, but don't expect it to last. Let's move out."
49130,"I wouldn't say that. But he and Ulfric have been at odds for years, and I'm afraid Balgruuf will end up siding with the Empire because of it."
49133,Precisely!
49136,A man opens a gate and they cut his head off? Doesn't seem right to me.
49138,"I am, Jarl. I wish to present King Olaf's verse from the Poetic Edda. Recovered this very day from the Bards Tomb."
49141,Those draugr are going to be back. I can feel it.
49142,I believe this gem is worth more than you are at the moment.
49148,I would not sell it to just anyone but I'll make an exception for you. The cost to replace the gem is quite high. 
49150,I would hate to see our reputation further tarnished.
49151,Very good. I hope this will allow us to maintain our reputation.
49152,"I'm sorry, but you've been suspended from the College. I can't be seen talking to you right now."
49153,"When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire."
49154,This should be fun.
49157,I met several of your kind during my studies of life-extending magics. I even  considered becoming a vampire myself.
49158,"They are rare things, I have one I picked up during my research of the Oblivion realms but it is a precious item. "
49159,"They say Falion of Morthal has studied vampires, draugr and all matter of undead."
49160,"Now if ya don't mind, my house could do with a bit of dusting."
49161,"Hello there, can I pour you a Black-Briar Mead?"
49164,My business is my own. Why can't others see that?
49165,You heard right! I said a dragon!
49166,"But the Empire will accept them, until the dragon menace is dealt with."
49167,I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!
49168,Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?
49169,"But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families."
49170,But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?
49172,Yeah!
49173,Yeah!
49174,"The way is dangerous, and the gate will not open. You shall not gain entry!"
49175,"He's a bard, so he says. Occasionally he finds time to do his job here at the mill."
49178,"Of a sort. I don't have formal training in the Restoration school, but... something just as good."
49179,"The door up ahead will be locked. Klotha, one of the hagravens, will have the key on her."
49181,You want something from me?
49183,"Could you... could you give her this letter, and say it's from Sven? I think I've matched that Nord's lack of cleverness perfectly."
49184,I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your associate immediately.
49186,Good.
49187,Why that jealous idiot. Thought he could just manipulate me into never seeing Sven again?
49189,He what? What are you talking about?
49190,"Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants."
49191,What is this? The elf playing at treachery? Shocking.
49193,Indeed I do.
49194,"You may be right. Camilla may see Faendal as little more than a friend, but why take chances?"
49195,"Thank you. When I find my daughter, it will be thanks to you."
49196,"When I ask you for something, I expect it to get done."
49197, 
49198,Camilla Valerius knows I'm the best man in Riverwood. That elf is kidding himself if he thinks she would choose him over me.
49200,I'll kill you if I have to!
49202,"Here, let me give you a particularly venomous letter. Say it's from Faendal. That should get Camilla to stop inviting the elf over."
49203,Very well. I'll meet you there.
49204,Is that sarcasm? I've heard better wisecracks from Orgnar.
49205,That's not my problem.
49207,"Whoa, there. I don't know where you're going, but stay out of that mine. It isn't safe."
49208,What is that blowhard up to now?
49209,It's a miracle these Stormcloaks haven't robbed us blind yet. I'm sure it's only a matter of time.
49211,"Well, you can tell that... that long-eared ass not to come around the store anymore. He's not welcome."
49212,"What, what is this? Is this what he really thinks about me?"
49213,From Faendal? That's strange. He's never written to me before.
49214,"Hold on, my boy. Hold on!"
49216,You're still alive?
49218,"Did she appeal to your sense of honor? Your greed? A more... base need, perhaps? It doesn't matter."
49222,Oh my. He... he wanted me to think Faendal wrote this?
49223,What are you talking about? What's in the letter?
49224,Now that's what I like to hear. Good work. I think you deserve some gold from my tips at the inn.
49226,"I appreciate your help. Please, take this. Some gold I've saved up from working at the mill."
49227,I'm heading home if you need me.
49229,"But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha!"
49230,Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?
49232,"I'll be heading home, then, if you need me."
49233,"He's busy forgetting that Ulfric Stormcloak saved this city from the Forsworn. Ulfric's a hero, not a damn criminal."
49235,Nah!
49236,I'll head back home if you need me.
49237,"Mauhulakh brought us in when he found ebony in the mine. Not enough men in town to work it, so here we are."
49239,You wouldn't have a few minutes to run down to the docks would you?
49242,"I will be back at your house if you need me, Thane."
49243,"You're letting me go? What's wrong, is my skill with a blade making you look bad? Hah! I'm kidding, friend. Until we meet again!"
49244,"That's the Greybeards' business, not ours."
49246,Speak with Galmar. He'll size you up and see where we can best use your talents.
49247,Such a shame. I thought we were getting along so well. I'll head back to Riften if you should have second thoughts.
49248,"My life with the Alik'r is over now, but I have no wish to die in this gods-forsaken land. If I can be released from prison, I may start over."
49249,"You're not planning on hurting anyone with that weapon there, are you?"
49250,Annnddd... Point of no return reached.
49252,So... very tired...
49254,"Really? J'zargo was having such fun. Ah, well. Back to the College then."
49257,I mine. Work the smelter. Ain't much else to tell.
49260,"The gold, the jewels... it's all gone."
49261,You'll be all right on your own? Then I'll see you back at the College.
49262,If that's what you want. Come find me at the College if you change your mind.
49263,Last warning. Stand back from the execution.
49264,"What's more, Elisif has declared the Burning of King Olaf should become a weekly event."
49265,You want me to close my eyes? Would that even things up a little?
49266,Due to your adventurous nature several of the college professors have some things they wish you to do.
49267,"Yes. Congratulations, you are now a full-fledged member of the Bards College."
49268,Ah the bard-to-be. Did Viarmo send you?
49269,It is good to meet you in person.
49272,"I know many things. I have studied things beyond the reach of most humans, traveled the Oblivion planes, seen things one should not see."
49275,Good. The whole point of being in hiding is to appear to be someone you're not.
49276,Let him guide your path.
49277,The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door.
49279,I have vowed to serve Amaund Motierre until my dying breath. Best remember that.
49283,"I suppose you'd better show that to Tolfdir nonetheless. And please, ask before tampering with anything else."
49284,How will I know when I'm ready? 
49287,Never been to Whiterun before? The Jarl's palace is something to see. Dragonsreach they call it. Big old dragon skull hanging on the wall.
49290,"You'll be helping out an old beggar, and the Divines smile on that sort of thing."
49292,But aren't even you the least bit nervous? After everything that's happened?
49294,Perhaps my prayers were answered and your reason for stumbling across Dawnstar is more than a mere coincidence.
49295,This isn't a damn summer picnic! Hurry up. We need to hit them before they know we're here.
49297,"It is large, indeed. I did not anticipate Avanchnzel's size or the time needed to uncover the entrance."
49299,"I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it."
49300,It's bad luck to talk about that place.
49302,Just be careful where you do it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before them.
49303,"Well, you're makin' friends all over, ain't ya?"
49304,"You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur?"
49306,Alain is... is dead?
49307,Oh. Oh I see.
49313,This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council. Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't somethin' you'd give up lightly.
49314,"But to answer your question, the White-Gold Concordat was the fancy name they put on the peace treaty between the Empire and the Thalmor."
49316,I heard you hurt someone in town not too long ago.
49319,Let's see...
49320,"So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years."
49324,"Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only, for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement."
49325,"Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed. "
49326,"Yes, you see, the thing is... I'm not concerned with ""everyone's best interest."" I find I'm only concerned with my own."
49331,"Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise beyond your station. Delicious."
49332,The Elder Council...
49333,We will be back. This is not over.
49336,Thanks. I guess.
49337,"I visit the temple sometimes, but perhaps not often enough. Thanks for bringing this to me."
49339,"Nothing like the smell of a white-hot blade, eh?"
49340, 
49341,"The water is cold, but it's a lot better than having to work up in the dry air."
49343,Did you see someone run past just now?
49344,That was fun.
49345,"I long to be out there, with my brothers, waging war against the Empire."
49346,I need to make a few things clear before I accept these Legionnaires of his.
49349,I'll fight the entire Legion myself if they dare show their faces here.
49351,"Remember, the Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Just beneath the road, and away from prying eyes."
49352,One lives for the things he is willing to die for.
49353,"When I've made enough money, I'm going to return to Morrowind in high style."
49354,"If there's nothing else, I really do have important matters tend to."
49356,Maybe you could buy a gift for a friend? A best friend?
49359,The Empire would have us become slaves to the Thalmor. We are not slaves. We are men. Free men who will slay anyone who begs to differ.
49360,My brother was the best man in Solitude.
49363,How are you feeling?
49364,Quaestor.
49366,Some say Ulfric desires to be king and nothing more... have they not seen that his anger floats on a sea of tears?
49367,The Empire is weak. That is why we fight them. Skyrim must be ruled by the strong.
49369,"Don't do that, it's mean!"
49370,What will Skyrim have become if her children submitted to tyranny?
49373,Solitude wouldn't be the same without the Fire Festival. City owes you a debt of gratitude.
49375,"If you really think this is the only way, I trust you. Let's not waste any time."
49376,"What? You think me too old, too feeble? There is more knowledge in me than in two of you pups put together. And knowledge... knowledge is my weapon."
49377,"Um, I don't know, why?"
49378,"I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a Hagraven and lived. I'll understand if you decline."
49379,"You infiltrated the position, eliminated the target, and made it look like an accident. Impressive. I'd say you earned your bonus on that one!"
49381,"I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?"
49382,Sometimes I miss being out there in the middle of the action.
49383,"You picked a bad time to get lost, friend."
49385,Stormcloaks... even the name of their rebellion stinks of Ulfric's vanity. He wants to be king. That's all this is about. One man's ambition.
49386,"The sooner we end this rebellion, the sooner I'll be able to sleep at night."
49390,It's always good to see someone I can count on.
49391,Tribune.
49392,"This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery."
49394,You're the one saved the Fire Festival. I remember.
49396,Quaestor.
49397,They appear to have little interest in real study and research for the sake of gaining knowledge.
49398,"If you're still breathing in a few weeks, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends."
49400,"A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what then?"
49401,Back to the great task of waiting.
49404,My hatred for the Empire is bested only by love for my countrymen.
49406,Was that really necessary?
49408,"Oh, dearie, it was so long ago. But I do remember the celebration we had afterwards. Mead never tasted so good."
49409,Addvild's made me a happy woman. I wouldn't want to be with anyone else in the world.
49410,You must present your invitation to be admitted to the party.
49412,Never did find out why they came sprawling into town like that.
49413,I'm sure it will be fine. Just don't be late.
49414,"Blessings upon you, traveler."
49415,"Now, who was it that kidnapped the Jarl's son 20 years ago?"
49417,That was good work. Deeja's in the hold of the ship. Go down two levels.
49418,You should quit working in the Eastern Mine. Leigelf's no good to work for.
49419,Better to stick together down here.
49420,"Nosy one, huh? I was a mage back in Morrowind. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe."
49422,"Well done, indeed."
49427,"For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood."
49430,I wish the Legate would let us clear out of here. Place gives me the creeps.
49432,"No going back that way, now."
49433,A standard spell for one skilled in Destruction magic is the Firebolt. Casting one at the seal on the ground here would be sufficient.
49435,They don't call me the Ember-Master for nothing. What do you need?
49437,I guess we'd better try this way.
49438,"Leave me alone, Lod."
49439,"If it's a bed you need, talk to Keerava in the Bee and Barb. She'll set you right."
49440,Very well then.
49441, 
49444,A buxom barmaid between the sheets will keeps me plenty warm.
49445,"He never succeeded in getting much support, so a few months ago he murdered the High King! That got the Empire's attention."
49447,I can't believe it...
49448,"I like your shop, Lami."
49449,"Oh, why is that?"
49450,You haven't heard of the civil war in Skyrim? I guess down in Cyrodiil people have other things to worry about.
49453,"The Nords are tired of spending our blood fighting the Empire's wars, and paying for the Empire's decadence with our taxes."
49455,Then perhaps you care to explain why you are standing so close a dead body with your weapon drawn?
49456,"I got some fine armor, if you're lookin'."
49457,Are my men now giving free reign to anyone who wanders into the castle?
49459,"This time, the General turned the tables on him. Ulfric rode right into our ambush with only a few bodyguards."
49462,You just worry about fulfilling the contract. I'll take care of things on this end.
49463,"The Imperials were waiting for us. As pretty an ambush as I ever saw. We were outnumbered five to one, at least."
49467,"I'm dealing with a few new research proposals, evaluating the results of three long-term projects, and keeping an eye on our new Apprentices."
49469,But that old bellyacher just fed me some nonsense about light ruining his mixtures and being close to the water... agh.
49470,"When Elgrim said we were setting up shop down here, I told him he would catch his death."
49471,"I know how to mix a few basic potions, but I'm nowhere near as skilled as a master alchemist."
49472,"My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame Endarie."
49473,I just think Elgrim's taken it upon himself to mentor the young thing so he focuses a lot of attention on her.
49474,"...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the ""Gourmet""..."
49477,Here you go. Tell Hafjorg that she can chip off whatever she thinks is a fair trade for their time.
49479,It's about time; I sent them a letter weeks ago. That Elgrim... he'd forget his own pants if his wife didn't help him dress.
49480,Yes.
49482,"Then right before the spiders had moved in, we found that chunk of ore. Never seen anything like it."
49483,"But Ulfric and his ""Stormcloaks"" are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory against the Dominion, it's in the Empire."
49486,No doubt most folk in Skyrim consider the dragons terrifying. I find them... wondrous.
49488,Here you go. Try not to spill anything on them.
49489,"Here, I had him make you a few things for all that travel."
49490,Hey! Wanna play tag?
49491,"Let's both get on with our lives now, hmm?"
49493,"Perhaps. But he spoke of this ""curse"" to you, which means it has deeply affected him."
49496,And we hear a handful of Imperials are realizing they are Stormcloaks at heart. We need to send them a little encouragement.
49497,"I felt a caress on my cheek some time ago... I thought it to be a trick of the wind, but I think it was a message from my father."
49498,Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you.
49499,Fire is not a thing to be played with...
49500,"Susanna's the third. It's always the same: young girl, killed at night, body torn up."
49503,What you fail to realize is your actions were expected and represent nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.
49504,"Good, these will make wonderful settings for my rings."
49505,"Yes, Thane. What is it?"
49506,Potatoes? Again?
49507,The ivory from this tusk will be perfect for the inlay on my amulets.
49511,"Here, let me give you this. It's the least I can do for all your trouble."
49512,"No, I think I have enough here to get started."
49514,And this must be the Hall of Stories.
49515,You did it. There's the entrance!
49516,"I expected better of you, Dragonborn. You swore an oath to serve the Emperor. Don't forget it."
49517,"I suppose you're used to traveling, being a stranger around here."
49518,Have you tried to Shout?
49520,"If you think you might be able to do that kind of thing, the Legion could certainly use your help."
49522,"They keep the doors locked when they come down. You kill them, you're trapping us here with no food."
49524,Laelette? I thought she left to join the Stormcloaks. Ah! My poor Laelette!
49525,Vittoria! No!
49526,"Hello, Listener."
49530,Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.
49531,Maybe there's something on the claw itself that could help us.
49532,"Oh, good. I've been waiting for you. Here you go, it's all ready."
49533,"Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime."
49534,"When you're ready, meet me at Snow Veil Sanctum."
49535,"If you need weapons or armor, see Alvor, the blacksmith."
49536,Mercer was able to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher... the Skeleton Key.
49537,I swear I feel like I'm being watched.
49538,Huh. Lot of old guys around. I don't really know how I can help.
49540,"Come, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!"
49541,"Morthal used to be a quiet place. But then, the world used to make sense."
49544,She's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in her hold.
49546,"Next, I need a little investigating to confirm the possibility of blackmailing the Jarl's Steward."
49549,Keep your distance...
49550,Are we truly sure this is a good idea?
49551,"I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name ruined... and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit for duty?"
49552,Me? I'm Burguk's brother. I came back after serving many years in the Legion.
49553,"I don't believe it. You found the Forgemaster's Fingers. You've impressed me, outlander. No one else has returned from this task before."
49555,The one and only.
49556,"But I've had some disturbing reports of you... seen talking to General Tullius in Castle Dour, for example."
49557,"You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for Farengar, remember?"
49560,You... you were at Helgen. One of the prisoners. What makes you think I'm interested in someone like you for the Legion?
49561,Don't you remember? His name is Hroggar.
49562,This betrayal made them what they are now... horrible blind monstrosities with a burning hatred of any but their own kind.
49563,"Oh, so you're trying to play both sides, is that it? What do you really want?"
49565,Only a Dragonborn can stop him. But no Dragonborn has been known for centuries.
49568,"Alduin has returned, just like the prophecy said!"
49570,Not everyone's agreed to the Moot. 
49571, 
49573,"But remember - you're one of us now, forever. Whatever Imperial loyalties you may have had... that's all in the past, forgotten."
49575,I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
49577,The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen.
49582,"Well... I'd certainly love to have such a powerful staff, but I'm not really sure that any of us need it."
49583,"It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look."
49586,Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.
49587,I'm being as careful as I can.
49588,"I have dishonored my brothers by being captured, and so they have left me here."
49590,"Mulush, we need a break. The heat from the smelter is too much."
49591,I could smelt metal in half the time as you weak-willed pink-skins. Do I have to do everything?
49592,I don't want any of you thieving workers even thinking about stealing any silver.
49593,I know what I'm doing. Stop telling me.
49595,You got anything in here worth buying?
49597,Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.
49601,I don't like the look of this place.
49602,Stupid dog.
49603,"You made it! I'm impressed. It was a gamble, but turned out well."
49605,"I'm no man's fool. I know Ulfric Stormcloak's selfish and power-hungry, but he's the devil I know. Does that put it plain enough for you?"
49606,He he he he he.
49609,I don't know what we're doing here. Ulfric must have his reasons.
49610,They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay.
49612,"And in return, both in life and in death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher."
49613,"The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish."
49616,Perhaps we can find a way for both of us to prosper from this unfortunate discovery?
49618,I'll work hard to justify your faith in me.
49624,"Not my thing, but who am I to judge..."
49628,I hope the Caller turns you inside out!
49629,"Knowing this, are you ready to undergo the ceremony?"
49630,Over here!
49631,"Once the Oath has been struck, the terms are binding."
49634,Lucan's dead. I guess I'm in charge of the Riverwood Trader now.
49635,"All right, head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think."
49636,It's fine. Much better than the rickety tools I had in the Legion.
49637,"Yes, but they'll come around eventually. You'll see."
49639,I knew it! I knew my father was a hero and he didn't just run away.
49644,I was about to say how impressed I was that you always managed to put it back together.
49645,"Flattery doesn't suit you, Thongvor."
49646,It is said that the Phial will replenish whatever fluid is placed inside of it.
49647,"Wonderful, just wonderful! I knew I could count on you!"
49648,"I grow tired of counting coin all day. Put steel in my hand, not gold."
49651,"Use your skills, not your blade and you'll do fine."
49652,"Don't judge Dengeir too harshly. He is old, but he means well."
49656,No man is a match for a dragon.
49657,Get over to Windhelm. We're mounting our final attack!
49658,"You, too, huh? I'd much rather a straight up fight than creeping around a place like this."
49660,Come then. See what I can do now.
49661,May the shadows guide your journey.
49664,Now you're threatening me? What in the name of the Divines is wrong with you?
49668,"You're not kidding. Ulfric's the leader of the Stormcloaks - you know, the traitors trying to break Skyrim away from the Empire."
49670,At this rate that'll never happen.
49672,But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.
49673,"Tendrils of thought may wind their way through this realm, but those tendrils bind our reality together."
49675,"Stew again, papa? I want steak."
49676,Maybe. Let me think about it.
49677,This has to be the worst place in Skyrim to run a mill. How am I supposed to do anything with all those bears running around?
49679,Let's get up there before mother finds out what we're doing.
49680,"Look at you, begging on the streets. Learn a trade."
49683,"Hogni Red-Arm, more like Hogni Fat-Arm."
49684,"But most of their supply routes come south, from Cyrodiil."
49688,You little twig. I'll snap you in two!
49689,Silver-Bloods tax everything now that they run the city.
49690,Just try it. Maybe a little time inside Cidhna Mine will get rid of all that fat on you.
49691,I never imagined we'd find something like this.
49693,"You take care of yourself, now."
49698,I'm not too proud to admit that I need a bit of help from time to time.
49699,What? What did I do this time? I was just standing here!
49701,We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The people are still weighing things in their hearts. 
49702,"It's my hope that you will, yes."
49703,"Ready to listen to the Silver-Blood family now, Igmund?"
49704,I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise.
49707,We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until your conditions have been met.
49708,"Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild."
49709,"Just about eighty years ago, there was a terrible disaster. The cliffs overlooking the Sea of Ghosts collapsed, taking most of Winterhold with them."
49712,"Still suspicious of me. Well, don't say I never offered."
49716,"Maybe so, but I can't be making concessions before negotiations even start. It makes the Empire look weak."
49721,I am your better half. And your better half is telling you to stop being an idiot and serve the customers their drinks!
49726,"Those awful Thalmor can't touch us, thanks to Ulfric."
49729,"The people of Skyrim don't like magic much, so about the only place you're likely to find a teacher is the College of Winterhold."
49730,"Ah. But I have my own champion this time, Logrolf."
49731,It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.
49732,"Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen."
49734,Good work. Knowing more about the enemy's position makes it that much easier to take it from him.
49738,"Damn it, we're blundering around in the dark here! We need to figure out who's behind it all!"
49739,"Now, we'll take our friend here back to Hammerfell, where she will pay the price for her treason."
49740,We must Shout together these shadows to dispel.
49741,"How did you manage to damage it, then? This is what I get for not retrieving it myself."
49742,"You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover."
49743,This can't be true. I've known Mercer too long...
49744,"Well, here you go. Spend it wisely, and if I may... Don't allow yourself to be fooled by a pretty face. You're better than that."
49747,"Oh, probably a troll. "
49748,"It's no secret why you're here and you have proven your skill in combat. Let us talk a moment, and no one else needs to die."
49749,"Stay your hand, warrior!"
49750,Are you sure? I doubt you stand a chance against the Thalmor.
49752,"There's no gold, nothing shiny at all."
49753,"Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision."
49755,"We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal."
49756,At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.
49757,"Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside."
49760,Shhh! Be still. Beware her anger!
49761,"Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed."
49762,A new chapter in the Thieves Guild is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.
49763,You could say that. I own the place.
49764,Lead the way.
49765,"Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive."
49766,"Then turn around and go back where you came. City doesn't need you, doesn't want you."
49767,Ugh... dark sorcery. Always makes my skin crawl.
49769,This isn't over.
49770,Faas...
49771,The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.
49772,"Last warning. Leave, now."
49773,Let me know if you need anything. We're here to provide.
49775,"Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put Gallus's memory to rest."
49777,"They have a whole mine filled with prisoners to dig up silver ore, gets smelted by workers they pay, and they own half the city."
49779,"I'm sure when the time for promotions comes, they'll go to the most deserving mage."
49780,You've got a fine look about you. Come have a visit at the Braidwood Inn. Better than home!
49783,Balgruuf will know my meaning.
49784,Men who understand each other often have no need for words.
49786,I'll talk to Alvor about getting us a new one.
49789,All my gold... completely gone. Now I have to start over. I'll never use skooma again!
49790,Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.
49792,"I'm only a humble acolyte, though. If you wish to avail yourself of Mara's blessing, you should speak with Dinya Balu or Maramal."
49794,Tsk. What a woman will do for a few coins...
49795,"But this sneaking around. It doesn't befit warriors of your standing. Aela knows better, and so should you."
49796,"In any case, I have a task for you."
49798,Maybe I'll hold off and go another day. Get some rest first.
49799,"As in all matters of faith, though, the reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you."
49805,I could take him.
49806,"The boy has a nugget of truth, but the reality is more complicated than that."
49808,"If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power. "
49809,You're my... friend....
49810,"One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven. "
49813,It's remarkable that our farms are so prosperous given the harsh winters of late.
49814,Don't make me laugh!
49815,The trade routes are affected as well. Procuring supplies is a guessing game. Weapons sell well though.
49816,You're headed to Falkreath.
49817,But we had been deceived.
49820,"My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl."
49822,Do you mind? I'm busy doing the fishstick. It's a very delicate state of mind!
49823,Was it something I said?
49824,We'll get to that.
49825,"Hey, over here!"
49829,Hrrrmm.
49831,"All I know is that Idolaf made some effort to find out what happened to him, but was told to stop asking questions."
49832,"It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are."
49833,"For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity."
49834,"Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. "
49835,"The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit."
49838,"Of course I do. If I didn't, most of these books would've been burned to ashes or dissolved to nothing before the Third Era."
49840,That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out.
49841,"If you need another drink, I'll be right here."
49842,What can I get for you?
49845,"This is not about your desires, lass."
49847,"This is not about your desires, lad."
49848,"I hope it was important, because it means you weren't here to defend him."
49849,One of the fiercest battles I've ever seen.
49852,The old man... Kodlak... he's dead.
49854,Just you wait and see.
49855,But you and I are going to reclaim them.
49856,"No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad."
49858,Is it?
49859,The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now.
49862,We grieve.
49863,We grieve.
49867,For the fallen...
49868,"Not long, but you can't start casting with a fireball coming at you."
49869,Sometimes I hear Yngvar singing in his room. He's actually quite good.
49870,So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi.
49871,"Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad, still?"
49872,"The longer they're around, the more danger I'm in! Please, kill Kematu and end this nightmare for me!"
49873,Ulfric will allow Imperial troops to enter Winterhold. Korir will replace Kraldar as Jarl.
49875,And I have you to thank for it. I won't forget this.
49876,Do you think it's gone yet?
49877,"Don't worry, it will all be waiting for you when you get back."
49878,And so slain the beast inside of me.
49880,Who are you? What do you want?
49881,I tracked it to a group of bandits nearby. But I'm no fool. I'd need the Whiterun guards or maybe hire the Companions to get it.
49884,"If it's all the same to you, Scouts-Many-Marshes prefers to eat and drink in peace."
49885,"Aela's laid claim to your services, and I've learned the hard way not to upset her. Best you stick to her for now."
49886,These earthen passages do not agree with me. I already miss the wind and sky.
49887,"Then you have Hemming, Maven's son; spoiled brat and heir to her empire. He follows her word like a loyal dog follows its master."
49888,"We did well today, Shield-Brother."
49889,"They're mercenaries, only in it for the money. They're led by a man named Kematu. Get rid of him, and the rest will scatter."
49892,She just wouldn't hear it.
49894,Last mistake.
49897,"Our Chief, Yamarz, was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed."
49898,"No, don't go! You may not be one of our tribe, but you are an Orc nonetheless!"
49900,"Just say the word, master."
49901,What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?
49902,That's right. Old inn to the south. The oaf doesn't even bother to visit these days. What am I supposed to do if the dragons burn down the farm?
49903,The city is yours.
49905,"We meet at last, my dear lady."
49906,Take us to Movarth's Lair!
49907,What is this?
49908,I'll need to lock up the store. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us.
49910,But where will I go? I can't keep running forever!
49914,"Yes, but it needs to be kept quiet."
49915,That godless Emperor can shove his damn treaty into the steaming nether-reaches of my you-know-where.
49916,"But I am Al-du-in, Firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you or anyone else!"
49918,"After all this, I have to pick up and leave again?"
49922,"If you want to buy something, go find Sabjorn. Otherwise, piss off."
49923,Do you wish to aid in this cleansing?
49924,Hmph.
49925,"Oh, I do wish we could get to know each other better. But not now! I must tend to mother. See her settled."
49926,Why talk? Cicero has nothing to say to you. Call it a matter of... trust.
49927,"Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you."
49928,I've failed... the mortal has escaped.
49929,"Oh, but you didn't help poor Cicero! You helped that stupid farmer! Stupid Loreius! Oh, the guard said cruel things about us. Untrue things..."
49931,Rusted. Dry. There was a time when this mace dripped with the blood of the feeble and the worthless.
49932,"Ah, it doesn't matter. What's done is done, right? Cicero is here! As is the Night Mother! Joy of joys!"
49935,You mean nothing!
49938,He said I was transporting weapons! For the war! In mother's coffin! He made me... open it! Indignity! Sacrilege!
49939,You have a lot of nerve coming near me again. I'm still sore from what you did to me.
49941,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
49942,He said I attacked someone! On the road! But it never happened. Never. Sweet mother and I were just waiting. My knife was sheathed!
49945,"That's really not at the top of my list, no. Please, Camilla, I need you to focus."
49946,I don't want to talk about it.
49947,Your fellow Stormcloaks are already assembling outside the tomb. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm finished up here.
49949,"Imagine, blowing up an entire town. Damn College... Winterhold will never be the same."
49950,Oh stranger! You have made Cicero so happy! So jubilant and ecstatic! But more! Even more! My mother thanks you!
49952,Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter. Get yourself ready!
49953,That's what I like to hear.
49955,"My husband. We used to go out in the wilds and collect ingredients together. He used to call me his ""pretty Juniper."""
49956,Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice. Dragons also are able to absorb the power of their slain brethren.
49957,I'm itching for a fight.
49958,I think you and I have some things to talk about.
49959,I'm going to rest up here a while before heading to Windhelm. Be careful.
49961,"Go now, the artifact must be reclaimed and Malkoran destroyed."
49962,"Er, rather, have a nice day, citizen."
49963,A citizen of Winterhold has been kidnapped.
49964,"We're bound to find some gold in these ruins, but out of respect, let's leave a few coins for the dead."
49965,A citizen of the Pale has been kidnapped.
49967,"Don't rush your shot. Crouch down, get comfortable, and take aim."
49970,Only the best in all of Riften! I own Riften Fishery.
49971,A citizen of Falkreath has been kidnapped.
49972,"If we're not going to get Riften, we need you to give us something."
49973,"The Companions have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this."
49976,"Nords have always supported the Empire, and the Empire has always been good for Skyrim."
49977,"People are rightly stirred up about the damn Thalmor being allowed to roam around arresting people, just for worshipping Talos."
49979,"So did I! If the damn Stormcloaks somehow found one, or woke it up... the war might be about to take an ugly turn."
49981,"I know, I know... Wars to fight, dragons to confront, guild business to conduct."
49982,"They claim to be fighting for Skyrim's freedom, but the war is really all about Ulfric wanting to be High King of Skyrim."
49983,"Right, the leader of the Stormcloaks."
49984,"Incorrect. You can worship whatever gods you like. But Talos is a man, and only a heretic would think otherwise... "
49985,It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.
49986,"You see, Riften is my great beast to be slain and my fortune comes from gratitude and trust."
49987,"Dragging people off in the middle of the night... one of the main causes of this war, if you ask me."
49988,"Good. We'll take a short break, then move on to wide-area destruction spells."
49989,Places where you can overhear things. See things.
49993,"As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied."
49996,"A lack of ambition like that really ought to be punished. Perhaps by turning you into a worm, or maybe a few decades of..."
49997,"If he hadn't signed the peace treaty with the Thalmor, they would have destroyed the Empire - then where would Skyrim be?"
49999,"This must be her, then."
50000,"Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on this."
50001,We can head back whenever you're set. There's celebrating to be done!
50002,Hope you didn't catch any of the fire.
50003,Impressive work. We started the attack once you made the fog scamper away like that.
50006,"We have to wait for nighttime though. The other one is playing too, and she can't come out until then."
50007,"Had we aided them in releasing the Skull, they would use it to wreak havoc across Skyrim. They... they had to die."
50008,"Not too full on bread and wine, I hope?"
50009,Now I'm finally going to have some fun around here.
50012,Well I'll be! That'd be a sight to see.
50014,"You're right, I saw it. But... how's that possible? Dragons don't exist... they're just stories from long ago..."
50015,I'm glad you're here.
50017,I almost died in a ruin just like this.
50018,"It's a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy."
50019,M'aiq saw a mudcrab the other day. Horrible creatures. 
50020,"Like I said, name's Angi and I've been living out here for a couple of years now."
50021,"Die, you sonofa..."
50022,Mmmhmm.
50023,This place is huge.
50024,"He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War."
50027,So?
50029,"I thought you said these things were ""sleeping""?"
50030,"Son, when the Emperor's safety is concerned, anything could go wrong. Off with you, now. And good travels."
50031,"These are troubling times, indeed."
50032,There's no question about that. It was a mighty deed. You've earned a place of honor among the heroes of Whiterun.
50034,"But the token of my truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted by a profane darkness skittering within."
50035,Was something we discussed unclear?
50036,A little late in the day for your rounds Sorex.
50037,"She's an absolute pleasure to work for! In fact, I almost feel guilty accepting pay from her."
50039,But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?
50045,"I'm with you, Listener."
50047,Something doesn't feel right.
50051,I have the Lexicon! Where's the podium?
50052,"How wonderful. Like the sea, their love roils and swells, but brings life and nourishment to all."
50053,I can't hold these things! We need to leave!
50054,I did not come all the way here just to walk out empty-handed.
50055,"Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and you've already taken care of him."
50057,Help! Get that beast out of my house!
50058,I swear upon Lady Mara that I would never let any harm befall you.
50060,Here. This is for you.
50062,I doubt the Forsworn would risk holding this mine a second time. They lost many of their warriors.
50066,Did you notice that the snow settles in a different direction near the murder sites?
50067,These walking devices are strange yet amazing. What magic powers them?
50069,"Yes, Yes. It is an ancient and ruined city. Built by the Dwemer. The dwarf folk. It is nearby, but I'd stay clear. People say it is quite dangerous."
50070,Salmon sounds good today.
50072,You think I'd be in hiding if this was something I trusted town guards to handle?
50077,I shall have vengeance for the death of my husband. Rise!
50078,"Oh, it's not so terrible. I actually find the work quite relaxing."
50079,Sigh. Everyone isn't as short as you are... what good are these boards to someone of the proper height!?
50081,"I gave you what you came here for, now go. Leave me in peace."
50083,No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for!
50084,This isn't about religion or destiny. This is nothing more than a business transaction between yourself and Nocturnal.
50086,That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.
50089,"Well, come back when you have some more evidence. I think you're on the trail, though."
50090,Su'um ahrk morah.
50092,"A bit much, going around like that..."
50094,Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.
50096,"Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lass."
50097,"You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today."
50098,It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.
50099,"My sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure she'd help you out."
50101,"Now, you don't let Rogatus cause you any bother."
50102,There's no need to hide. I won't hurt you.
50103,Look for a way out! We are not going to burn to death in our own damned Sanctuary!
50106,There's a clear spot just west of Riften. You know the area?
50107,I don't like being out in the open like this.
50110,"Jarl Maven Black-Briar. Has a pleasant sound to it, wouldn't you say?"
50112,"I'll be right here, then."
50114,Hm. You're not from around here. Imperial spy perhaps?
50115,"They've made it their mission to hunt us down, but we are hunters ourselves."
50118,I'm glad Brynjolf decided to let me join. Been trying to make some coin for him ever since.
50120,Anything else?
50124,Give me a minute to examine the Star. I'll see what we'll need to do.
50129,Umm... Did you want somethin' to eat?
50130,By the Eight! You actually talked her into it?
50131,Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords.
50134,"Well now, that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time."
50135,"It's lies. All of it. I don't care what she told you, it's all lies."
50136,Don't you know? What drew you here? Surely your dreams showed you the way?
50138,"Thank you, I thought so, too."
50139,"Keep them coming and keep them strong, Valga."
50140,These Forsworn don't even have the decency to dress right.
50141,"What some call devotion to the dark arts, I call foolishness."
50143,"Men are complete pigs, am I right? All they care about is one thing... and you know exactly what I mean."
50144,"That would be a bad idea. I'd be too likely to attract the wrong kind of attention. But they don't know you at all, yet."
50146,"Hello, husband. You're rising late. You spent too long at the Sleeping Giant last night, didn't you?"
50148,Agh! It... hurts...
50149,"Do you hear that, Tullius? The blood of the innocent cries out for weregild."
50150,I thought about becoming a bandit. I decided I preferred clean clothes and fresh mead.
50151,Go away... please?
50152,There may be no enemy more foul than a walking corpse.
50153,"If the Forsworn aren't attacking my town, the Nords are trying to force me off it."
50155,It's as if the merchandise and coin are simply falling from the sky.
50156,"The way out is right there! Run, damn it!"
50157,"Sorry, fresh out. Maybe next time."
50158,Here's the noble Empire in all its glory. Pah.
50159,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
50160,"Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't do this. You can't!"
50161,Rlyehhhgh1
50162,"Very well, just let me know when you're ready to purchase the house."
50164,I'll bathe in your blood!
50165,"I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse."
50166,"The only reason I stopped fighting was a plea from Laila, otherwise I'd would have fought to the death."
50167,I can see why they built the fort here. A small force could control most of the nearby land.
50169,Do you think Tiber Septim ever fought here?
50170,He's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
50175,Can't a man have a bit of privacy? Get out of here!
50176,That explains what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I was hoping I was wrong about what I thought it was...
50177,Just look at this place. I've seen better workmanship from Nord children only ten winters old.
50178,Keep to the shadows.
50179,Just look at this place. Is this what passes for a fort in Skyrim?
50181,This smell of dank earth and worm-eaten wood is going to make me lose my last meal.
50182,"When I was a child, I dreamed about having a fort like this all to myself."
50183,"You're not from here, and we don't need to be talking."
50184,Whoops.
50187,"End of the road. Markarth, right on schedule."
50188,"I'll give it a try, thanks very much."
50189,It's amazing this place is so well preserved. There isn't even a hint of rust.
50190, 
50192,This place is amazing! It's hard to believe that mortal hands built them.
50193,"I've heard that you can sell Dwemer artifacts on the black market down in Cyrodiil. They fetch a handsome price, too."
50194,Hey!
50195,Take your seat and we can begin.
50196,I wonder why the Dwemer came to Skyrim. Why did they build this place? I suppose we'll never know.
50197,I've half a mind to dismantle one of these Dwemer machines. I'd like to see how it works.
50199,Ha ha ha ha ha! You wish to defeat me? Impossible.
50200,"The Dwemer created so many wondrous machines, and yet nobody ever followed in their footsteps. Why is that, I wonder?"
50201,I wonder what keeps these machines working so long after their masters disappeared.
50202,"I'm sorry, I can't help you."
50203,"Yes, yes. What is it? We're all very busy here..."
50204,"My goodness, it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down in the Midden, but I haven't checked."
50205,Well... I guess you could say I got on his nerves. I tend to be the voice of reason and he finds that... irksome.
50206,Come with me. It is time for us to recognize you formally as Dragonborn.
50207,"A living Dwemer was once discovered in Morrowind. Can you imagine it, being the last surviving member of your race?"
50208,"Honor to you, my Thane."
50209,"It's unnatural, building all these machines. If you ask me, the Dwemer got what they deserved."
50210,What good is a sword or an axe against an enemy made of brass and steel?
50212,There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.
50213,"This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them."
50214,He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.
50215,"The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans."
50216,"You ready yet? I need to get back before I'm missed. Remember, you won't have anything except what I smuggle in for you."
50219,Jarl Igmund can't ignore us for much longer. Not if the Silver-Blood family has a say.
50221,Lun!
50224,"Plunder these ruins at your peril, friend. The spirits of the dead won't look kindly upon it."
50225,A citizen of Eastmarch has been kidnapped.
50228,Please don't bother the Arch-Mage unless it's absolutely necessary.
50229,That takes care of that.
50231,"But... well, they did. Sacred, they said. So we work the mines until we've worked it off. Fair enough, I guess."
50232,"You have all fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring us to this point."
50233,Remember to check behind you every once in a while. Who knows what might try to sneak up on us.
50235,I suppose you intend to carry off every item of value in these ruins.
50236,"Mark these words carefully, fetcher. Stay away from my family, or I will paint the ground with your blood."
50238,"Do try not to set off any traps, will you?"
50239,Not now.
50240,Be gone!
50243,"I wonder what the ancient Nords did in these ruins. Unspeakable sacrifices, maybe?"
50245,I'll bet some of these artifacts would fetch a good price. I hope they're not cursed.
50246,"Erm... no. Not yet. I'm sorry, I was reading up on the effects of distillation."
50248,"Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room."
50249,"Few would dare to trespass in these ruins. What you lack in wisdom, you make up for in courage."
50251,It is strange to think that these chambers were once home to the ancient Nords.
50252,"You have to understand, his presence here has caused... Well, it's difficult for the people to get used to."
50255,"Markarth is a city of wealth, but gold doesn't follow you in death."
50256,"It takes uncommon strength to work the mines in Skyrim. The earth here is cold and hard, like the heart of a Nord."
50257,You know what I miss the most right now? Fresh air.
50258,"Certainly nothing illicit going on here, Arch-Mage. You can be quite sure of that."
50260,"Now, I know what you're thinking - this is no spoon, it's a fork! Nobody can eat soup with a fork!"
50262,I seem to have misplaced the book I was reading.
50263,I wonder what they were mining down here.
50264,My brother was the best man in Solitude.
50266,It would be easy for someone -- or something -- to sneak up on us down here.
50267,"I've sent some men to scout out the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort."
50268,"Please, I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city."
50269,"My nose and mouth are so full of dust, I can hardly breath."
50270,"The fewer of these mines we venture into, the happier I'll be."
50271,I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.
50273,"But when you can sniff out a vein of iron like me, it isn't too much trouble."
50274,"We're with you, Dragonborn."
50275,How deep is this cave?
50276,Make your way to our hidden camp in the Rift. I can't continue to push forward when I'm worried about Eastmarch's southern border.
50277,"Oh, but... I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any... inconveniences."
50278,The vessels contain that very blood. Empty them and you remove any chance he has of regaining his former powers.
50281,There are strange echoes in these caves. Keep you eyes open.
50282,"Gods willing, we'll find a chest full of gold in one of these chambers."
50283,"You said they were sleeping. I said they were waiting. It seems a few of them were ""waiting"" for someone to try and take the Lexicon."
50284,Mind your step. I think I spied a patch of ice on the floor.
50286,Your end draws near!
50287,"Now, do you have a reason for making such a mess?"
50288,The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.
50289,"By Azura, what's happening?"
50290,It's a small group of us here at the College. Favors don't go unremembered. Neither do affronts.
50295,"Dengeir deserves more respect than his nephew, Jarl Siddgeir, affords him."
50300,Careful. Our footsteps will echo in every chamber and tunnel.
50304,"Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business."
50307,People say Skyrim is one of the most dangerous places in Tamriel. I think they're wrong... it's magnificent and I'm proud to call it home.
50308,"I love the cold air... it's exhilarating. Perhaps it's because of my Nord blood, but there's something about it that makes me feel alive."
50311,You should have seen me at the height of my adventuring career... I was fearless and took too many risks. But that's what it was all about.
50313,They used to be something. Nowadays they just squabble amongst themselves.
50314,Exploring these caves feels like coming home. I missed this.
50316,"Danger's about, I can tell. Be cautious."
50318,Your rewards in life will match the strength of your faith.
50319,"Hmm. I guess I'll defer to your judgment on this one, but I think it's a mistake."
50320,"I've told you a hundred times, I lock that chest for a reason. I don't want you getting a head full of ideas about adventure and glory."
50322,Markarth. Is it bloody enough for you?
50323,Keep your eyes open for ambushes. These forts have too many blind corners.
50324,"If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again."
50325,Perhaps we can find some treasure if we search the grounds of the fort thoroughly.
50326,"Capable as she may be, I don't see any signs of her being this, what, ""Dragonborn."""
50327,"But it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones."
50328,"So long ""friend."" Ha ha ha!"
50329,"If there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that draugr burn like tinder. We could use that to our advantage."
50330,Be aware of rune traps on the ground or else this could be a very short expedition.
50331,Don't let the vampires strike you or else you may get infected with their blood poisoning.
50332,There's a new museum opening up in Dawnstar. The owner is asking me to hand out invitations to travelers.
50334,"I miss those days, before the Forsworn took up arms again, when you could walk the roads in peace."
50335,Vampires... an unclean lot. It will be a pleasure to clear this place.
50336,"Bunch of distractions, if you ask me. They just interrupt the rest of my work."
50337,You want answers? Well so do I. So does everyone in this city.
50339,Whiterun is a such beautiful city. Have you ever seen the likes of this place?
50341,"Ah, Winterhold. I've always wanted to visit this place. The secrets locked inside must be astounding."
50343,"Terrible, just terrible. I vastly underestimated the heat transfer necessary, and have destroyed my only working model. I'm at a loss."
50345,"A venison pie, maybe? With a nice cup of mulled mead?"
50347,Ralof seems to like you. That's good enough for me.
50348,I was recruited as an acolyte of Vaermina as a young elf. I had no real childhood to speak of... we weren't permitted to socialize.
50350,"I've done a lot of... questionable things in my life. Serving Vaermina was a horrible mistake, and I hope Mara will forgive me one day."
50354,Trust in Mara... she'll protect us in this dark place.
50355,Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.
50356,Why anything would chose to reside down here is beyond me.
50357,"These ruins are old, maybe a thousand years or more."
50359,"Ugh, this place... horrible."
50360,"As for myself, you've proven your mastery twice over. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly acknowledge the power of your Thu'um."
50363,I've never been inside a dwarven ruin. They are simply astounding.
50366,I served as a healer in a fort not unlike this one long ago.
50368,"So, why'd you join the Stormcloaks?"
50369,"When I was a young acolyte of Vaermina, I paid my dues in a shrine located within the catacombs of a fort in Cyrodiil."
50371,I thought I heard footsteps. Be careful.
50372,Bandits are the worst lot. They'd steal from their own mothers given the chance.
50376,"Look how persistent you are. It's charming, really."
50377,"In order to learn and use this Shout, you will be taking this evil into yourself."
50378,"I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master."
50380,Being a priest of Vaermina put me very close to dark sorcery at its worst.
50383,"Her Benevolence has taught me patience and mercy, but these vampires deserve none of it."
50384,"No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title."
50387,I've always wanted to make a pilgrimage here to the Temple of Mara. Thank you for bringing me here... you've made me quite happy.
50388,"""Check the shipments"" Lisbet says. ""There are no shipments"" I says."
50389,We should bow our heads in silent reverence for those who are interred in Falkreath's cemetery.
50391,A sword? I remember a legend that Tiber Septim had attacked one of the enemy camps before he came to Old Hroldan. It could be there.
50396,You can return this axe to the man who sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain... visitors.
50397, 
50398,I'll... I can... just...
50399,I see... it looks like Suvaris has been traveling to Dawnstar to meet with a pirate crew there.
50401,"The guards are looking for a killer, but who knows what else they might turn up? Good day."
50403,Now if you'll excuse me...
50406,"Ah, excellent. Well, here's the gold the Jarl offered in exchange for taking care of the problem."
50407,"Drem. Patience. I am answering, in my way."
50408,"On this glorious day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!"
50409,"Between the two of us, his family is better off thinking he's dead."
50412,"Bryling's obsession with honor and tradition is quaint, but politically irrelevant."
50413,"See what you can figure out auxillary, I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something."
50414,"They're not the sort to take visitors, but I never go that high up the path anyway."
50421,"Well, no... I... I mean..."
50422,But that day has not come yet.
50423,Be glad to repair any damage to your Guild armor.
50424,There's a new guard nosing around the meadery. Can you do something about it?
50425,"A great darkness is growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or abroad. "
50426,"The Stormcloaks are named after Ulfric. He's a bad man, but don't tell the soldiers that."
50427,I presume you're bothering me for a good reason?
50429,"Don't worry, I am."
50430,Hmph. If you see my good-for-nothing husband Leifnarr on your journeys tell him he's no longer welcome here.
50431,"If it's the war you're referring to, I'm on the side of Whiterun."
50432,"Yes, you're innocent. As innocent as anyone can be in this city."
50434,"Probably not, but it's worth a try!"
50435,"Hey, I want to talk to you... now."
50436,"Do well here, and you'll be a full member of the Companions. "
50437,Who were you fighting against?
50438,Hopefully Skaggi will send word to the Jarl and something will be done.
50439,Did you need something?
50440,Now that's interesting. Tell me more.
50441,Don't mind if you do. What's your price?
50442,There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe.
50443,"Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead?"
50444,By the Nine...
50449,Takes a fair bit of strength to carry a greatsword like that. But can you use it?
50450,"I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!"
50452,I can hardly believe it.
50453,Hiding only prolongs the inevitable.
50454,We will find her eventually.
50456,Hmm? What is it?
50457,Well that's where I want to build. In the fall forest. Give it an easterly view. The sunrise is almost as pretty as you are.
50460,The Snow-Shod's are very trusting to let me run this place without their supervision.
50461,My mother spares no expense where I'm concerned. I'm heir to the family fortune after all.
50464,"After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place."
50465,They're the high elves that rule the Aldmeri Dominion. Sworn enemies of the Empire and everything it stands for.
50467,What's in that book? What did it say?
50469,"Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring?"
50470,"Of course. Don't forget to keep out of sight, it doesn't count if they catch you red-handed. You ready?"
50471,My niece died. Things won't be the same without her.
50472,"Anyway, I can smell the smoke. They've already set the place alight."
50473,"Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk to Kodlak Whitemane. "
50475,"Remember, we have proof and all he's got is his word."
50476,Then we show them Gallus's journal and hope for the best.
50477,"It's a shocking request, I know. But it is inside the purview of what you Dark Brotherhood types do. Isn't it? If history is to be believed?"
50479,The Stonefist's no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it first.
50480, 
50482,"They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back."
50483,I know you... everyone's been talking about it. What are you here for?
50484,The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun.
50485,I wish we could have absolved your brother-in-law of his sins before his execution.
50486,Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. That's the way it is. That's the way it'll stay.
50487,I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.
50488,Born and raised right here in Rorikstead.
50489,"I'm sorry, Legate. I didn't want to imply anything about your ability to lead. You're a hero to the Empire, and I...."
50492,No. I live in a nice house in Solitude where the air isn't filled with smoke from the silver smelters and golden-haired girls shine my shield.
50494,"At the market, father."
50495,It's right there in the name of the most powerful family in Markarth. The Silver-Bloods.
50499,"Why are you bothering me, outsider?"
50502,The only thing I'll tell you about Markarth is stay out of our business. We have enough around here without some outsider causing trouble. 
50503,Then you're talking to the wrong man. You want that elf in the keep. Calcelmo.
50504,"Madame Ambassador, you know that I would never have behaved... that is to say... well I swear I'm innocent this time!"
50506,"I don't. Go bother Kleppr at the Silver-Blood Inn, he handles the newcomers."
50507,"Bring them to me - but be careful, mortal. They are guarded by Hevnoraak's minions. They will stop at nothing to see their master return. "
50508,"And once you've had your fill of mead, do us all a favor and go home. Markarth has enough trouble."
50510,"I suppose if you're intent on looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative."
50512,Mother says I shouldn't talk to people...
50516,You've been a good friend to me. That means something.
50517,We're taking Falkreath. Get over there with the others. Fight well or die well.
50519,"But a girl has to grow up, and life in the stronghold asked for a lot in return, so I joined the Legion. Mastered my trade there."
50521,Hurry!
50522,"Please, come home. Just... Just come home."
50523,"Wujeeta, you're worrying me. You look so... well, so sad."
50524,That's right. An Orc stronghold. Kept to ourselves. Lived as our ancestors would have wanted.
50526,You strike your metal like a new mother giving her babe a light slap. Hit it harder.
50527,"What am I supposed to do? Never leave the house? You want that, Endon?"
50529,I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Darkness.
50530,"Mama, why are you and papa fighting?"
50531,Master Wulfgar will demonstrate Whirlwind Sprint. Then it will be your turn.
50532,"See what you can figure out, Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something."
50533,Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?
50534,Maybe. I'll see if I feel like it.
50535,You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat!
50538,"Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim."
50540,For a generous fellow traveler? But of course. What would you like to hear?
50541,"Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!"
50542,"Sure, what can I do for you?"
50544,Of course! You don't remember getting here.
50546,"Well all right, then."
50548,"Well, spit it out. What's the matter?"
50551,The Greybeards are a strange bunch.
50557,"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
50558,"Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how our luck behaves?"
50559,"My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
50560,"I've turned over every body, though, and I can't find him."
50561,Nobody pilfers property on my watch.
50564,Did he now?
50570,"What do you say, Irileth? You're being awfully quiet."
50572,"My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
50573,"You'd make a better Imperial ranger than me. I may have charmed the locals, but my fellow soldiers hated my waggling tongue."
50574,I can teach you a few things.
50576,What?
50579,Is Hroggar innocent or not?
50580,"Here, my friend. A few septims, to show my thanks, hmm? And may that twisted little jester rot in a cell for a fortnight! "
50583,Do you like my pretty tower?
50585,"You won't like it, my lady."
50587,"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as khajiit, but as dovah!"
50588,"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as orc, but as dovah!"
50589,"Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as elf, but as dovah!"
50592,"Yes, I know. As does Astrid. You have done well, and have earned both your reward, and a bonus, as I may have mentioned."
50595,Too bad. That one's my favorite.
50596,Much snow in Skyrim. Enough snow. M'aiq does not want any more. 
50598,Ah. I have expected you. Prodah.
50599,"I cannot teach you the Shout, because I do not know it."
50601,"Nid. If you wish me to answer your question, you must answer mine."
50602,Why we bothered to capture Riften I'll never understand. Just look at this place.
50604,"Yes. Alduin... zeymah. The elder brother. Gifted, grasping and troublesome as is so often the case with firstborn."
50606,"No, and after what you've discovered I fear the worst for them."
50607,"You will?! Oh, thank you!"
50608,"You heard what she said, Tullius."
50609,"And thus, you're not skilled enough to be a candidate. I'm afraid we're not interested."
50610,"Some would say that all things must end, so that the next can come to pass."
50611,"Pruzah. As good a reason as any. There are many who feel as you do, although not all."
50616,The Stormcloaks will never stop us.
50620,Paaz. A fair answer.
50621,"Dahmaan - remember, Alduin also follows his destiny, as he sees it."
50623,I've never felt this brave.
50625,"And so, perhaps, your destiny will be fulfilled. Who can say?"
50626,"Drem. All in good time. First, a question for you. Why do you want to learn this Thu'um?"
50628,"Oh Jon, darling. You know you're the only stone-biting, knuckle-dragging Nord for me."
50629,"Oh, yes. Of course... the whole thane thing. I'd forgotten. If you're ready then, can we get this out of the way?"
50633,Aren't you already running a job for Skjor? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
50634,"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
50636,"I've already given you a job, now get to it."
50637,"Yes, you've made that quite clear in the past. And now we have Urog and Dushnamub because of your weakness."
50638,"Everyone is this city is so on edge. I could use some good news, Skulvar."
50640,"Falkreath is known for its graveyard, traveler. We've buried more dead than you can imagine."
50641,The Jarl of the Rift has asked for our help.
50642,"Who knows, maybe he's in a generous mood."
50643,"So you think you have what it takes? Huh. Lucky for you, I'm not the one who makes that decision. Talk to Kodlak."
50645,"Likewise, the College of Whispers has long been driven by its desire to directly oppose the Synod."
50647,Right. Good thing they've already let you into their little cult. Not likely they'd help Esbern or me if we came calling.
50648,Please proceed into the Embassy.
50650,"What about ""Auntie Faida"" in Dragon Bridge? She runs a bar, and you said she's one of your favorite girls!"
50651,I've been hearing rumors of Silver Hand activity.
50652,Well... that was an unpleasant bit of business.
50655,"Sorry, love, but I'm not a charity."
50656,"The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may destroy your College and this world."
50657,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
50659,This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.
50661,"Thanks, sister. I knew we could count on you."
50662,Hurt him while he is grounded!
50665,"I picked up a trick from a butcher in Elinhir, a small town over the border in Hammerfell."
50666,"It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process."
50668,"Depends. Are you thirsty, hungry, both?"
50670,Thank you. Do hurry please.
50673,"Here you go, for your trouble."
50674,"No, you don't want to go up there! A dragon... it's attacking!"
50676,"In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!"
50677,That's a fine potion you've put together.
50679,Poor mother... Her new home seems so very far...
50680,Poor mother... she's been waiting here so long... Stupid farmer and his stupid tools! Why won't he help us?
50681,And sabotage enemy controlled resources.
50685,Outrageous! Who does she think she is?!
50686,"If that's what she wants, then that's what she'll get."
50687,I think I hear my daughter calling...
50688,"I was one of the best soldiers in the Stormcloak army, until I took a sword through the chest."
50689,"Little fool's going to experience the hard reality of Skyrim justice, eh?"
50690,I'll be sure to stress your urgency. It seems like every farmer in Skyrim is short on supplies these days.
50691,What'd you say to me? Get out! I never want to see you again.
50692,Well? Is it done? Have you reported the fool to the guard?
50693,Someone do something!
50696,You need to report that crazy jester to the guard. He should be patrolling the road.
50697,"I'll soon arrange transportation for our little friend. Don't worry, he'll rot in a cell and pay for what he's done."
50700,The summoning of undead is even less advisable outside of the College.
50706,No! You're going to break it!
50707,Any idea how I can get my daughter's head out of the clouds?
50708,"You could report the fool. You know, say he's done something against the law. That will at least get rid of him for me. What do you say?"
50709,"Remind us of our place, when we forget."
50710,Got a message from one of my people that this place just came into some coin. Should be a good target. Want to take it?
50711,He seemed convinced that she'd run off with someone named Vex. That's all I remember.
50712,"If that business proposition includes smuggling, forget it."
50713,Poor Banning. Twice as much work here in the stables without him.
50714,Ulfric was a true hero of Skyrim. He will be missed.
50715,"Oh, splendid! I can't wait to use them."
50716,Hmm. We shall see.
50719,What?
50720,"I work at the lumber mill, but I escape into the forest whenever possible."
50721,Got any ale or mead?
50722,I'm aware of who stole Frost. And why.
50723,"In his later years, Andoril moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments."
50726,"Like I said, the guard is down by the road. You really can't miss him."
50728,I'm taking mother to a new home. A new crypt. But... aggh! Wagon wheel! Damnedest wagon wheel! It broke! Don't you see?
50730,"Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second."
50731,"By your scent, I'd say you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore."
50732,"Poor Cicero is stuck. Can't you see? I was transporting my dear, sweet mother. Well, not her. Her corpse! She's quite dead."
50733,I'm going to check that out.
50735,"Should you ever fall victim to an unfortunate accident, I promise your remains will be put to good use..."
50736,Lot krongrah. You truly have the Voice of a dovah. Alduin's allies will think twice after this victory.
50738,Ready to spill some Imperial blood for Skyrim?
50742,"If you want to try, but I'll keep my dagger sharpened just in case."
50743,The Nightgate and Candlehearth inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.
50745,Aren't you wonderful! Why can't your father be more like you and your sister?
50746,"When questioned by the Black Door, answer with the correct passphrase: ""Silence, my brother."" Then you're in. And your new life begins."
50747,I feared as much. I thought it was him we saw flying east after your battle.
50750,Just... die!
50752,"We'd be better off without the Silver-Bloods. They send their brute, Yngvar, to shake some coins from me every few days."
50754,"The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what I mean?"
50759,We'll keep peace and order in Dawnstar.
50760,King Olaf was Olaf One-Eye? He famously captured the dragon Numinex and took him to Dragonsreach. What do we say really happened?
50761,They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.
50762,Sabjorn could use this interruption to his advantage and collect a larger share of the market. I can't have that.
50764,"If my cleanin' gets in your way, just say the word an' I'll be off."
50767, 
50769,You're not as dumb as you look.
50770,"Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!"
50774,A storeroom. See if you can find any potions. We'll need them.
50776,The cowards!
50777,Really? Good. Was there a lot of screaming? Never mind. I don't want to know.
50778,"More tea, Pelly my dear?"
50779,But then... out of nowhere... a dragon attacked...
50780,"Stay out of my way, boot."
50781,"You don't mean, a real, live..."
50785,"As strange as it sounds, we'd be dead if not for that dragon. In the confusion, we managed to slip away."
50786,Wait... you mean you killed every last one of them? I can't believe it!
50789,I refuse to believe Alva had anything to do with this. There is no way you can prove it to the Jarl.
50790,"Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow."
50791,Any friend of Ralof's is a friend of mine.
50794,Tiid krent. Time was... shattered here because of what the ancient Nords did to Alduin.
50795,"Right. Well. If you have some kind of official business with the jarl, I'm afraid now's not the time. Go on then. Off with you."
50796,"Mind your mother, boy!"
50797,Did you really see a dragon?
50802,"It's working, Galmar. Our patience has won us friends and allies. And our armies are systematically taking care of the rest."
50803,"If it's a mercenary you're looking for, you've found him. There's no stronger sword-arm for hire in all Skyrim."
50807,Don't worry. I'm sure he made it out. It'll take more than a dragon to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.
50809,"What? The Augur? Oh no, I'm quite sure that's... He's nothing I'm involved in. No, no."
50810,"Look, he says we needed coin, so I got coin. Who cares if people got hurt? Blood washes off septims."
50812,"Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure! Cicero will remain the happy Keeper."
50813,"Because big, bad Brynjolf doesn't like the way I play thief."
50820,There's also the matter of your payment. I believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.
50823,He's making too much racket and I'm trying to get Vex drunk. So I tell him to keep it down and he just runs me through.
50824,"Since nobody's trying to kill me just now, maybe we should rest for a minute."
50828,Dreh ni nahkip. Discipline against the lesser aids in qahnaar... denial of the greater.
50829,"Capturing that dragon was a mighty deed. In my younger days, I'd have been the first to join in the attempt."
50831,"No, it was Svidi's brother, Wulfur. She's in hiding now. Somewhere far from here I'd suspect."
50832,The shadows will be your undoing!
50835,"I think you've had plenty, Vulwulf. Maybe you should head on home."
50836,Do you have business with the East Empire Company?
50839,What's done is done.
50842,Ayarg garag gar!
50845,I will return...
50847,I beg you... please. This is not what it seems!
50848,And you... you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's prisons.
50849,It wasn't easy getting all your things. A few guards had to have their throats slit.
50850,Are you serious? You're as crazy as Maramal.
50852,I had Kaie recover all the things the Nords stole from you. You better get ready before we break out into the city.
50853,I told her. I told her the imperial army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it.
50854,Toor!
50855,Good job!
50856,Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!
50857,May the blessings of the Eight be with you.
50860,"You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself."
50866,I'm shopping. Excuse me.
50867,Hadvar... get away from there!
50871,I left behind my daughter Uaile when I was taken.
50873,"Filthy creatures, aren't they? Living in the darkness, like they do. So uncivilized."
50874,"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Ice Wolf pelts."
50875,"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Sabre Cat pelts."
50878,"No, don't go!"
50880,Been mining all my life. Quicksilver is as much my home as anywhere.
50881,Have you... Do you see that future? Will I be a good leader?
50882,The Imperials silence us because they fear us! They are cowards! Cowards and fools who have forgotten the truth! 
50883,I feel so alive!
50884,The Rift is seeing a lot of trouble from some riff-raff. We need to head in and break them up.
50886,"And I would deserve it, wouldn't I?"
50888,I'm afraid to touch half of the things we keep in the tower.
50891,"Quick, I can cut you loose inside the keep."
50893,Oh. Oh I see.
50894,"I mean, I'd hate to leave now and find out later you met some horrible fate at the hands of the Caller."
50895,"It's a problem with the Forsworn. Unpredictable, unknowable, and dangerous. Be careful."
50896,The Falmer. There have been reports that they've been attacking people at night.
50897,I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone.
50898,"Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left buried away."
50900,Bah...Qo!
50902,Excellent. Show them no mercy.
50903,"We can trade in the morning, outlander."
50906,My children all grew up and left Dawnstar to make their fortune.
50907,"Shame. But, I'm sure one of the whelps around here will take it up."
50910,"It's amazing how much work goes into the little things, isn't it?"
50911,Good luck.
50913,We've received a desperate missive.
50915,"You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily."
50919,We are creatures of the desert. The north wind chills us to the bones.
50924,"Until he's dead... well, I'm sorry, but we would dishonor our oaths as Blades if we continued to help you."
50928,"If you say Cicero has gone there, it stands to reason that he's familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own ground."
50929,"You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation on trust in your good name. But it seems you intend to favor Ulfric."
50930,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
50931,I've killed legions like you!
50933,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
50934,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
50935,Now that's what I call a punch. You got me.
50936,"Oh, this pendant would look lovely on my sister."
50937,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
50938,"Careful, now. Wouldn't want someone to get... burned."
50939,"Got business here in Riverwood, eh? There are worse villages."
50942,"For twenty-five years I ran, never sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks."
50944,"Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients."
50948,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
50949,"Well, no. I'm just saying there's more to defense than muscle."
50951,Try dripping blood onto the carving on the floor.
50952,The kind that evaluates your usefulness during... duress.
50953,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
50955,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
50956,Absolutely no time to deal with lowlifes these days. Go away.
50958,"Whether or not he has truly repented, or merely acted to save himself, justice demands that he pay with his life."
50959,"Now, then. I been gabbin' long enough. Too much cleanin' to do."
50960,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
50962,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
50964,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
50966,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
50967,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
50968,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
50971,I don't know why... but I actually believe you. You've got the look of someone who's just seen a dragon.
50972,"When I'm known throughout Tamriel, you'll regret this decision."
50973,"Not bad, not bad. The intensity of the hunt is special, isn't it?"
50975,I consider even talking to the Empire a generous gesture.
50978,I've already removed the boards so the meadery would get infested. That's where you should start.
50979,"Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn."
50980,Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests infesting the meadery.
50982,"We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here."
50984,"Normally, I would have welcomed someone like you -- resourceful, clearly no friend of the Empire."
50985,"Remember, you don't get paid until they're all dead."
50986,Now I've got to clean up this mess.
50989,"This is the land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part in making it strong again."
50990,Good luck. I'll be here if you need me.
50992,"I'll just be here, then."
50994,"Orcish armor, hmm? Had me a set of that once. Ugly and strong, like those that forged it."
50995,Hopefully they made it to safety before the attack.  I'll begin the search after a quick restock.
51000,"Have you seen Refnir? I told him to check out the well drain, but he never reported back."
51003,The Jarl of Eastmarch has asked for our help.
51004,The Jarl of the Pale has asked for our help.
51006,The Jarl of Falkreath has asked for our help.
51009,The Jarl of the Reach has asked for our help.
51015,Ah. You must mean that one over there. He's not one of us.
51016,"Push off, will you?"
51017,"You here to see Rulindil, too, eh? None of my business of course."
51018,"A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for yourself."
51019,"Vittoria may be pretty, but does she have the right hips for the job? I want grandchildren, and lots of them."
51020,"Sounds fair. She's yours. Like I said, she's all saddled."
51021,"Don't worry, though. You will find all three Words in Ustengrav."
51022,What did you tell him? Why did you do this to me?
51024,"Are you heading to Whiterun? Could you take this letter to the priestess, Danica Pure-Spring? It's a note about Joric's health."
51025,There's got to be some way out of here!
51026,Not right now. Anything new?
51027,I don't know where I'll go. Somewhere far away from here.
51029,What? Why? But... you must have said something to Erikur! You lied to him and now here I am! You're a heartless monster!
51030,"We're stretched thin in Solitude, and I don't expect these bandits to be much challenge. Are you ready?"
51031,You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand.
51033,Well done. Here's your gold.
51038,"If you go there, talk to Viarmo. He's the headmaster."
51039,At the Bards College in Solitude. They train bards and skalds like myself.
51041,You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.
51042,Mara protect us both.
51043,Only in that I'm a graduate. I work over at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
51044,Hey! What the... keep your damn magic to yourself.
51045,Let's just not take the chance. We can talk about this later.
51046,It is. We train the bards you hear throughout the land. Viarmo is the head of the college and in charge of admissions.
51049,"Faendal thinks he can woo Camilla Valerius away from me. She's already mine, I keep telling him."
51050,Elisif mourns her husband deeply and she feels that a festival that burns a King in effigy is... distasteful.
51051,"No. If we must fight, we will, and you will lead us to victory. As you always have."
51052,My carriage is the safest way to travel.
51055, 
51057,"To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the verse was lost long ago."
51060,What's he doing? Looking for rubies in rubbish? Get a job!
51061,"Ah wonderful, I knew it would be. This is a significant find."
51062,And the parts that are readable... well... bardic verse has come a long way since ancient times.
51064,"It means that the Burning of King Olaf, which the Bards College has held for time immemorial, won't be happening."
51066,If she isn't convinced of the festival's importance then she won't reverse her decision to stop the effigy burning.
51069,It means I can't read it to the court. Without the verse I won't be able to convince Elisif of the importance of The Burning of King Olaf Festival.
51072,Make it up? That doesn't seem appropriate...
51073,"I'm ready, let's continue."
51074,"No matter what, the College will endure."
51075,"Ha! All right, I'm writing that in. I'm not sure about the court but I find that much more probable than Olaf capturing a dragon."
51077,"I don't fight for the glory of the Empire, nor do I glory in the death of my kinsmen. I fight to bring peace and order to my homeland."
51078,You're right. Let Tullius be the one to insult the Greybeards by refusing their summons.
51079,Pathetic human!
51080,"As time passed, a thriving community sprang up around Jorrvaskr, as was common with mead halls."
51081,My only concern is for the children. The poor darlings have no one else.
51082,I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back.
51084,"What? Oh, nothing. It's just... It's an interesting development."
51085,I don't want to fight you again.
51087,Glad to see you finally came to to your senses. Ready to make some coin?
51091,We prefer not to announce that the Sybil has died until we can introduce the new one. People like to know that we're connected to the goddess.
51093,"I swear, that Aeri and her men would make fine Stormcloak recruits. Pity we can't spare the lumber to conscript them."
51100,"And the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled!"
51101,You remind me of myself a few years ago. Let me show you a little bit about wearing light armor. It's helped me out whenever I was scouting.
51102,"Come on, close the door."
51103,Like a stone.
51104,And take this. It's blessed with the old magicks. Something to remember me by.
51106,"You have proven your point, Viarmo.  The festival is truly a celebration of Solitude and a condemnation of false kings."
51109,"I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see."
51110,"You one of those ""Skyrim for the Nords"" types?"
51112,"Thank you yet again. I will make sure our applicant, who was instrumental in... recovering the poem will be well rewarded."
51114,"If the river is not frozen to ice, perhaps."
51117,I need you to go speak to Jorn. He was preparing the Effigy of King Olaf. 
51118,But the world is a dangerous place. Erik has no idea what he's getting himself into.
51122,"Wuunferth? Bah. It's purely ceremonial, and he has no use for it."
51124,"No, that's pushing it too far. Very exciting but highly unlikely, I can't possibly write that in."
51127,"All the miners, farmers, and laborers in the Reach get their daily wages through us."
51128,"When the Thalmor want something, they tell you straight. In my experience, they have no interest in subtleties and innuendo. "
51129,Did you need something?
51131,That's the best I can offer.
51132,"Welcome to Riften, traveler. I hope the road fared well for you."
51133,"If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off limits."
51134,She won't tell me her name.
51137,Someday I'll be Jarl. Mother reminds me often. I hope I can help the people of Morthal the way she has.
51138,Can't a man drink in peace?
51139,A citizen of the Pale has asked for our help.
51140,"I'm good with stars and charts, but I admit I've got some things to learn about leading men."
51141,A citizen of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.
51142,I can't wait to be invisible.
51143,No. I have my pride.
51144,You've done your duty and we're all very grateful. Now... I'd like to eat.
51146,"First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it."
51147,Get over to the capital! We're mounting our final attack!
51152,"Jarl Igmund sits on the Mournful Throne. You can find him in the keep, in the back end of the city inside the mountain."
51153,Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks... I'd check under the water near one of the small islands in the lake.
51154,"You're our favorite kind of traveler, then. The market area is just inside in the gate."
51157,"You think it's money I need? I'm a prisoner, not a beggar."
51161,"If it's true, and you do have the Voice, would you mind showing me? I've never seen it first-hand."
51164,"The Dark Brotherhood? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think this is the first contract I've had on my life?"
51166,"Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there."
51169,Purpose? I should think it's self-evident.
51170,"That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar!"
51172,"I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?"
51175,"I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?"
51177,"I was about to let that wench marry into the richest family in Riften, and this is how she repays me."
51184,We have guests as often as we can but there aren't a lot of travellers these days. The war keeps people off the roads.
51187,"We may not have as much to offer as Whiterun or Solitude, but we'll do what we can to make your stay a pleasant one."
51188,That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius.
51190,I sell cases of it for half of what the inns and taverns pay through the Meadery.
51191,"No, no friend. You've got it all wrong. I'm not selling cheap mead. I'm selling good mead for cheap... Black-Briar Mead."
51193,So far so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out.
51195,Can you believe that this hold used to contend for the throne of the High King? Now perhaps others will listen.
51196,I'll wait here.
51198,"All right, pipe down. You want the whole blessed place to hear you?"
51200,The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the Nightingales are sworn to protect with their lives.
51202,"You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer."
51205,"You ask me, not enough of Winterhold fell off into the sea."
51206,Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.
51208,Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within the walls of the Sepulcher.
51213,"Well, if it isn't my little problem-solver."
51214,Orc chiefs should be strong and stand alone. They need no companions. Progeny is a poor excuse.
51215,"Today I'll teach you a useful spell that might just save your life. If you should ever fall into a river, you'll be very glad you learned it."
51216,You demand payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves.
51217,"Here, take this as a bit of a reward for nabbing our little thief."
51222,"If I have to hold your hand through everything, maybe you aren't cut out for this kind of work."
51223,You're not getting that treasure.
51225,You should see Gharol if you're looking for a blade or armor.
51228,"Here you are. Now make sure you give out every single one, we can't afford to let even one lost soul stray from Her warmth."
51229,"Goods and wares of all kinds, and all can be yours!"
51230,That's it. Keep hacking at it.
51231,"Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!"
51233,"This is what I've been trying to explain. It's in Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach."
51234,It's so good to see you again.
51235,"Besides, you're the one having all of these visions, aren't you?"
51236,That's it? That's all you've got?
51237,"Just my luck, stuck in the sticks with this crazy old woman."
51238,My father told me he found me as a young boy in the wreckage of a ship that sank off of the coast near Solitude.
51239,I hope whatever you're going to do will work.
51244,"If it's bed or board you're after, Candlehearth Hall's got both."
51248,I thought I was going to help you!
51249,"Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature."
51253,Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.
51255,"Home again, home again! I'll return to the Night Mother straightaway!"
51257,I was about to show him the error of his ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research notes.
51259,"Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the details."
51262,Just coat your weapon with it. Then... you get the idea.
51265,"She may be young, but Elisif is the Jarl by right. And here in Skyrim, if nothing else, we respect the traditions of our father's fathers."
51268,So many shadowy corners to strike from! I could learn to like this place.
51269,Had only Mara saved that poor animal...
51272,"Oh, yes. Goodbye, goodbye."
51277,"Oh my. Elgrim, it's on the shelf to the right of the table, as always."
51279,Interesting. I'll look it over. Thanks.
51281,"I owe you some answers, don't I?"
51283,Let me know if there's something you need to buy.
51285,"Alright, get the crown off that draugr!"
51287,Hmmm. Never read anything from the temple before. I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in reading it.
51289,Thank you. I'll share this with Aerin.
51290,"Just... leave me alone! I've brought your mead, now drink it and shut your filthy mouths."
51291,"Huh? Oh. Sure, whatever. I prefer Dibella's teachings myself."
51294,"Look, the only religion I believe in is the good old septim. Everything else is just a waste."
51295,"Whatever you're peddling, I'm not buying."
51298,Burn the king!
51300,Thanks for getting me out of that. Bashnag's coven chased me out and left me for dead down here. Nobody lasts too long with the spiders.
51301,To Oblivion with the rest of them - save yourself!
51302,"Shor's favor has found you, Dragonborn. The Hall of Valor, heart's-ease, awaits."
51303,Ralof? How do you know him?
51305,Now! Quickly!
51306,We are close now. Can you hear the Lexicon calling out?
51307,But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?
51308,"Well, sir, the hold of Falkreath is fairly vulnerable, and blocks the only road from Cyrodiil."
51309,"Of course. Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know."
51310,Of course. Take what you need.
51313,Then we're speakin' the same language. Good.
51314,"Walk in Gaius Maro's shadow, and deliver to him the judgment of Sithis."
51315,"Has the Bloodmoon called you, fellow Hunter?"
51316,"You're a stranger here too, eh?"
51317,You did? We heard that Ulfric was captured...
51318,Make it quick.
51320,Cross the river and then head north. You'll see Whiterun on its hill as you pass the falls.
51321,"Jarl Balgruuf still hasn't declared for one side or the other, so at least you won't run into any Imperials along the way."
51322,Go home and lock your doors.
51324,"Until then, let me offer you a warning. Beware the Forsworn. No place in the Reach is safe from us now."
51325,What are your thoughts on all this?
51326,"I'd like the fresh air better, but this isn't so bad."
51327,Regaining Pale Pass would help our supply situation considerably... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath...
51328,"Oh, splendid! Just splendid! Mara smiles upon us this day."
51331,The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.
51333,You did what?
51340,Inside the house. Now.
51341,Please. You're in the presence of a born huntsman. I can hear the sweat sliding down your forehead.
51342,"Stay out of trouble, Elf."
51344,"But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College."
51346,Rarely in my travels have I encountered those who possess skills equal to your own.
51347,The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.
51348,Hurry and get me out of this cage before they come for me!
51350,They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their experiments.
51354,Think carefully where your loyalties lie... brother.
51357,Agreed. To the death.
51358,"Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion."
51361,"By leaving Elisif alive, Ulfric completes the separation of the Empire and Skyrim. "
51364,What?
51366,"All right, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to come find you."
51367,We're with you.
51368,You think Alva...but that means...
51373,You beasts are the worst. 
51374,Many have died taking up arms for this cause. I fear that the land will be stained with blood for years to come.
51375,You've already lost!
51376,"Aye, the war keeps the Empire and the locals too busy to worry about us. Haldyn calls it ""our golden age."""
51377,Where'd you go?
51380,"Well, looks like you and I are going to have to get very well acquainted."
51382,I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.
51383,I'm disappointed in you brother. You had it all. You had it all and your mouth cost you everything.
51384,"Without birth there is no life, without death there is only stasis. Such is the truth of Arkay."
51385,"Since we're short on soldiers you'll be coming with us, too. No arguments."
51386,It means so much to us to have the claw back where it belongs. Thank you!
51387,"Tss! Get out of here, I saw nothing."
51388,We were told you may be coming.
51390,"Finally, someone around here that can get things done. "
51391,Good luck. Welcome to the Companions.
51393,This could be even more dangerous than I thought. Head to the ships. We'll plan the assault on the way.
51394,"We hurt them in the past, and they have long memories."
51395,You're pathetic!
51396,"You will be called on to take swift action. Rise to the challenge, and discover what you are capable of."
51399,"Well, here we are. We think."
51400,"The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood, Dragonborn."
51401,"Of course, I can't let you leave here alive. Wouldn't want anyone finding out."
51402,Can I get you something?
51403,"Greetings, sister Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home."
51405,It's a real pity about his wife and kid. The screams woke half the town.
51406,"Shutting this place down would dishonor my family's heritage, but what other choice will I have?"
51407,"...oh if I chance to see a cat, I'll feed its corpse to my pet rat... "
51409,"You mess with the Silver-Blood family, you end up here."
51410,Good luck out there.
51411,I also need to reassure Maven that it's business as usual without Mercer... and that a new Guild Master will soon be taking over.
51413,"Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting."
51414,What do you think we'll find in there?
51416,"Problem is, that place is locked up tighter than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about paranoia..."
51417,I have a letter here for you.
51418,You have my attention.
51419,I have an old cure for Rockjoint. Common in little Orc children.
51420,"I appreciate the delivery, here... I want you to have this. I insist."
51421,"Oh, right. That whole thing with the elves. Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?"
51423,"Quite the opposite, in fact."
51424,"Thank you, Vex. You've always been the most reliable one in the Guild."
51426,Hsssss!
51427,That doesn't begin to describe it.
51428,"I just don't know that it's right for us to be in here like this, picking through the ruins ."
51430,"I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge."
51431,"Like anyone would even notice, in all this mess."
51432,And I found a new deposit of amber. Would have been nice to have some help pulling it out. 
51433,Ooooh...yes...yes. You've fallen for my trap! Greed makes a great lure. Odd you didn't die from the fall though. Most do.
51434,"One way or another, get me those documents."
51435,"Perhaps... Perhaps it might. If nothing else, you could be an excellent sacrifice to Malacath."
51436,"If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding out on us and has more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find that information quite valuable as well."
51437,"Ah...Here it is. Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand still this will be much easier for me to do."
51438,Just walk toward the chest! Gravity will do the rest.
51440,"where welcome, well-earned, awaits those I judge fit to join that fellowship of honor."
51442,"I'm surprised you had the wits to notice, Olfrid, what with your nose buried so far up the Emperor's backside."
51444,"Yes, Grelod?"
51445,"We haven't had an adoption in months. At this rate, we'll be stuck with these brats forever. We need to get the word out. A sale, if need be."
51446,"The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us."
51447,"The stores are running low. We'll need to water down the milk again. Besides, don't want the little darlings getting fat."
51448,Nepos the Nose? He's been in Markarth forever. And he's well-respected among the natives of the Reach.
51449,What do you need?
51452,As you will.
51453,Mine's closed. Move along.
51454,"I can't abide Samuel's constant talk of his parents. ""They're coming for me."" ""This is only temporary."" The boy must accept his fate."
51455,Ah! Well done! Well done!
51457,"Samuel is getting to be a problem. Fancies himself something of a ""leader"" to the other children. Put an end to the nonsense, or I will."
51458,I'll handle it. No need to blow things out of proportion.
51459,What do you want? You have no business being in here.
51461,"To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy."
51464,"I have to see her. Please, excuse me."
51465,I'm going to see if I can find some way out of here.
51466,I value my privacy. So if you don't mind?
51467,Need a room? Or maybe just some mead?
51475,"Yes, I could use some help with that. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy."
51478,I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires advice.
51486,Now? You could use it for what we meant it for. Using black souls for enchanting.
51487,Next time think before you speak.
51491,"Cap'n Wayfinder's as green as seaweed, but he's learnin'."
51495,"Stick to the rules and you'll end up rich. Break them and you're out on your arse. Simple, right?"
51496,"We are fortunate. We travel lightly, and can escape at a moment's notice. We have no home that a dragon can burn to the ground."
51497,Too bad we can't read these carvings.  Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
51499,"Rustleif, I've been wondering. Maybe after the baby is born, we should move to Hammerfell."
51502,There are more books to be recovered and secured in the Arcanaeum.
51503,"The sooner you find the claw, the sooner our lives can get back to normal."
51506,I'm been farming this bit of land all my life.
51508,Of course! Any friend of Hadvar's is a friend of mine. I'm glad to help however I can.
51513,"I can't imagine what that might be, but if it's safe, you might see if they were successful."
51514,I was lucky to get children out of the ones I did.
51516,"What can't you get me, sweetie?"
51517,"Here's everythin' you need. You get caught, and we've never heard of you."
51518,"Don't worry about him. I know you work hard, and I'm the one who gets you your money."
51522,Remember. Ale is cheaper than blood in Markarth.
51524,"Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss."
51525,If I had one you could. They're all spoken for.
51526,Join the forces mustering at the [CAPITAL] (infos conditions on location go here)
51527,I can't wait here forever.
51529,The forge is hot today.
51534,You assist all you like. And get roasted for your trouble. I'll guard the exit.
51535,Think you can intimidate me? In my own orphanage? Ha! Not bloody likely.
51536,Show respect while you're here and you and I will be fine.
51537,"Please hurry. To be honest, I'm kind of lonely here. As much as I hated getting sent to Honorhall, I really miss my friends there..."
51538,Anything good in there?
51539,"Your corpse will feed my spiders for weeks. Now die, you fool!"
51541,"She got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just... she never got better. Not all year. One night she fell asleep and...  never woke up."
51545,I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Someone like Grelod doesn't deserve to live one more day. She's a monster.
51546,Is someone following me?
51547,Who's there?
51548,Ha! I knew it was you all along.
51549,"You may as well give up, I see you there."
51553,I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work.
51554,Must be my imagination.
51555,"If this keeps up, I'm headed back to the Winking Skeever."
51556,"Once you realize the Key can access these traits, the potential becomes limitless."
51557,Have you met my dear brother Erikur? The man's as trustworthy as a Khajiit goldmonger.
51558,"I swear, if I'm being followed..."
51560,"Tell him to finish the preparations, the Festival is back on."
51562,This city still reeks with the stench of the Stormcloaks. Makes me sick to my stomach.
51563,"Masterful. That's a work of art, right there."
51564,The Council will be informed of this. They will find out what you're up to.
51565,Not like this. Feels colder than usual. Bet it's those damned Mages.
51566,"I never would have believed it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes..."
51567,Yes. Hofgrir took me in when I arrived in Riften about a year ago. He's been teaching me everything he knows.
51568,I should have guessed Ulfric would be mixed up in this.
51569,"That would be Jarl Igmund. Young for a ruler of a Hold, especially the Reach. "
51570,Maven looked the other way as long as the honey kept flowing and we kept him in line.
51571,"If Sabjorn ever managed to push Maven off her pedestal, we'd all be in trouble."
51573,"Word on the street was that Honningbrew tasted better, cost less and Sabjorn didn't shove it down everyone's throat."
51574,Let's not kid ourselves. Black-Briar Mead is swill. The only thing keeping it successful is Maven.
51575,"Now, are you ready to try again? I am confident it will work this time."
51576,"Look, in case you hadn't noticed, these aren't the glory days of the Guild."
51580,Well? What word of the Emperor?
51581,You did? Thanks. I get you the rest of your coin by tomorrow.
51582,You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his attention.
51584,"I hope for all your sakes you find out who's behind this supposed ""plot."""
51585,"Now, mysteriously, some sort of anonymous adversary shows up and takes the Estate out of my hands."
51586,How are we supposed to feel safe in our own homes?
51587,I'll provide you wood and timber to make whatever riggings you'll need.
51588,"If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place."
51589,Having Goldenglow kept in line by the Thieves Guild has kept the honey flowing with minimal cost.
51590,You caught me! I surrender! Ha ha ha ha.
51593,Did you see the fires from Goldenglow Estate? I was afraid the whole place was going to burn to the ground!
51594,Oh my goodness!
51598,I take care of my friends.
51600,"Since I know losing the farm's payments will harm the Guild, I intend to make a substantial contribution for compensation."
51601,"It was you, wasn't it. I should of known better. Now look at me."
51602,"You're trying my patience, lad."
51603,"Well, I suppose we can't just stand here. We'd better do something."
51604,Must've scared 'em off.
51607,"We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation."
51609,"We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation."
51610,Why not let me run the Skeever? I already know lots about it!
51611,"Here, this should help."
51613,We must clear this confounding mist.
51614,We can shatter his power if we Shout together!
51618,"Again, together! Alduin is strong!"
51619,My father doesn't know anything about me. 
51623,Does his strength have no end? Is our struggle in vain?
51624,"Well, until they do, I don't have any business to discuss with outsiders."
51625,His power crumbles - do not pause for breath!
51626,"Ulfric can tell you more than most anyone. He was studying to be a Greybeard himself, back before the Great War."
51628,"Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you. "
51630,Mara has reflected an image to me. At the foot of the throat and young woman... almost a girl... her fickle love must resolve itself.
51631,"His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains."
51633,I can't deny the man is right about a few things...
51634,What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?
51635,"Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold."
51638,"We're used to getting by on scraps, but the Shatter-Shields want everything for nothing."
51641,"If anybody asks, this meeting never took place."
51643,Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!
51644,"Thanks for dealing with that orc. Something tells me that's not the last time we'll see him. And, something tells me that might not be a bad thing."
51646,Thanks for taking care of that. I don't think that will be the last we see of that Orc. It's always good to gain allies.
51647,"You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in there. We'll stay here and watch your back..."
51648,"Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me."
51654,"Ha! Remarkable! Well, the old bastard certainly made it worth your while, didn't he?"
51657,Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature is no different than my own.
51659,It's not that you're intruding. I'd wager they've actually expected us.
51660,"Do you ever want to go to Morrowind, Sondas?"
51662,Hunh!
51673,Some day Camilla will know of my affections. Some day...
51674,Right. And what did you say the point of this little venture was?
51675,Yessir!
51676,Get going.
51677,"I admit, I really didn't expect these talks to succeed. Getting the Empire to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement."
51680,The Prince of Plots usually gets what she wants. I'm surprised I'm not dead already. She must have had some reason to keep me alive so long.
51681,"Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me here."
51682,"Please, please let me out of here!"
51683,"I don't buy that story, either."
51688,I brought him the coin and walked away with her copy of the deed.
51689,I was approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for something big.
51691,Just getting jumpy I guess.
51694,"So far he's managed to stay out of the war. I'm afraid it can't last, though."
51695,"Hadvar, thank Talos! Your friend told me about Helgen..."
51697,"We make quite a team, eh?"
51698,Take down that one with your bare hands too?
51699,"I may be old, but I can put up a fight!"
51701,Urag has asked me to remind everyone to please return materials borrowed from the Arcanaeum in the same condition as you received them.
51703,I wonder how grandma Bothela is doing. She's probably worried sick about me.
51704,"In the Dark Brotherhood, I found acceptance, love, and my life's true purpose."
51705,"It became clear they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate power."
51706,Let's go!
51708,Yes?
51709,I'm counting on you.
51710,"Oh, by all means. Just leave your refuse wherever you see fit."
51712,"Now, if, um... you'll get going?"
51713,"Let's see. Ah, so that's what happened to Staubin. Tragic, but I warned him he was leading those people on a fool's errand."
51718,By Azura. The Gourmet!
51720,"But of course. You and I have a date with destiny. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?"
51721,Is it really dead?
51723,I thank you for your courtesy.
51726,"Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up."
51727,I know why you're here. I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
51729,"Oh, you can save your sinister bravado. I'll not go to my grave whimpering like an infant."
51730,Please! Help me!
51732,"You shouldn't leave weapons laying around. Someone could get hurt. And if I see you do it again, that someone will be you."
51733,"You and I have a date with destiny, it would seem. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?"
51734,"No, my wife. You have been given other gifts to please your chief than mine work. I will talk to Gharol and all will be well."
51735,"Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking."
51736,What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!
51737,"Greetings, brother."
51738,I do miss that helmet....
51739,"Please, our tribe suffers and we need help."
51743,"I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work."
51745,"If we can't get back into the mine, our town is sunk."
51746,"If you can get onboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as contracted... I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment."
51750,I suppose you should go to the docks and... swim?
51751,It's in the Solitude Inlet - that's the channel just north of the docks.
51752,I hope you have good news for Mirabelle.
51753,"Well, as a jailbreaker, you work alone. No Guild to back you up."
51754,"Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere."
51755,Surely you're joking?
51757,"The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others."
51758,Try not to die.
51759,You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume.
51760,"Living or dead, by decree of Shor, none may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test."
51762,"I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain."
51763,"I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain."
51764,"What? No. All right. I won't worry about the coin anymore, just stop giving me that look."
51767,Fool! Amateur! Without those papers you'll never be able to present yourself as the Gourmet! Off with you! Back to the body to retrieve them!
51769,My brother Roggvir wore a symbol of Talos. He kept it hidden on his person. If I had that...
51770,"You trespass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you."
51773,"Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand."
51775,"Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason."
51777,Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.
51778,"You're wrong to come here, stranger. No rest in Dawnstar."
51781,"My note? No, that's yours. Must have fallen out of your pocket."
51782,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
51783,"Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?"
51784,We've been looking for someone to join us in a hunt.
51785,"But first, inform Nazir of your plans. For you are the Listener, and must bind this Family together."
51787,To Oblivion with all of you! You rich piles of dung walking by us like we're not there! Pretending we don't exist! How dare you!
51788,I'll bend Kleppr's ear if there's anything wrong with a room you rent.
51789,"But while you live, the Dark Brotherhood lives. We must fulfill our contract. Emperor Titus Mede II must be eliminated."
51790,Astrid is dead. It is as it should be. May she find redemption in the Void.
51791,"Calm yourself, Galmar. Save it for the battlefield."
51792,"Maybe you've been listening to Erikur. There's been loose talk among some of the Thanes, and I suspect he's the cause of it."
51793,I would find the Dwemers' mechanical guardians fascinating if they didn't try to kill everything on sight.
51795,"You're such a wet blanket, captain. Can't a girl have a little fun from time to time?"
51796,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
51798,"I'm not sure. I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together."
51799,I like you Una. You've got presence.
51803,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
51805,That's some good armor you've put together.
51806,That's some good armor you've put together.
51808,"Where to start? Well, the news you heard about Ulfric was true. The Imperials ambushed us outside Darkwater Crossing."
51810,I'm sure we'll get our gold at some point. Not like he has anywhere to go.
51811,Bother someone else.
51812,"All right, Brand-Shei. Turn out your pockets, we know you have it."
51815,"We can do this one of two ways. You can walk with me up to the keep, or I can drag your lifeless body. Your choice."
51817,"Hold, comrades - let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined."
51818,"I'll take your challenge, but if I win I get to start a new life as an adventurer, and with no objections from you."
51820,The Twilight has foreseen all of this. Everything will be revealed in time.
51822,Thank you. I can't stand the thought of being trapped in this village for the rest of my days.
51823,I've been fighting in the Pit for years. That should tell you something.
51824,"No. Gods no, not for years."
51827,What's your wife think of your trips? 
51828,"Did you ask Mirabelle? She runs things around here, after all."
51829,Big shipment coming in later tonight. I need you three working late.
51832,"Alduin, his hunger insatiable, hunts the lost souls snared within this shadowed valley."
51834,"Shor's hall, shimmering across the clouded vale. But quenched was hope by the shrouding mist - my mind is darkened. "
51835,I'll tear you to pieces!
51838,"Ah... To be honest, no. But High King Torygg supported them, and now her lady Elisif has thrown in with them."
51839,"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
51841,This is all very strange. I've never seen anything like this.
51842,I think perhaps it might be best if you lead the way. My eyes aren't what they used to be.
51843,What is it? I said I didn't wish to... be disturbed.
51844,"As steward, I serve as an intermediary between the Jarl and her subjects."
51845,Loyal Nords are always welcome here. Anyone else better watch their step.
51848,"Blood and silver, friend. Blood and silver."
51849,"Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun."
51851,"That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim."
51852,"Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my name, that my influence may grow."
51854,"I'm not one for commendations, but I might've lost everything that matters. So... thanks."
51856,"Every blade I make honors Malacath. Every rivet, every plate of armor is for him."
51860,"I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my artifact, and destroy the defiler."
51861,"Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds."
51863,"But if you are wise, you will heed my bidding."
51864,Of course you will. I have commanded it!
51866,"Balimund pulled me out of Grelod's orphanage when I was just a child. I don't know what he saw in me, but I was glad to get out of there."
51869,I will send down a ray of light. Guide this light through my temple and its doors will open.
51871,"Malkoran has forced the doors shut. But this is my temple, and it responds to my decree."
51874,"I know her techniques, her skills. If she kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her."
51877,"I've only ever lost a few guards to Steam Centurions. Good odds, considering..."
51879,The defiler waxes! 
51880,"The College is the worst thing that's ever happened to Winterhold, maybe to Skyrim."
51881,"He will not resist the challenge of your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come."
51882,"Return to my figure on Mount Kilkreath, and I shall make you the instrument of my cleansing light."
51886,But it is not time for rejoicing. The defiler continues to profane my temple.
51887,You have found my beacon.
51890,"Excuse me. You misplaced this, I believe? There you go. Take care now."
51891,Two reasons. He's rich and because we need every sword we can get right now.
51893,Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark. 
51895,This is exactly what I'm talking about.
51900,"In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to market and a chunk of my profits with it!"
51902,Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.
51903,Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.
51904,"I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems."
51905,"I've battled next to every man and woman here, and the bonds of sweat are stronger than those of blood."
51906,"Maven Black-Briar's gone out of her way to try and have me shut down, but fortunately I have a good relationship with Whiterun's Jarl."
51907,I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.
51908,"We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother."
51909,No! Someone help me! Please!
51911,There you go. You may as well take Gunjar's gear. He won't be needing it any more.
51913,"Uh. Hey. That weapon there is just for show. Right? I mean, you aren't going to hurt me or anything... right?"
51914,"Here we are, found a key. Let's see if it opens that door."
51916,A word of advice -- don't buy discounted armor.
51918,"It's just... Well... you're an Orc! Ha ha ha! If the people of the Empire only knew! I mean, now I understand your need for secrecy. Most would..."
51920,I have little need for mindless thralls.
51922,"Dear brother. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated."
51923,"Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. Very successful business. Obviously."
51924,"See if you can't ""convince"" one of those innkeepers to help you."
51925,"Ooookay.... Um.... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two..."
51926,We have something of a vampire problem. Bodies have been found with blood drained. I know of a den nearby you can wipe out as a precaution.
51927,Let me see if I can find the right panel...
51928,Failure is not an option.
51929,"I can get you into one of those parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find Elenwen's secret files."
51930,But I don't want to be a sailor or a farmer. I want to be a warrior! The strongest one ever!
51931,You have earned the right to call yourself my Champion.
51932,"Ah, Camilla. Fair as the morning sun. But I ask you, how could she prefer your brooding to my romantic tunes?"
51933,No Empire is going to take the Jarlship away from this Son of Skyrim.
51934,"Yes, mother."
51936,That's it!
51941,"Very well. Here, take this for your troubles."
51945,On top of the Throat of the World is a patch of snow that's never melted.
51946,"Hey, over here!"
51947,You can take it over my dead body!
51949,My daughter died. Things won't be the same without her.
51951,I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me wrong. And I respect that.
51952,"Oh my. He was always so kind to me. A bit rough around the edges, but a good man. "
51955,Can you believe my former husband used to give most of our gold to the poor?
51957,The courier must have found you.
51958,"All right, I'll entertain you a bit more. Go on."
51961,And now you must perform the task for which I created you. You have already proven to possess the needed skills.
51962,I... I'm not one for talk. Try to keep to myself.
51965,Fent ni filok.
51966,"This is far as I can take you. Krif voth ahkrin. I will look for your return, or Alduin's."
51968,I don't suppose you could come back another time? I'm very busy.
51969,"Free me, and I will carry you to Skuldafn."
51970,Onikaan koraav gein miraad. It is wise to recognize when you only have one choice.
51971,"Zok brit uth! I warn you, once you've flown the skies of Keizaal, your envy of the dov will only increase."
51973,"Another Overseer will replace Orchendor, when the time comes. For now all is cleansed and ordered."
51975,It will be done.
51976,That's just what Ulfric wants you to think.
51977,Just what I was afraid of!
51980,"Now, you. Get down there."
51982,But I had to know if the rumors about you were true...
51983,"Out. She owns the place, she does what she wants."
51984,Mercer doesn't need to die... he needs to feel the cold sting of fate as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.
51987,Riften denies the Emperor. You are here illegally. Stand down and you will be arrested and tried in the morning. Resist and you will die.
51988,"I'm just glad we had this, now. I was almost getting ready to eat my servant and blame it on the Forsworn."
51990,"It's not my place to get involved in their family's business, remember? You're the one that told me to stay out of it."
51991,"Here. It isn't much, but... I hope it's the thought that counts."
51993,"I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with selling it."
51996,"I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I won't hesitate."
51998,"Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok. Nothing is certain with such things..."
51999,"He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone respected him and followed him without question."
52002,"Ah, Falion. Always looking where he shouldn't for things he doesn't need."
52010,Onmund's amulet in exchange for my staff.
52011,She influences our luck and in return demands payment.
52013,Are your ears still ringing? I hope that goes away.
52014,The only difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense and sometimes the cost can be quite high.
52016,You're closer to understanding than you realize.
52022,Well why don't you be quick about finding my book that you lost?
52026,"Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well."
52031,Do you wish to test yourself against me?
52032,Looks like we're the only ones who made it. Was that really a dragon? The bringers of the End Times?
52033,"A well placed word, or a well placed dagger. Both can achieve equal purposes."
52036,I cast shadows across your grave!
52037,"Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes."
52039,I'll tear you apart!
52041,What are you doing in here?
52045,The wedding is soon. It'll be a good day.
52046,"Well, offer still stands if you ever want to have a go."
52047,"Judging by your armor, I'd say you're an Imperial scout. If so, well met."
52048,You are nothing.
52049,"Why so glum, my ugly friend? Did we run out of mead?"
52052,"And so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage. Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new Age."
52055,"Sorry, lass... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time."
52057,"If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us."
52058,"Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you."
52060,"If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do."
52064,Our Lord! She has come!
52065,(Gasps)
52068,These boys do good work for the Empire!
52069,I should slay you for such insolence!
52070,My good pleasure is not some trophy for mortal sport!
52071,My favor?
52073,"A lifetime of study, you might say. The best comes from Riften, but I haven't been there in years."
52076,"Ulfric is our rightful High King. He's leading the fight to drive the Empire out of Skyrim, once and for all."
52077,"The College has developed some theories, however."
52078,(Deep breath)
52080,"Ancano. He's in there, doing... something. We don't know what. We're trying to get in now."
52081,"But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure you."
52082,Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going on.
52087,Ancano! Stop this at once! I command you!
52088,I suppose you want your share now? Here you go.
52089,I'll never understand why you're so bitter about everything.
52090,Don't go near him!
52091,"I need you to find the Arch-Mage, and I need you to do it quickly. Get moving!"
52093,There is always work for the Companions. But there is more personal task before me.
52094,I want to get to my son. He's all I have left.
52099,"Unless you intend to bury someone this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler."
52100,The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.
52101,"You hungry? There's plenty of food. Eat up, now."
52102,"There are others who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and often in secret."
52103,For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.
52104,Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.
52106,I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.
52108,Dengeir was a good Jarl in his day.  Even if his day has passed.
52110,Can't say that I have.
52112,There's two things to do at the Flagon: spend coin and then get out.
52113,"That'd be the College in Winterhold. I suppose you'll be headed there, then. Well, don't let me get in your way."
52117,Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.
52118,Will she acknowledge that it is we Nord's who will determine Skyrim's future? 
52121,"I can fashion whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here before you."
52123,"The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies."
52124,Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.
52126,Be mindful.  My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to Siddgeir.
52127,"I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid."
52128,"I'm sorry, I should really go now."
52129,"No, I don't think that will be necessary."
52130,"From maid to Steward, I can hardly believe it. I hope I'm up to the task."
52131,I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.
52132,Boo! Ahahahaha!
52133,Anything I can get you?
52134,"Look, I talked to the Jarl, the Steward, the Housecarl... everyone. They all told me their resources were spread too thin right now."
52135,"What do you need, stranger?"
52136,Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.
52137,Can I get you something?
52138,You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.
52139,That Valga Vinicia is a gossip and a troublemaker.
52140,"Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another."
52141,"Khajiit is just a guard, and has no wares to sell."
52142, 
52144,Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.
52145,How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?
52146,Malthyr told me that you've been speaking to Ulfric about our situation. He said you're going to help us.
52148,This war isn't needed. Imperials like my wife can be hard to handle but we Nords could work with them. I should know.  
52150,"My wife, Indara, has a gift with animals.  It makes her a better farmer than anyone I've ever seen."
52151,"Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away."
52152,I swear they're making me do this for a laugh. At least I'm not dealing with the prisoners down below.
52153,Indara and I like to keep to ourselves and run our farm. 
52154,"Make up your mind, will you? You're starting to make us look bad."
52155,"Yes, but... not so loud!"
52156,"Hey, wood elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!"
52157,My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.
52159,Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.
52160,"Wh- no... I.... Oh, by the Eight, fine. But only to the edge of town!"
52161,"Unless you intend to bury someone, this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler."
52162,No one escapes. I thought keeping Madanach down there would keep him under control.
52163,"Help the Dark Elves? Oh, you must have heard me talking to Malthyr."
52164,"Hello there, friend. How lucky for you to chance upon a bard on the road."
52165,Cough
52166,"Bah. If it were up to me, we'd cut off your hands and never let you back in this Sanctuary. But no. All you have to do is pay Nazir a fine. Pathetic."
52167,"Perhaps you have encountered Ma'dran or Akhari? Both are sworn to me, and both have worthy goods to offer."
52168,I'm glad we're friends. I have something for you. Here.
52169,He lives in seclusion on the very peak of the mountain.
52170,Are you married? You look the type. Make sure you treat your wife with the respect she deserves.
52171,"Be mindful. My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to that pompous nephew of mine, Siddgeir."
52172,"Well, suffice to say she is resplendent, but not without resolve. Striking, in all senses."
52173,Anything I can get you?
52174,"I've half a mind to ask if you'll take me on one of your adventures, but I can't just leave Valga on her own."
52175,"And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught!"
52177,"I'm a bard, from the Bards College here in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying."
52179,You should come hear me play at the Sleeping Giant Inn. For a small sum you can even pick the song.
52180,Looking for something?
52184,You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.
52185,"Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the ""great warriors""? "
52186,You better quiet down before you end up there. Then I'd have to work the forge.
52187,"Stay out of my way, boot."
52188,That he... that I'm...  that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister.
52190,"Be careful, Mjoll. The Thieves Guild has Maven Black-Briar at her back."
52191,"I'm just here to protect the Jarl, not to chat."
52192,The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.
52194,Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.
52195,Who has a sister?
52197,"You, go pack your things."
52199,"If you bring it to me, I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At least, not for you."
52203,"I don't know if the war is Arkay's will or man's, but it's none of my doings."
52204,This war isn't needed. Imperials like my wife can be hard to handle but we Nords could work with them. I should know.  
52205,"My wife, Indara, has a gift with animals.  It makes her a better farmer than anyone I've ever seen."
52206,Indara and I like to keep to ourselves and run our farm. 
52207,"Here, take this - it's called Jarrin Root."
52208,Honest pay for honest work.
52209,You have the look of a killer.
52210,You've taken up enough of my time. Now leave.
52211,When you broke up the binding Potema escaped. We've encountered some of her minions.
52212,"Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun."""
52217,Have you always been that ugly?
52219,Take extra care you don't hit your head on a low-hanging bit of stone.
52220,Alive.... You're alive... Thank Sithis... 
52221,I'm warning you. Those people are killers. You'd never last a day with them.
52222,I'll have to make a point of re-reading it. I don't recall the details.
52224,Ahhh. Quite fine my friend. Quite fine.
52225,Free...again.
52226,"Yes. I set you up. I wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother, and everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me."
52229,The way you and your mother forge weapons is impressive.
52231,"I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike."
52234,"But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this. "
52235,No! Don't pity me. I deserve whatever fate the Dread Lord has in store. I betrayed you... and now Maro has betrayed me. Fitting...
52236,Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
52237,"But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this."
52240,You must kill...
52242,You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest knowings.
52243,Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.
52244,Laas!
52246,Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.
52248,"Sure, leave. Everyone else does."
52250,You want to fight? That why you have your weapon out?
52251,I heard you attacked someone in town recently.
52252,"We Nords are strong, and we're as tough as stone. But I'll bet you didn't know there's some of us with a good head for business, too."
52253,Those fools are actually fighting!
52254,"It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!"
52257,The only thing I dislike about my husband's homeland is the cold. Why is it always so cold?
52258,Not now.
52260,Fine. Leave me the elf. You may go with your books.
52261,An arrangement? After you've destroyed so much?
52264,Farewell.
52265,"With a wife like Fridrika and a son like Horm, I'm the luckiest man in Skyrim."
52266,"Oh dear, I didn't mean to say she isn't bright."
52267,"""When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world"""
52270,"You little wretch, I saw that!"
52272,We are used to the cycle of gain and loss. It is no trouble.
52274,"Gerdur, I'm fine. At least now I am."
52275,And who's this? One of your comrades?
52276,"Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe her my life, in fact."
52277,You're right. Follow me.
52278,Works for me. Tell Octieve the debt's settled.
52281,"Please, I don't have anything to pay you with! Don't destroy my urn!"
52283,"I'm sorry to drag you into Markarth's problems, but after that attack in the market, I'm running out of time."
52284,But... we had a deal...
52285,Thank you.
52287,I lost my twin sister a while back. Have you ever lost anyone close?
52288,"Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the northwest side of the island."
52289,Aav dilon!
52290,"Well, thank you for bringing it I suppose. Have a good day."
52292,My job is my life. Whatever happened before doesn't matter.
52294,I provide my wisdom and insight to the court.
52295,Sovngarde saraan!
52297,Qiilaan us dilon!
52298,"By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee."
52300,"Bolog aaz, mal lir!"
52303,You've got that right. Only a matter of time before we're roasted alive. Come on!
52304, 
52306,Don't you see? I am master of the arcane!
52307, 
52308,Ah yes. I remember your name from the guest list.
52311,"Ah, there's nothing like fresh air and honest labor to bolster the spirit."
52313,"Yes, Madame Ambassador."
52314,"I'm sure Pavo would be grateful, and we'd all rest a little easier."
52315,"Please, tell me more about yourself. What brings you to this... to Skyrim?"
52318, 
52320,"Ah, wonderful, wonderful! Why waste all that hatred on yourself when it can so easily be directed at others!"
52322,"When Mercer stole the Key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our ties to her."
52325,"Don't worry, I'm mad at her, too. And at myself for ever agreeing to get involved in her insane scheme."
52326,Shirking the law in Windhelm ain't what it used to be. Not with the Thieves Guild running things...
52327,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
52330,"The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow. "
52333,Don't start any trouble and I think we'll get along just fine.
52334,"Okay? The deal was already done, the thing just never showed up. I can't help that!"
52335,"But by Sithis, I hope I'm making the right choice here. You may be an effective killer, but your command of guile leaves much to be desired."
52338,I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
52339,"I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere, that is."
52340,"No! Linwe prefers stealing from the deceased. Digs up the corpses, breaks into the Hall of the Dead..."
52344,Did he warn you that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?
52348,I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
52350,"I trust you're not planning any trouble. What can I do for you, friend?"
52354,"When we're done rooting out Imperial influence here at home, then we will take our war to the Aldmeri Dominion."
52355,Perhaps a silver necklace or a silver ring? Easy to wear and soft against the skin.
52357,May Kynareth guard you while you pass through her realm!
52360,"Well that much is good. Let's finish this first war before starting the next one, eh?"
52361,Why struggle? The Thalmor will only send more like me.
52364,You'll have a traitor's death.
52365,A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training.
52367,This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals. You should be cautious.
52369,"When I finally became a priest, they gave me the new high priest's dagger, but I already owned my father's."
52371,"I had to for honor's sake, but I had waited too long. My father died before he could see my training to completion."
52373,What future?
52375,You dare invade my home?
52376,This is my realm. I won't let you take it from me!
52377,How could they live like this? It's disgusting.
52378,"... no, sorry, but in times like these I can't just take the word of a stranger who wanders into town claiming to be my brother's friend."
52380,"What's your sign? I was born under the Steed, as luck would have it. Really ought to visit my doomstone somtime. It's fairly near here."
52382,"While you were in the Star, Azura gave me a vision. Her last, she said."
52386,"I will tend Azura's shrine when you do not need me. I still have my duties, but for the first time I feel... alone."
52387,Ha ha ha ha ha! Hooray!
52389,I can do this all day!
52391,We must return to the Sanctuary! Your Family is in dire peril!
52393,Only a couple more.
52394,Oh... Well... yes. I did. I did indeed. I tried to listen. Tried so hard. But the Night Mother never spoke to poor Cicero.
52397,Ayarg garag gar!
52399,Ayarg garag gar!
52401,Ayarg garag gar!
52402,We can't thank you enough for helping us get this office running.
52404,I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
52406,"Hmm. Well now. This is all very fascinating, but I don't recall asking to you to touch anything in here."
52407, 
52411,I return from the war to find my home overrun with bandit filth.
52412,Leave or be removed.
52413,"By weaving the darkness to their will, this agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time."
52414,"Talos guide you, lass."
52415,The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgement of those around him.
52417,Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!
52419,We will soon begin publicly executing captured men. That should send a clear message to the people.
52420,"If you get me the logbook, I'll have proof of Shatter-Shield's treachery."
52421,Choose your path and your journey will be complete.
52422,"Anything, anything at all would be a start. Then we can figure out how to get to him."
52424,"Okay, let's all take a deep breath. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Please tell me this is some kind of sick joke."
52426,You look like you've just seen a ghost. Please tell me you haven't. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother... but she spoke to you?
52427,"You keep on like you are, you'll end up with two daughters who hate you."
52428,We can just sacrifice another disciple. Apprentice Haerlon will be no great waste.
52429,What in Arkay's name was that?
52430,That's a dwarven city. I hear they built armor that walks like people.
52433,You had best take advantage of this truce while it lasts.
52435,"Is that a dwarven city? I've never seen a dwarf, ever. Don't think anyone has."
52436,Hun!
52438,By the gods! What are you doing here?
52439,Huh. Dwarven ruins. Strange places.
52440,I dislike lurking near dwarven cities. It's like their ghosts are watching us.
52441,"Wait, so... a costume? You're not serious..."
52442,Dwarven metalwork. So much wasted effort.
52443,"Nothing, Ragnar. Please... don't hurt me."
52444,"Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then."
52448,Nord stonework. Thousands of years old.
52450,It seems there's this strange button on the wall opposite the fireplace in my house. Always wondered what it was for.
52452,But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the Blades. Someday.
52454,I have something I want to give to you. Here.
52457,"There's a cave. Animals or bandits inside, no doubt."
52459,We've found a cave. I don't think there are warm fires and friendly faces inside.
52460,Sure.
52461,What could drive a man to do something like this?
52463,There's a cave. Tread carefully.
52466,"Look at that, a cave. Who knows what could be down there?"
52468,"Finally, you're back."
52469,"Look, a cave. An exciting place to venture, if you know what you're doing."
52470,Aye.
52471,A little closer.
52473,There's a cave here. Perfect hideout for bandits or worse.
52474,I don't want you to leave Ivarstead.
52475,Very well. I'll send a request for additional Legionnaires to protect trade to the other Imperial holds. Hopefully Solitude can spare more men.
52477,"Gotta admit, that's impressive."
52478,"You go report our success. I'll set up a garrison here. A shame none of the prisoners made it, but their names will be remembered."
52482,"I do apologize, Listener, but Nazir made it clear the initiates are not to speak with you until you first deal with him, and atone for your actions."
52483,Yeah!
52484,Follow me.
52485,"Somewhere in the ice fields, if you want to try to find him. "
52487,"I am the one cursed by Malacath. It is my burden. I bear it, and continue to lead, and the others see how strong I am. That is how I rule."
52490,Wow! That's impressive.
52493,I also would like to get a handle on what the rebels are planning - slip into their headquarters and steal their war plans.
52494,"Until then, I train. My new home will need strength, and my new sisters must know I am not weak when I arrive."
52495,"Hind siiv Alduin, hmm? No doubt you want to know where to find Alduin?"
52498,I have a feeling there's going to be trouble.
52499,You'll have to fight me for it.
52501,Is there a reason you're asking me?
52504,Very well.
52506,Here you go... should fit you like a glove... boss.
52509,Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire island.
52510,"Face it, cow! Your stupid son is dead! He died a Stormcloak traitor. And you... you best keep your mouth shut before you suffer the same."
52511,I don't like it. What are they waiting for?
52512,"Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business."
52513,It's just business.
52514,"And of course the symbol for ""Dragonborn."" That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing downward at the bottom."
52515,"The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours."
52518,"You're losing this war, and you know it."
52519,You... you disappointed me. You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.
52521,"At present, these two groups do little beyond attempting to gain the attention and favor of the Emperor."
52522,"No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it."
52523,Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what Beirand always tells me.
52526,I'm sure that will be comforting to your comrades that gave their lives for the territory you just handed to Ulfric.
52529,You are hereby dishonorably dismissed and removed from the rolls of the Imperial Legion.
52531,"Sorry, all out of coin."
52532,No turning back now.
52533,"Once again, you have underestimated me. You see the man, brutish and hulking. But I am wolf as well. Deliberate. Cunning."
52536,"Well. I can see your father and I are going to have to talk about this. And when we do, things are going to change."
52538,"This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And Jarl Ulfric. Markarth is ours!"
52540,"Now you, lass... You've got some beautiful trunks yourself... Hmm?"
52542,"By Talos, that's an excellent question. I hope you haven't forgotten that little detail?"
52546,Interesting problem. Hmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here in Sky Haven Temple.
52550,Bet I can down this ale faster than you!
52551,"I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true son of Skyrim here today."
52556,I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.
52557,Those invested in Restoration magic find Healing Hands to be essential. Can you cast it on me? That would prove your skill.
52558,Okay. Stand very still. This might sting.
52559,"Even if you're one of us, you better not make trouble."
52560,"On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby."
52561,Get moving.
52563,You're not supposed to be in here.
52564,And we'll need to hand the city over to that Free-Winter fellow.
52566,"Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him."
52567,"Yes. For Sithis... and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time."
52570,"Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde."
52571,Well? Get out of here and mind your rounds.
52574,"All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead."
52577,Thanks for the help. The Reach has been crawling with Forsworn lately. 
52578,Gianna will be overjoyed to meet you. She's in the kitchens.
52581,Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.
52585,"Now, I'm a busy man and your pointless questions are boring me terribly. Good day. "
52587,"I... I'm sorry! I didn't realize! We... we had no idea who to expect, you understand. You're not dressed as I would have suspected..."
52588,By Azura. The Gourmet!
52590,"Oh! No, I didn't mean it that way. Elgrim can barely put his on his own shoes let alone have the energy to pursue a young girl."
52591,"Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist."
52592,What's this now?
52593,She's a girl. She cried. 
52595,Ready to practice some more?
52597,I... I'm sorry! Your clothes... of course... I should have realized!  
52598,But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
52599,What's this now?
52602,"Are you a hunter, by chance? The hills surrounding the village are ripe with game."
52604,"Hmmm, the Potage le Magnifique. Smells delicious."
52605,Really? Now that is interesting...
52607,"Just go right into the tower, then straight ahead to the kitchen. Gianna's expecting you."
52608,"What? I'm not even... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the alchemical art."
52609,"Half of the businesses in town owe me money, and I own most of the rest. I practically run Solitude already."
52611,"Keep it together, Gianna. Keep it together..."
52615,"Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it."
52617,Eirid's a little girl who doesn't understand that they're responsible for destroying our home.
52618,"You didn't have to help me, so... thanks."
52619,Don't take too long figuring it out. Might mistake your hesitation for Imperial sympathies.
52624,You're a High Elf! I... I never would have guessed it. So many of your recipes are clearly aimed at the commonfolk. It just seems...
52627,"I... Well, I just can't believe the Gourmet is a Dark Elf. How difficult it must have been for you in Morrowind. The food there is..."
52628,"Oh. Well, um, actually... you're not. Wearing a chef's hat, I mean. There's one right over there on the shelf. You can't very well cook without it..."
52631,Any luck gathering those ingredients?
52632,"Come, at the very least walk out with me."
52634,I guess Lucan will never see the golden claw again now.
52635,"How about you get me a shiv? Not that I need one, but it's nice to have in case I need to do some ""shaving."" Ha ha."
52640,"Maybe we should start over, hmm? We want the Gourmet's famous Potage le Magnifique to be perfect, after all."
52644,"But I honor your courage. Krif voth ahkrin. Die now, in vain."
52648,Look around here. There's not much left.
52649,"Yes, my friend? How may I help?"
52651,"Ah, of course. I suspected as much."
52652,At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.
52655,A... giant's toe? You're... sure about that?
52656,"Stay back, lord!"
52659,Okay. Now what?
52661,"Yes, yes. We should proceed cautiously."
52662,Wait!
52663,But it must be something you're doing. There's no other explanation...
52664,What brings you to me? Find some strange creature in your travels?
52665,"Well, I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?"
52668,"What, um... What next?"
52669,Of course! I.... I'm sorry. One giant's toe. There.
52671,Always a pleasure. What brings you back?
52673,"Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might..."
52674,"Well, if you change your mind, you know what to do."
52677,For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.
52678,No need to get snippy.
52680,"All right then, your secret ingredient's been added."
52681,Really? All right! You pick. Tag or hide-and-seek?
52682,"Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes."
52683,"There's no resting your hide in a cell in this prison. Here, you work. You'll mine ore until you start throwing up silver bars."
52686,So be it. The sons of Skyrim at least put the greater good above our own interests.
52687,Bah! This is a waste of time. I can see that we won't get better terms from this council.
52688,You'd do well to remember that.
52689,Nothing.
52690,You can't tell them!
52691,"Yes, brother. I'm sure they'll agree it's a fair price to pay in order to avoid interacting with you on a daily basis."
52693,"You're the assassin, right? Look, there's this Reckless Mage in the Frozen Hearth Inn, in Winterhold. I want him dead. This gold should cover it. "
52694,We want compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
52695,"Well, aren't you the pretty one. I bet all the men chase after you."
52696,We want compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
52698,We want compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
52699,"I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you helping the Jarl, Solitude would be weaker."
52700,"Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!"
52701,We want compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
52702,We want compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
52703,We want compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
52706,We want compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
52707,We want compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
52711,"Look, I'm only telling you this because I care for her. Don't mistake this as acceptance for what you do."
52712,"The Skyforge? Aye, my clan-fathers have worked it since the first Gray-Manes came to Whiterun."
52713,"If we're not going to get Markarth, we need you to give us something."
52716,"There's a small skeever den just east of the city, at Reachwater Rock."
52718,"So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards by using this council to advance your own position?"
52720,"Yes. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning."
52721,Spoken like a true son of Skyrim!
52722,"Oh my... umm, you won't let Mercer hear about this will you? Ahem."
52724,I hope the wind dies down a bit before tonight. Hard when you've got to sleep outside. 
52725,"I've got it right here. Just don't read it, it's not very good."
52726,Meet me at the Solitude stables after you've arranged things with Malborn. Any questions?
52727,"Officially, nothing."
52728,Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay. Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
52732,"When I'm in Whiterun, I always visit the Gildergreen. Never hurts to pay your respects to Lady Kynareth, particularly in my line of work."
52734,Jarl Ulfric...
52735,I used to wander the corners of Skyrim like you. I miss those days.
52736,I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering.
52738,Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.
52740,"The Empire can live with these terms, yes. For a temporary truce, until the dragon menace is dealt with."
52741,"It wasn't enough that the College still stands, now the damnable Empire has Winterhold. I hope they all freeze to death."
52745,The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now. So... which ingredient should I add next?
52746,"I shouldn't agree to terms that so blatantly favor the Empire. I have no choice, though, under the circumstances."
52747,"What do you think this is? We don't do battle with magic around here, new blood. Now come at me."
52751,Sovngarde awaits you!
52752,"Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Such a shame..."
52754,"You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark."
52755,The Pale will be turned over to the Empire. Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship in Dawnstar.
52756,Let me guess - Astrid failed to mention I'm her husband? She has a tendency to do that. Doesn't want the others thinking she plays favorites.
52757,"The Stormcloaks will withdraw from Hjaalmarch, and Idgrod Ravencrone will resume the Jarlship."
52760,"Hjaalmarch will be turned over to Ulfric, with Sorli the Builder assuming the Jarlship."
52761,"The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Rift, allowing the return of Jarl Laila Law-Giver."
52763,"Jarl Igmund will go into exile, with Thongvor Silver-Blood taking his place as Jarl of Markarth."
52764,"The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Reach, allowing Ulfric's forces unhindered access to Markarth."
52765,"Sorry, outlander, but this old Orc cannot help you. Burguk is the chief here."
52767,"Um... thank you, Lash. You'd... make a fine Nord?"
52771,"The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Hjaalmarch. Idgrod Ravencrone will go into exile, with Sorli the Builder replacing her as Jarl."
52772,The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne.
52773,We control every piece of this city. The people should be calling us kings.
52775,Thanks a lot!
52777,"Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Falkreath, allowing Jarl Siddgeir to return."
52778,"I'm just no good at this. You said it yourself. Gods, I don't even like horses. And if it's true what they're saying about dragons..."
52779,Typical outlander weakling. But your gold will strengthen our clan.
52780,"Stay out of trouble, Argonian."
52781,"To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate."
52782,These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.
52785,Don't blame you one bit.
52788,"You always were a fool, Ulfric. You'll never get a better chance to salvage something from the ruins of your ambition."
52791,Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty disagreements?
52792,Here you sit arguing about... nothing! While the fate of the land hangs in the balance!
52794,"And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say, before you do anything rash."
52796,What makes you so sure? What if I'm right?
52797,Your words are cheap. Why should I speak to you after what you've done?
52798,Can you not put aside your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger?
52799,You're correct.
52800,"A very pretty speech, but what does it have to do with..."
52801,"If he's right about Alduin... we both have just as much to lose here, Tullius, remember that."
52802,"May Arkay bless you with a long life, a proud death, and a restful grave."
52803,All I care about is two things: watchin' Maven's back and countin' the gold she pays me to do it.
52804,"Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis."
52805,"We re-founded the Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance between us and our Bosmer cousins. You might know them from their common name. Wood elves."
52808,"I think you're on the wrong side in this war, my friend."
52809,"The Eye of Magnus. Here, but lost. Slipped through our grasp. Oh, what we might have learned."
52810,You here for lessons like Ingun? Or did you wish to buy something?
52811,It's where men have tested their mettle for ages.
52813,"You don't really expect compensation every time a farm gets burned in a war that you started, do you Ulfric?"
52814,I don't know why I expected even-handed treatment from you.
52815,The days of staying within Largashbur's walls are over.
52816,Sleep well?
52817,What?
52818,"Heh. Chamber fit for a king and all that, right? No problem. Give ya a big bed, decorate the room real nice, maybe even throw in a few extra baubles."
52819,"In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly."
52823,Ha! You can never truly stop me!
52825,"We all wait upon you, Dragonborn."
52827,If you prefer I took my men and left...
52828,"So, Dragonborn. What do you say?"
52829,"Yeah? Well, I got news for you; there's nothing to see here."
52831,"Let's go, Galmar. I should have listened to you in the first place."
52833,I return to the shadows...
52834,"You did the best you could, sister. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point."
52835,Felldir! We agreed not to use it!
52836,"I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course."
52837,All the apiaries... it will take years to get those bees happy again. 
52838,"You heard what she said, Ulfric."
52839,"You heard the man, Ulfric."
52840,The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.
52841, 
52843,"If you think we'll just hand over Riften, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor."
52845,"If you think this war is nearly won, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor."
52847,"I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You treated us fairly despite your known rebel sympathies."
52848,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
52849,"I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad situation."
52851,I can pay you.
52852,"Go, boys! Attack!"
52859,"Look at it. That's real Nord craftsmanship, that is! Let me show you an old trick I learned as a scout. Makes it harder for the enemy to notice you."
52861,General Tullius.
52866,For Dawnstar!
52869,"Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him."
52870,This council is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request.
52872,"Now that that's settled, may we proceed?"
52873,You've dealt with us fairly so far. You've heard our demand. What say you?
52874,An impertinent question. The elf must die. Either carry out my will or do not. You are not the only mortal agent I could choose.
52875,That looks like the way out! I knew we'd make it!
52877,"What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"
52879,"Are you out of your mind? We said no bloodshed! Well, guess what. You can just forget about your gold."
52881,I've never liked having the rebels right on Solitude's doorstep. Retaking Hjaalmarch would help secure our supply lines...
52882,Avanchnzel. Take it to Avanchnzel. You must take it back.
52883,"Fair enough. You claim to be neutral, but it seems that you actually favor the Empire. Still..."
52887,Fair enough. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
52889,Need something?
52892,"Not enough to outweigh the loss of Markarth. With the Reach in enemy hands, our whole position in Solitude would be threatened."
52893,I was afraid you were going to say that.
52898,"You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can."
52901,"Not ready? Well, my arrogant little sibling, until you pay the fine the Dark Brotherhood holds nothing for you. No contracts. No rewards. No respect."
52906,"Secondly, we got more of 'em hiding in a village, using the local populace as shields. Not to worry. We can dispatch them without harming the locals."
52911,You still wish something of me?
52913,"Ask Esbern. If he doesn't know himself, he'll know where to find it out."
52914,"If I wanted to get yelled at, I'd be home. Can't you leave me be?"
52917,I'll teach you to talk to me that way!
52918,You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions leader. 
52922,"This doesn't concern you, ""citizen."" "
52923,Because... I would miss you.
52924,Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and sisters.
52925,"I found you! Na na na, na na na!"
52926,"I'm grateful, Skaggi. I'm sorry my daughter gives you so much trouble."
52930,Shhh!
52931,He he he.
52932,Congratulations on your wedding. I'm so happy for both of you.
52933,My cousin died. Things won't be the same without her.
52935,Argh! You found me!
52937,"The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. Go and take care of it."
52938,"Ain't sure if they're takin' on new members, but you should talk to the Companions. They're over in their hall, Jorrvaskr."
52942,A blade! It will be as sharp as Fralia's tongue!
52943,"If he knew that I'd keep him from hunting the poor boy down, he'd take Fastred to Riften without a second thought."
52946,Just like Ysgramor himself. 
52947,"Even so, we've got to find Esbern before they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does."
52948,A rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my strength and my wealth is my weapon.
52951,You should talk to Rustleif. Get some proper steel.
52952,You... must be Dragonborn!
52953,"Good to have some fresh eyes up there at the top. I follow your lead, Harbinger."
52954,It is my hope that I will one day return to Hjaalmarch. But the Divines have not shown this to me.
52955,Get her!
52956,"Yes, I suppose there is."
52957,M'aiq knows why Falmer are blind. It has nothing to do with the Dwemer disappearing. Really.
52960,I'm going to put those pelts you gave me to good use.
52961,We can't trust anyone! Who knows what they'll do if they find me here.
52962,Stars? You wouldn't be referring to that incident a few years ago? I still say that exile was far too harsh.
52963,"The only thing I remember is the old story of Tiber Septim being called Dragonborn by the Nords, before they switched sides and joined the Empire."
52967,Just round up the rest of the magical artifacts so that I can catalog them.
52969,"Come on now, you're a sharp one. You must have heard of werewolves before."
52970,"This house of yours is wondrous, at least to these eyes. I've thought about starting a store. Something to do here when you're out."
52971,"I didn't want to, but she attacked to try and keep me from leaving."
52977,What?
52979,Really should talk to Mulush if you have a problem with one of the workers.
52981,"Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here."
52982,Nord nonsense?! Why you puffed-up ignorant... these are our sacred traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire!
52983,What's he doing poking his nose in there?
52984,"A hard truth, that is. Let's drink to the fallen ones."
52987,I can't believe I've finally made it here.
52988,"Make it quick, but make it hurt. If you get caught by the guards, I don't know you."
52990,Don't hurt me!
52991,I'll get everything ready and meet you there.
52993,Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor!
52994,I've fought worse than you!
52995,Now move quickly. The girl must be brought to the temple as soon as possible.
53000,We don't get many people like you visiting Winterhold. Usually it's elves.
53004,No. We'll stay. Out of respect for the Dragonborn and our Greybeard hosts.
53007,"You're the one who's coming to Japhet's Folly with us, right? You ready to go?"
53010,That's what I keep telling myself.
53012,Excellent work!
53013,One person's trash is another's treasure. Don't be surprised if you find that gone...
53014,We've taken it before. I'm only asking for what will be ours soon enough anyway.
53015,"Yes, that'd be entirely out of character."
53016,"You lost the trust of the people of Skyrim, Elisif. You had your chance to make the right choice when the war started."
53017,"Um, good. We reward loyalty, you know."
53018,Obey!
53019,"When I grow up, will I go to the College in Winterhold?"
53021,And I'm sure Barbas doesn't want me to have that axe. He'd want it this way.
53022,Nothing? And what of my son? Hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!
53023,Let me know if you hear anything more substantial?
53024,"Aye, but I'll be here in Solitude for longer still. Fihada's skill as a fletcher drew me to this place. I wanted to learn."
53025,Just what I was thinking.
53027,Damn right.
53028,A man like me makes a lot of enemies. People are always trying to cheat me.
53030,"Bryling owns the mine, and she's not selling. We make her some decent coin running this place. Keeps her living well in Solitude."
53032,"Let 'em go, Hewnon. All clear."
53035,The Arch-Mage triumphant! The College... Skyrim... All of Tamriel owes you a great debt!
53036,"Got a problem with a prisoner? Get a shiv. Hear Grisvar has a spare, if you could get him to part with it."
53037,Let's go see if Esbern's right about Alduin's Wall.
53044,I'd say it's time you put your nose to the grindstone and figure it out for yourself. You claim to be a thief... act like one.
53052,Now get out of here and to the outpost! I need to know what's happening out there.
53054,"He he. Thanks, papa."
53055,I shall inform you the moment something noteworthy happens.
53056,Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
53058,Take this with our gratitude.
53062,Seen some mean-spirited folk pass through lately. Thought I was rid of those sorts when I left Markarth.
53065,"Think, please, just for a moment, about what he would do if he knew its true value."
53068,"I've seen enough to know their fabric. The warp of air, the weft of time."
53070,"He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure."
53071,The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him.
53072,"I don't think Rikke even knows my name. Probably because I'm not ""The Dragonborn."""
53073,"They'll have barricades set, destroy them quickly. Keep pressing forward."
53075,"Yes, yes. Here it is. I think I'd best be off now."
53076,Well... we could use some breathing space to regroup. Things haven't been going well for us lately.
53077,"Now... Well, let's just say the front door doesn't get much use."
53083,"You see, there's a contract out on one of them, and that person can't leave this room alive. But... which one? Go on, see if you can figure it out."
53085,"Mark my words, the war will be over in a matter of months. Once Ulfric sees the full might of the Empire, I'm sure he'll come to his senses."
53087,Didn't I speak clear enough? Out of my way.
53088,"Yes. Yes, fine, I'll come to this Greybeard council. For all the good it will do."
53089,That's good news. I was starting to fear something had happened.
53091,"Watch your back, friend. Better yet, pay me to do it for you."
53093,What are you waiting for? Let's get this over with.
53094,Nothing happens in Riften without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend the rest of the fourth era in prison. 
53095,He watches over all Orcs as his children. A truth those who leave the stronghold are quick to forget.
53096,Nid!
53097,Horvutah med kodaav. Caught like a bear in a trap...
53098,Zu'u bonaar. You went to a great deal of trouble to put me in this... humiliating position.
53101,What did you want to know?
53103,"In the manner of dreams, I cannot escape. I'm forced to wait and watch."
53104,"He has travelled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor... the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards..."
53105,Unslaad krosis. Innumerable pardons. I digress.
53106,Working in Windhelm is great. I get to see Ulfric up close.
53107,Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
53109,"By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be."
53110,"Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin."
53111,Hmm... the Empire is bringing in a lot of supplies through Dawnstar. Taking the Pale would stretch them pretty thin...
53113,"Now, did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?"
53114,Good man. You won't regret it.
53115,Why didn't you say so immediately?!
53117,Indeed.  Alduin wahlaan daanii.
53119,Many thanks!
53120,As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself slipping away.
53122,Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect me too.
53125,"Please, just let me be..."
53126,"Whatever it is, I'm sure I can't be of help. I'm just here on... holiday."
53127,Most bandits are cowards. These seem to be braver than most.
53128,"Yes, well. Perhaps someone else in the village can assist you? Please, you're starting to... frighten me."
53130,Psijics? Here now? What in Talos' name...
53131,"Yes, father."
53135,"""Night of Tears"", by Dranor Seleth. Old book, one I'd forgotten about. This thing here... it might be what the book was about."
53136,"And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim... on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that."
53138,That's nothing you need to concern yourself with.
53139,So go dig at the other corner for a bit.
53140,"Thank you. Please, take this. It can't quite compare to an Elder Scroll, but still. You will be remembered for generations for this."
53141,"But the implications are quite intriguing, I think. I simply need some experimental results to confirm my suspicions."
53142,Yeah.
53143,"Here, take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader."
53144,Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Camilla.
53145,I should be back in Windhelm. I've got work to do.
53146,"You found it? Ha ha ha. There it is. Strange... it seems smaller than I remember. Funny thing, huh?"
53147,Too slow!
53148,Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we...
53149,How about I trade you a song for some fruit?
53150,"Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?"
53154,Give him the Rueful Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.
53155,Get it away from me. Get it away!
53156,"Ah, kill it. Kill it!"
53157,"And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener... just spoke. Right now..."
53158,I'll end your miserable life!
53162,That's a good man.
53164,"We'll begin as soon as you're wearing the hat. Check the shelf over there. Wouldn't want the Emperor mistaking you for someone else, now would we. "
53165,There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel. 
53168,I know life on the docks isn't easy. Sometimes life puts you in difficult circumstances you didn't choose.
53169,"Oh, well... I suppose that's a noble cause. I'll settle this bill at the end of the day. Thank you."
53170,Hey! Those belong to my family!
53171,"I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out."
53172,Bandits know nothing of pity or mercy. No need to show them any either.
53174,"Oh, I'm fine, Enmon. I just... I still miss her."
53175,"Only Paarthurnax, the master of our order, can answer that question, if he so chooses."
53176,"Almost the opposite. The College got rid of something... someone, that was too much trouble."
53177,"But thanks to the Blades, you now have questions that only Paarthurnax can answer."
53181,Poor Pavo and Gat. To have lived through a Forsworn attack.
53182,You weren't ready. You still aren't ready.
53183,I'm busy. Don't you have something to do?
53185,There's no mistake. You're a wanted man... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
53188,The temple is still not clean. Get to it.
53189,Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.
53192,"Gemma. This town is called ""Kynesgrove."" That stand of trees is Kyne's Grove. You don't honestly think you can just cut some down."
53193,"Astrid did the right thing, and now it's your turn. End her suffering."
53194,"No... No, this cannot be..."
53196,"Still, you have a point. Camilla letting Faendal visit her isn't a good thing for me."
53198,Nazir told me what happened in Solitude. You poor dear. You've been through so much...
53199,"I don't usually deal in weapons, but I know someone who can get them for me. You mind paying a little extra to get them fast?"
53201,"All right, please stay close to me while we're inside. It should be safe, but it's always better to be cautious."
53203,"Delvin, please tell me you have good news."
53204,"Set an ambush on the road between, or camp one of the inns."
53205,"We're getting Thorald back, no matter what."
53206,"I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well."
53207,Keep going! We need to get farther away from here!
53209,This rain will stop eventually. Always does.
53211,I'll work my spells and potions for whoever is willing to leave Dawnstar in peace.
53213,Thank you. The Eight keep you.
53214,"Well fought, ya swinging bit of skeever bait."
53216,I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins.
53217,What was that? Some kind of foreign move?
53220,Damn boot-lover.
53221,Go! Now!
53222,"I'm afraid I'm running errands at the moment. But please, visit me later at the Temple of the Divines."
53224,Damn it. Why'd you have to walk into Morthal?
53225,"Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand. Or who you stand with."
53226,It's been so long since I tasted my own blood. Sour.
53227,"Next time you're looking to pester someone, make sure it's the right person!"
53228,I... won't... surrender!
53229,Your fists speak louder than your words.
53230,I don't believe it. I guess you were right!
53231,Here... take your damn coin and get out of here!
53232,The Dawnstar Sanctuary? That where you lot are holing up in now? Hmm... Tell you what. It'll cost you - a lot - but I can help you out.
53236,"Too bad. That's what we're playing, and you're the Elf. Now go hide so I can hunt you!"
53238,"Silana, you don't seem yourself. Is something the matter?"
53239,"Fine! I'll take care of it, just please leave me alone!"
53240,For all of us. 
53241,"I don't know. Beem-Ja has looked after me since I was knee-high to him. I need to rest, and then I think I'm going back to High Rock."
53242,All right. Tell the old man his debts are settled.
53244,"He told me to make sure you didn't get in the way. That's all I know, I swear!"
53248,"You win. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me ever again."
53249,Ever think about spending more time around town?
53251,You really think we can kill a dragon?
53252,Yeah. Here.
53254,"For this reason, I avoid them when I can."
53258,That you have. Here.
53261,"Laelette thought she could take me and keep me, but she can't. I'm all burned up."
53263,"This may have begun as a minor amusement, but it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff."
53264,I guess I shouldn't boast so much... it gets expensive!
53265,Of course... I could fly you there. But not while imprisoned like this.
53268,"They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine?"
53269,"However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands and shut us out. He needs to be taught a lesson."
53270,"I found a willing subject for you. Payment has already been discussed, of course. "
53271,"I won't say it again, Vignar - Talos worship is forbidden. It's the Empire's law, and we're still a part of the Empire."
53272,"Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild."
53273,I'm not sure what this is all about.
53278,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
53280, 
53283, 
53284,"You stay out of trouble, now. The Castle Dour dungeon can break even the strongest will."
53285, 
53286, 
53287,Glory to the Forsworn!
53290,It'll be there. You'll see.
53291,"Haha. I knew it! No woman yet born has been able to resist my charms for long. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one."
53292,"What have I done, Listener? Has Cicero offended you?"
53293,Thank you. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for you when you return.
53295,Something troublin' ya? I'll listen.
53297,Sorry to hear that.
53298,Terrible. Only a matter of time before soldiers come and burn all my hard work into dust!
53299,"Bah! Save your magic. A warrior should face her foe, not hide from him."
53301,"Sure you finished, but you killed someone to do it. Next time listen to the rules if you want to get paid."
53302,"Shor's bones, here he comes!"
53303,"Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques."
53307,We shall safeguard it... for now.
53309,Huzzah!
53310,Don't just stand there! Kill him!
53311,Good. Did she say anything we need to know?
53312,Just in time. I was worried I'd have to do this myself.
53314,"I thank you. Here, please accept this as a token of my appreciation for your selfless action."
53315,"What do you say now, Proventus? Shall we continue to trust in the strength of our walls? Against a dragon?"
53317,"Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me."
53323,"Uh huh. I'm sure he runs outside with the coin and throws it up in the air so Mara herself can catch it. Come off of it, Bolli."
53325,"You may be my wife, but this is my business, so just do your job. Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of gold left over to waste on trinkets."
53326,"Very well, please use it for food."
53327,"Ah, but you care little for politics, am I right? You want money! And money you shall have!"
53329,There's always the Thieves Guild.
53330,Excellent. Follow me to the targets and we'll begin.
53334,Maven! Always a pleasure to receive you. What can I help you with today?
53336,"You have a kind heart. I'd be honored to walk by your side until the trees themselves fade away, if you would have me."
53339,Od!
53340,Taking care of the entire hold is another matter entirely. It would be a big enough job without the war on and the dragons about.
53341,"Thank you, Laila."
53342,"I was expecting more though, you'd better be good."
53344,"It's the things she makes here, the things she says and all those poor little animals she tests them on. It's just not right."
53345,Finally! Let's end this.
53346,I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory.
53347,Not impressed!
53348,"Most impressive, mortal... most impressive."
53349,Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own.
53355,Look at you. Wearing an Amulet of Mara. Are you saying you're available?
53360,"So, you're the one Brynjolf's been jabberin' about. Been waitin' to have a word with you."
53361,No.
53363,"We drink to our youth, to days come and gone. For the age of aggression is just about done."
53364,"What did you do to me? What am I made of? Air? Shadow? Oh, this is not good..."
53366,"Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you."
53368,"I found the ring's resting place after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now."
53369,You sure? It was in your handwriting. If you can't keep the books straight then let me do them.
53370,What I need? What I need is for Alain Dufont to die! I want him hunted down and murdered like the dog he is!
53372,"Lucan over in the Riverwood Trader says thieves broke into his store. Strange, he says they hardly took anything."
53373,"Oh, good. I was really afraid I'd lose it forever."
53375,I know that!
53376,"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my sister around. It's comforting."
53377,Give Mercer my regards when you return to Riften.
53378,"You're a good man, Maramal. We're lucky to have you watching over us."
53385,And my Aunt wouldn't have to worry about her daughter.
53386,You look kind of scary. But nobody is scarier than old Grelod.
53387,Ha! I'd sooner bend my knee to Ulfric Stormcloak.
53388,"Then by Talos, you do what you feel you're meant to do. I'll take care of your father for you."
53389,It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight for to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?
53391,"Yes, Listener? How can Cicero be of service?"
53392,"No. I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste."
53393,And what did you say to that?
53395,You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people; to fight to keep us free.
53398,You're disgusting! Don't you even think of laying a finger on me or I'll cut off something you can't live without.
53399,"Now I'll show you to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly."
53402,"Back from a job, huh? Hope it went well."
53403,Ready to go?
53405,Outsiders. Nothing but trouble.
53406,So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.
53407,Riften has problems of its own. Now is not the time for exploration and discovery.
53410,What are you saying? You think I had something to do with that?
53413,You know him?
53415,Give him one more week to think about it.
53416,I've known Bersi a long time. Even before he opened that rubbish heap he calls a shop.
53417,You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently by devouring its soul.
53418,And if he still refuses?
53419,"It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says ""sand elske."""
53420,I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.
53422,He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place - has someone bring him food and such.
53424,I do hope you know what your doing with those flames. It would be quite a shame if something caught fire.
53425,"Important? Far more than even she realizes! If you are Dragonborn, then..."
53429,I'm afraid it's not that simple.
53430,"The coin isn't just for the men, there's a lot of people that need to be compensated in order to make this happen."
53431,I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
53435,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm certain Bolli would be happy to lend you a few septims."
53436,No. Not possible.
53437,Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows.
53438,I can't afford to just give my jewelry away!
53439,"Please, milady, it was only because he threatened me. He said he'd have me thrown in the prisons if I didn't give him what he wanted!"
53440,"Next time a Black-Briar asks for something, I suggest you respond quickly and affirmatively."
53441,I trust my parents are well?
53442,Are you ready to test yourself at Fort Hraagstad?
53445,It shall be so.
53447,I've brought a friend. Someone who can help. A bodyguard. To protect you.
53448,"His father before him perhaps, but not Torygg. "
53450,I'm pretty sure she up and joined the Stormcloaks.
53451,I damn near met my end in that war. An Aldmeri soldier ran me through with his blade and left me for dead.
53452,I believe it to be a falsehood perpetrated by the Empire in order to weaken the citizen's confidence in your ability to rule.
53453,I'm just a poor man trying to make a living. I'd leave Morthal were it in my power.
53455,"My lady, Maven Black-Briar has sent word that she requires your seal in order to expand her shipments into Morrowind."
53456,"Mother, how long must we put up with Saerlund spouting his nonsense about the Empire?"
53458,"What would you have me do, send him to the gallows for treason? He's your brother, Harrald."
53460,"Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it."
53463,"Harrald, I have need of you."
53464,"Stop moping about, girl. Tears won't change what you've done."
53465,"Been hoping they'd make me a guard, but not yet. Still, I'll help them out if I can."
53466,"Yes, I've heard such things. Anuriel assures me they're just fabrications and there's nothing down there save a few stray skeever."
53467,"But I believe the Scroll's bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a... a seeing, a vision of the moment of its creation."
53470,"You're headed to The Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison."
53472,"You've changed, brother. And not for the better I'm afraid."
53473,These fissures and cracks aren't encouraging. Malyn obviously was growing more desparate once he left the College.
53475,Lets see how tough you are without Sam keeping an eye on you.
53479,"How dare you take that kind of tone. You're in service to me, remember?"
53481,"You're forgiven. Now, I want to know if you've made any progress with my son. Is he cursed? Has he been possessed?"
53482,"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here."
53483,I enjoyed our talk.
53484,Why are we stopping?
53485,"General, you've proven yourself a good friend to Skyrim. I continue to trust that you will do your utmost to safeguard our interests."
53487,"And when he stands in Namira's presence, she will take care of the rest."
53488, 
53490, 
53491,Marvelous.
53493,Umurn and Nagrub will be held up as weak next to the son I will one day bear for my chief.
53495,Sigrid! We have company!
53498,I'm here to lend my magic to the people of Dawnstar.
53500,No. I'm telling you. There was no other reason.
53501,J'zargo had expected to be named Arch-Mage. But there is still time.
53503,"Unlike some folks here in town, we have nothing against the College or the people that come and go."
53504,Must...kill.
53506,You...must...die.
53508,The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods.
53510,"Yield, and I may still show mercy!"
53513,"Aye, there will be blood today. I can promise you that."
53514,What manner of magic is this?
53515,Was there something else?
53517,"Come on, show me what you've got!"
53518,Argh!
53520,I will stay right here and wait for you to bring me what I need.
53521,"Come on, fight back!"
53522,You're already dead.
53523,"I'm always on the lookout for all sorts of goods. Bring me whatever you... well, ""find"" and I'll see what I can do."
53524,You should respect your elders!
53525,I've outlived worse than this!
53528,The White take you!
53529,You're no match for me!
53530,Jewelry for sale. Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
53531,"Steal from anywhere in the hold, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?"
53532,Gat and I are the only survivors.
53533,"I don't care if we share the same ancestors, these people are savages. Half of them are Forsworn barbarians, and have you seen what they eat?"
53537,I won't back down!
53541,No one crosses me!
53542,Wizards. Why is it always wizards.
53543,"You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it."
53545,"I'm working on some very important research, I assure you."
53547,Busy with the smelter.
53548,Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content.
53549,Graaah! I'll get you!
53550,You won't get away from me!
53555,Pray to your gods for mercy!
53556,Beg for your miserable life!
53557,It wasn't until recently that I heard Mercer Frey and this Dark Elf named Karliah were a part of that group.
53558,Take your best shot!
53561,For blood! For glory!
53562,"Look at those ruins. How long have they stood here, I wonder?"
53563,I'll skin you alive!
53565,Father won't let me go see the dragon.
53566,"No, and at this rate, I never shall!"
53567,Thank you!
53570,"Oh, hello! Just tidying up."
53572,"This is Stormcloak territory. If you're one of those craven Imperials, don't expect a warm welcome."
53574,"So, you in for a little fishin'?"
53575,Put up a real fight!
53576,"My job? Well, I'm the Watcher of the Wheel! Which is... exactly what it sounds like. I watch the Wheel."
53577,"We're done here, I think."
53578,Show me what you've got!
53579,You don't have a chance!
53580,Victory or Sovngarde!
53582,This ends now!
53583,"I swear, I'll kill you!"
53584,This is the end for you!
53587,You ready to die today? Huh?
53590,"Even here, where heroes throng, few can match this mighty deed. What glory! The gods themselves must envy us this well-earned honor!"
53592,You think you can take me?
53593,I'll rip your heart out!
53596,Shor have mercy on you!
53604,"Stormcloaks or Imperials. Either way, all they want is everything for free and you to lick their boots."
53606,"Now... I don't really want to touch that thing, though. Do you think you could handle the next steps?"
53607,Woah... watch it!
53608,"Until then, here. This is for you, in thanks."
53609,"Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him."
53610,Slay it! Slay the dragon!
53612,"Oh, we do all right. Rumor is, you had a hand in the Blackblood Marauders' demise..."
53615,Hrmph. Breaking a curse is not a simple thing. It is dangerous.
53617,An unguessed trove of lost lore... but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew.
53619,Although... it might be difficult to persuade the Jarl to allow you to use his palace as a dragon trap...
53620,Um...
53621,The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
53623,Mortal fool! No one hides from the dead!
53625,Let's get to the Forsworn camp. Her life could be in danger.
53626,What? That little tease! Leading me on and turning cold at the last minute. I don't think so.
53627,Come inside. The other masters will meet us there.
53628,"I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible..."
53631,Let me see if I can get that door open.
53632,What do you think the Imperials would be doing while this dragon is busy slaughtering my men?
53635,I can't talk now.
53636,You must find it! It cannot end this way! Not after I've worked so hard!
53637,Funny thing is his stupid Thieves Guild never counted on me and my partner blocking the way.
53638,Mara can't help me. No one can.
53639,Thanks!
53640,How can you say that? This mine was filled with draugr not too long ago.
53641,"I beg of you, can you bring me Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice."
53642,"If you've got some time, stop by my House of Curiosities. I promise you'll see wonders!"
53643,"I have payments to make you realize. If I can't make them, I can't make Black-Briar Mead."
53644,Of course not. You expect me to take care of it by myself?
53645,"Oh. Oh yes! Yes, the kindly stranger can certainly help!"
53647,"A fine place to trap one of Alduin's allies, hmm?"
53648,"We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner."
53649,Thank you very much for your business.
53652,Good to see you. Come on in.
53654,Brond's one of the most savage fighters I've ever seen...
53657,"Grrr. Fine, let's get this over with."
53660,"They'd be hiding it, of course. Wouldn't want it to get out that they've been lying this whole time."
53661,"What happened to my Skyrim? Everywhere you look, cats, lizards and elves. It's sickening."
53663,"Camilla, I've seen her talking to that Faendal. Filthy elf needs to keep to his own kind..."
53664,Sven has the voice of a snow lark. Only good thing he got from his father.
53665,"Nobody believes me, but I tell you, I saw a dragon!"
53667,Papa says I'm not ready for weapons. So I make lots of horseshoes and hobnails.
53668,I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all.
53669,"Excellent. Once Alain is dead, I'll pay you. In gold. I've saved up a bit. I hope that'll do."
53671,I could forge you a warhammer that would crush a giant's head like a walnut.
53672,Iron and steel mostly. I might even have some of your fancy Elven pieces lying around somewhere...
53674,Iron or steel is what you need. Leave that fancy Elven stuff to the Elves.
53675,Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
53676,"Whatever you need. By Ysmir, if it's simple and strong, I can forge it."
53679,You hear anything?
53680,"I know some of it looks like junk, but everything's a treasure in the right light."
53681,"Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day."
53683,The Riverwood Trader is everything you need in a general store.
53684,Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?
53686,"I'd hoped we could work something out, that you would see reason."
53689,"Don't go stopping for a nap. If you fall asleep in this place, you'll never wake up."
53692,"Most of my customers are locals, come to relax after a hard day's toil."
53693,We don't get a lot of travelers here in Riverwood.
53694,I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.
53696,"Dragonborn, do whatever you're going to do!"
53697,"But what you fail to realize is that you involved yourself in this ""insanity"" when you took Grelod's life. You made your choice."
53698,Why would they be looking at me? Are they upset about the service?
53699,"Winterhold belongs to Skyrim, not the Imperials, or the Mages."
53700,"Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me."
53701,It's so good to see you again.
53703,"Move along, citizen."
53704,If only Camilla shared my affections. Or even knew about them.
53706,"There's beauty here unmatched in all of Skyrim, to be sure."
53707,"Greetings, brother Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home."
53708,All right. Mother is just outside this door. I have a plan.
53709,"But, never mind all that. We've got a job to do. Don't we?"
53712,"I don't know who you are, or what's going on here, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
53714,"Ooh, ooh, what kind of message? A song? A summons? Wait, I know! A death threat written on the back of an Argonian concubine! Those are my favorite."
53716,"How are the necklaces selling, my wife? We could make more."
53722,"You're new around here, so I'll go easy on ya. But don't get on my bad side."
53723,"Yes, I'm ready to do my part."
53724,You met Camilla yet? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on those trunks. He he he he.
53726,You're not tiresome like the rest of the people I have the displeasure of dealing with on a regular basis. Here. I'd like you to have this.
53727,"Not only that, but these Nords have no love for us. They look upon us and see only thieves and smugglers."
53728,"Me, I've got my axe, my wife Gerdur and my boy Frodnar. That's all I need."
53729,"Yes, my lord."
53730,"I oppose tyranny. I oppose those who tell me how to live, what to think, and what to believe."
53731,"You like living in this filthy slum, dark elves? Maybe you should go back to Morrowind, where you belong!"
53733,I knew it was at the Dead Man's Respite.
53734,"Years past, the lumber was used for houses or furniture. Now, the soldiers just buy it all."
53735,Our families been close as kin for generations.
53738,"So we're not going to talk about this any more, right? Because I don't want to."
53739,Maybe I'll do turnips next. Hmmm... Or maybe radishes?
53740,Do you remember the sun? Because you'll forget. Soon.
53741,"Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway."
53743,"Excuse me, but do you know anything about this house? Seen anyone enter or leave?"
53744,"Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the Thalmor smashed us during the Great War."
53750,I haven't seen you before. Have I? Have we met? I'm sorry if I've forgotten. 
53751,All this talk of rebellion and strife. Too many are focused on what might be instead of what is. It tires me to talk about it.
53753,"I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College."
53754,I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself.
53755,I will feast on your soul in Sovngarde!
53756,Have we? 
53759,That woman and her Thalmor Justiciars have caused nothing but problems for the people of Skyrim.
53760,"I assure you, I have nothing of value. I'm nothing but a poor woodcutter just trying to make ends meet."
53761,Its been difficult. I've taken the burdens of this city's problems upon myself and I keep running into impossible obstacles.
53762,"I must have collapsed, because the next thing I remember is Aerin standing over me tending to my wounds."
53763,They're holed up in some old dwarven ruin - Raldbthar. It's near Windhelm. They use it as their base. It's where they stage their raids.
53767,I can't wait to see Sabjorn squirm.
53768,It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim.
53770,"I'm originally from Cyrodiil, sent here at the request of the Emperor himself. I'm often ordered to places with problems that need fixing."
53772,But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away.
53774,I'd be glad to help a friend of Hadvar. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?
53776,To call it a guild is ridiculous. How can people who would betray one another over a gold coin be considered part of an association?
53777,"I hate seeing a good mine go to waste like that, you know?"
53778,Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm stuck down here.
53781,"My wife Hafjorg, well, she's a necessary evil I suppose. Not a lick of talent when it comes to alchemy, but she keeps me fed."
53782,I'm so confused. What's happening?
53783,I understand. Speaking to a goddess is overwhelming for many. Return when you're prepared.
53787,"Tell you what. If you need any stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good money for them."
53789,That isn't an option. Maven sees me serve a competitor's brand here and we may as well dig our own graves.
53791,"So far, if only because no one is telling me how great I ought to be."
53792,"Damn it, Talen. We still don't have enough this year to get out of Riften."
53795,Maybe they're afraid of you. Maybe it's your breath. How should I know?
53796,They always try to take advantage of me. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
53797,"Magic is... frowned upon in Skyrim. Only the mages at the College of Winterhold teach it freely. If you wish to learn, join them."
53798,It's been a long time since anyone joined us. Seems like people are in a rush to leave.
53799,"Precisely. But it's not as simple as enchanting Malyn away. He's put up barriers. Souls are only allowed in, not out."
53800,I don't know Bolli. It's getting dangerous outside the walls.
53801,"That's not funny, Bolli. People are scared."
53802,I can be trusted. I know this. But they do not. Onikaan ni ov dovah. It is always wise to mistrust a dovah.
53804,"Well, then you won't be leaving here at all."
53805,"Lost funt. You are too late, Alduin!"
53806, 
53807,"You may have picked up the weapons of my ancient foes, but you are not their equal!"
53808,It's a little gift from the dwarves. Who knew they would end up helping our cause?
53814,"When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either."
53815,What? The bo... Oh. Oh dear.
53817,"Orgnar, hold down the bar for a minute, will you?"
53818,"You! Please, help me!"
53822,"Stick close. Damn rebels could be anywhere. Don't worry, though. General Tullius will have them on the run soon enough."
53824,"Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that it's not."
53826,"You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a traitor's death."
53827,We'll get by.
53828,My husband just gets cranky when he doesn't get enough sleep.
53829,"But you went there, didn't you? Isn't that where you learned?"
53834,"If Alduin himself could not stand against your Thu'um, I feel no shame in my own defeat."
53835,But...
53838,"Well, I guess that's good enough... let's be off..."
53839,See that you do.
53840,Because an unfocused mind will almost certainly be obliterated. Destroyed by the forces you attempt to control and yield.
53842,I had a bad dream again last night.
53844,"Never forget, the most important job of any bard is to entertain. The day you lose your audience is the day you cut your lute strings."
53846,"You know, the law here in Solitude can be a bit... ""flexible."" So long as you've got the gold. That's the way the Thieves Guild likes it."
53847,"I feel wonderful, just like every night."
53850,I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; the people won't stop blathering about you.
53851,"Oh, look! We have company!"
53853,Lead me into battle.
53856,"Good. They've had their victories, but Tullius is no fool. The Empire can't afford to keep this up much longer."
53857,"Vekel and me, we have a thing going. So I recommend you keep your hands off the merchandise."
53858,You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
53859,"Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things. Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel..."
53861,Buy you a drink?
53862,Maybe this is a way out?
53864,"Still the same. I tell you, something's got to be done."
53865,"When the time is right, friend. When we're sure."
53866,"The Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price."
53869,That's a brave offer. I'd be happy to throw in my coin behind that.
53870,"Alright, but if you ever want to leave that old curmudgeon I've got plenty for you to do at Gentle Repose."
53871,"But without Ulfric, the movement will wither and die. It's only a matter of time."
53874,Aeri's the boss. Should talk to her if you want work.
53876,I don't need to talk to you. Get lost.
53877,All right... End it...
53879,Someone's after me I tell you. They're watching me. Somewhere.
53880,"If you wanna be a damn fool, go to the College in Winterhold instead."
53882,The people here are still plagued with nightmares. It's... unnatural.
53886,"Finally, the Nords took over around Tiber Septim's time. That bent a few folks' arms the wrong way."
53887,I really need your help! I don't want to lose my job at the fishery! What am I going to do?
53889,That can be arranged.
53892,"Oh, stop being such a grouch! Not every visitor to the farm wants to burn it down! Maybe they just want to have a nice supper with us, hmm?"
53894,And another soul for Sithis.
53895,Damn thieves. As if things weren't bad enough.
53896,Old Elven fella named Calcelmo is up in Understone Keep's the one you want to talk to for more about that. Wrote all those books.
53898,"That's right, at least according to them scholars. Stonework's clearly not Nord, that much is for sure."
53902,"You'd think that'd be the end of it, but those Forsworn are still in the hills, and they're as wild as wolves."
53903,That's right. Whole group of the natives called the Forsworn rose up against the Nords. Drove them out.
53905,I've finally located Vokun's crypt! The scroll I'm looking for just has to be here.
53906,And what do Legion soldiers know about the hills the Reach? And the caves that make up those hills? The Forsworn can hide and ambush every assault.
53909,Not here. Come with me.
53910,"Not all of us, just the members of the Circle. We shouldn't be talking about this anyway."
53911,Blessings of Talos upon you.
53915,Don't fall.
53917,I can't imagine where he found the gold to take it to market so quickly.
53919,"It'll be lean times for the Reach with a Silver-Blood ruling it, that's for certain."
53920,"Since the Stormcloaks took over, Jarl Thongvor is in charge. "
53922,"Bold words, but true. Fine, you win. I'll pay the Argonians more coin."
53927,"It's the whole reason Ulfric revolted against the Empire. Well, the first reason anyway."
53928,The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod characters showed up some months ago looking for it.
53930,Alduin mahlaan
53932,"Ah. Ha ha! Come here, come here come here come here!"
53934,It's frightening living below their monastery.
53936,"I don't know what your aunts told you, but..."
53937,It's good to have another quick-eyed Shield-Sister in the hall. Come to me with any troubles.
53938,We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade alone this day.
53941,"Hey. That armor. You got rid of it, yeah? I can take it, no problem?"
53942,"But none have yet stood against Alduin himself. Galthor, Sorri, Birkir..."
53943,Take the mark if you want it. It's not worth all this hassle anyway.
53944,What does that mean Reberrus? Are we winning or aren't we?
53945,The trouble is that I can't seem to speak around her.
53946,"I hardly think the bears are clever enough to hold a grudge against you, Miss Temba."
53947,Skyrim will be free!
53948,"It's no use! Use the Scroll, Felldir! Now!"
53953,"It was established by Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago. When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit."
53954,"It's a small town, with one rather unique feature - it houses Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost."
53957,"It is our way, and I am proud to follow my people's traditions, but I can't help but feel chained."
53958,"Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up."
53960,"There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro and the Stormcloaks in the Emperor's assassination."
53963,What do you need?
53964,"You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand?"
53966,Stop bothering me Aicanter!
53968,"Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine."
53969,Finally! My prayers have been answered!
53972,"If you're staying the night, I've got a free room."
53973,"Oh, do you need a room?"
53976,"Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?"
53977,"Quit taking advantage of us and this world might be a better place, you got that?"
53978,"Look, I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father."
53979,"You think anyone around here is going to lift a shovel to help me? Guess again. ""Leave the dirty work to old Alessandra."""
53980,"You stand now at the precipice of the Void. I am reminded of another Listener, a protege I knew long ago. So long ago..."
53986,Kill her. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
53991,Glad my father seems to have found someone. I just hope she can hold her own against my aunts.
53994,Don't worry about them. We'll make sure they wash up safe. Maybe they'll even pay us for the heroic rescue from their sad crash.
53995,The smelter!
53996,"My parents are long dead, but they lived wonderful lives... I have no sad stories to tell about them. Perhaps one day I'll visit their resting place."
53997,"Stay out of trouble, Redguard."
53998,"As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing."
54001,"Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man."
54002,Keep it away from me!
54003,"""Night of Tears"", eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting."
54004,"Fascinating! So the ancients were more daring... or foolhardy... similar to the Dragon Break itself, although less far-reaching..."
54005,"You have done well thus far, but trying times are ahead."
54007,"I think I know, but go ahead."
54010,"Uh... yeah. I know you don't mind hurting people. Just look what you did to... well, you know."
54015,"Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that."
54016,"He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order."
54019,You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left him?
54020,Uncle Alvor! Hello!
54021,"Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here. I need every piece polished to a fine shine."
54022,"Oho, so that's where you went."
54028, 
54030,Another filthy cave. Always so dark.
54031,The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.
54033,"If these Nords don't let up soon, I might just make a break for it. At least Cyrodiil is warmer than this."
54035,Aghh! Just... die already!
54036,I'm going to enjoy this!
54040,"This is none of your concern, citizen."
54043,Your fealty is precious to me. I will make good use of it.
54050,You've made Narfi so happy! Narfi now waits for his sister until she comes home.
54051,Everything you see here was made with skill and care by my wife Adrianne.
54052,So what do you want to know?
54053,I didn't think you had the stomach for it.
54054,"No, I'm not Arnleif. Yes, I know it's called Arnleif and Sons. "
54057,"Not much. But as a bard, I find the whole affair depressing."
54061,I'm disappointed in your failure. But the Empire still needs you. I'll have to over look it for now.
54071,"Thank you. This should turn that old cat's gaze. Maybe I'll be able to become a caravaneer myself, one day."
54073,Thank Mara. I was afraid I'd never be able to convince you.
54074,It will work if we can pull Hran's men from the south. And find a bit of luck.
54075,Need a room? Maybe a drink? You name it.
54077,The old gods give me strength!
54081,J'zargo knows that you will save the College. You must.
54082,"Come to see Balimund perform miracles with steel, eh?"
54084,"We sell bows, arrows and ale. A unique combination, to be sure."
54085,What did you want?
54089,I could crack the lock on any house blindfolded before you even got your picks out of your pocket.
54090,"Odfel, I've told you time and time again. I'm not interested in a relationship with you."
54094,It's those damned Blackblood Marauders. They're scaring off shipping.
54096,"I wish the Nords, Argonians and dark elves in Windhelm got along better."
54103,Jarl Ulfric.
54104,"Skyrim is a beautiful and harsh mistress, but her people cling to such a petty notion of honor."
54105,This is the last time I'll say it. Get out.
54106,It's very important you do this correctly.
54108,"I married Thonar for the money, and I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit it."
54112,"I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you."
54116,Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.
54117,And I suppose the Cruel-Seas would be just the clan to provide ships and men? 
54118,But you're right. This should scatter the rest of them. I can go back to my life for now.
54120,I wish Bothela was still running the store. I'm not ready for this.
54122,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
54123, 
54125,Well. I wish it were that simple.
54129,"Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry to have troubled you about it."
54130,"Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again."
54132,He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back.
54139,The Nords of those days used the Dragonrend Shout to cripple Alduin. But this was not enough. Ok mulaag unslaad.
54141,"Ah, so you're an alchemist, then?"
54143,That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.
54144,My daughter Karita sings to the guests when she can. She has her mother's voice.
54151,"Edda... she's crazy as a loon, but at least she doesn't have the mind to realize what a horrible world this is. She's the lucky one."
54152,Iron-Breaker Mine is three times the worth of that Quicksilver Mine and its fat-head owner.
54155,"I'm pleased when the palace is clean, I'm pleased when the beds are made on time, I'm pleased when I Erdi isn't around."
54156,"You were told to find it, weren't you?"
54159,"But now he's refusing to deliver. Could you perhaps speak with him, and see if we can come to some sort of arrangement?"
54163,Did you tell him you were Dragonborn? I didn't think so.
54168,Hi there.
54171,Where did all these pretty red plants come from?
54174,"So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!"
54176,You're a fool to fight me!
54177,"This must be him, then."
54178,"Very well, but when their emissary arrives I want words with him."
54185,"To arms, boys! To arms!"
54186,Bandits are cowards. Don't strain yourself chasing them all down.
54190,"Watch your step, Markarth has quite a reputation thanks to the Silver-Blood family. I wouldn't advise crossing them."
54192,"Come on, she's not so tough."
54196,Fine. Then it will be an honor to kill you for your offenses against my kin.
54198,"My mother taught me. She was a Bard, from the college in Solitude."
54199,"I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up."
54200,"Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there."
54203,Kodlak says not to worry about it. I worry that a bunch of snowberries are out there earning glory while we stay out of it.
54207,Strun...
54210,I. Will. Destroy you!
54211,See that you do. I will not let Windhelm descend into chaos over a few overactive imaginations.
54213,"Right now, the best you could provide is coin. We need all the help we can get."
54214,"Mirabelle does a fine job as Master Wizard, I suppose. Still, there's always room for improvement."
54226,Yyyyrrrraaaaahhhhh!
54228,Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came.
54231,What's she rummaging around in there for?
54242,"Gods, it's a wonder it's in one piece!"
54246,They're at the gate!
54247,Your fate is sealed!
54250,"If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to."
54260,Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.
54261,Bandits attacked and ransacked my cart. Can you help me?
54263,Have you talked to Nazir? He's sure to have some additional contracts for you.
54265,What guidance could you offer me?
54267,But only the Greybeards study the Way of the Voice any more. If you can Shout... you need to talk to them.
54268,"I've got a bad grip on my shield, could you take a look at it?"
54271,But let me warn you - joining the Legion is for life. Any previous loyalties... I trust we understand each other.
54274,"Feel free to take a seat, or pray at the shrines. We appreciate worship in all its forms."
54278,"You're not really supposed to... you know, be here."
54286,"She's as stubborn as she is beautiful, isn't she? Glad you found a way to get her to pay."
54288,You dare approach me here? Are you mad? You cannot hope to defeat me!
54289,"Between you and me, she could use a bit of warmth."
54292,Don't let my sister do anything foolish.
54293,Good luck. Lucan and I will be waiting for you back in the shop.
54294,Excellent. Very good. This is exactly what I need to complete a series of studies I'm doing on Dwemer craftsmanship and magical resonance.
54295,"This is all your fault, you know."
54299,"You have worked here in the Treasury House for a long time, haven't you Ildene?"
54300,Well done. Again.
54301,Sold. She's all yours. She's already saddled up.
54303,"Maybe if we stopped singing about their silly Nord heroes, the rebels would stop making such a fuss!"
54305,I don't want to talk about it.
54306,There's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit in troubled times.
54308,Knowing a Word of Power is to take its meaning into yourself. 
54312,"So you meet me at Fallowstone Cave, and we'll get this over with. I can have my tribe back, and you can... You can leave us alone."
54316,...but what's this? These results... They're not at all what they should be.
54317,I guess you can have that.
54319,"I'm bored standing around, papa. I could take over for you..."
54320,"I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill."
54324,"When another person shows interest, and the two agree to be together, one of them comes to the Temple and we arrange a ceremony."
54325,"Thanks! Not sure it was necessary, though."
54336,Do you have business with the court?
54338,I'll send you to Oblivion!
54340,You're smarter than you look.
54344,It will... take more than that... to stop me...
54345,You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.
54349,Snow-Hammer.
54350,Dravin! One of the soldiers I spoke to on the way home said you threatened them. What's come over you?
54353,No idea. Maybe he got tired of getting stung by these damn bees.
54354,"Well, he is the mayor."
54356,No.
54359,The Gildergreen will bloom again. All thanks to you.
54360,You must bring her to us.
54362,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
54363,"That would be a fair price. When you've got it, come see me."
54364,A marriage of both love and political advantage. A rare thing indeed.
54367,"Your training proceeds well, Dragonborn."
54368,"Just arrive in the city? Is it true what they say, then? There are dragons about?"
54373,"Don't know why you'd help a stranger like that, but a septim's a septim... don't care where it comes from."
54375,"Well what are you going to do then, huh? Let's hear it!"
54376,"This council was your idea, eh? So tell us, what do you think Riften is worth?"
54379,"I guess I can look the other way, this time."
54381,If you say so.
54382,Most of my friends are buried here.
54383,What was it you wanted?
54385,"Keep your eyes open, they'll try to hit us again... I just know it."
54386,We will do your next test in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
54387,A healing spell? Are you a priest?
54394,He what?
54395,I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
54400,Perhaps only its creators ever knew it. But I am not the one to speak of it to you.
54403,Perhaps some more Glow Dust in the next batch of potions. That should increase their resistance.
54404,What brings you back to Nightingale Hall?
54407,Now shouldn't you be off arranging our wedding day? Don't keep me waiting.
54415,"Well, I do recall warning them it might not be the safest of locations. I hope this doesn't become a problem for us."
54416,"Its scent is foul, unclean. Hurtful."
54417,This is what it's come to. No one seems to care what they've done to our home.
54420,"I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you!"
54421,I hate them.
54422,That's my boy.
54426,I suppose you want something for your trouble? Here.
54427,"But now what? I can't just walk away. Not with my friends' bodies in there, being torn apart by those beasts."
54428,Be prepared to defend yourself.
54434,Did you need something? A staff? Some enchanting materials?
54435,"Started out with a single fishing pole and now I have an entire building and two boats to my name. Not bad for a middle-aged Nord, eh?"
54437,I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
54440,You did this didn't you? I'll get you for this!
54446,I told you you wouldn't like the news.
54448,Such a kind nibble you are.
54449,"Mara is the handmaiden of Kyne, the Goddess of the Storm and the Mother of Men."
54450,"We took you in, didn't we? We would be glad to extend our welcome to any other who showed your dedication. What more could we do?"
54451,"He was always a quiet lad, but lately... something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent."
54455,Alms? Alms for a veteran?
54459,"A bad dream I can handle, but everyone having the same bad dream, every night? It's a curse, I say."
54461,The old tales tell of Dragonborn heroes who slew dragons and took their power.
54465,Can you not hear me? Are your ears full of hate? 
54469,"Can you lead the way to where Shor's hall waits, beckoning us on to welcome long sought?"
54474,Orgnar.
54476,"My friend Dorthe doesn't like my pranking. ""You're being mean, Frodnar!"" So what if I am?"
54477,I wish I could play with fire like that.
54480,No one should ever be left to the Thalmor.
54485,<Laughter>
54490,I've certainly learned more here than I ever expected to.
54491,"Again, as one! The World-Eater fears us!"
54493,Gauldur!
54497,What're you lookin' at?
54498,You think I'm afraid of you?
54499,Be careful who you talk to.
54501,I understand you're the one that found this... Orb in Saarthal.
54506,"Now, I need to be alone."
54509,Need something?
54519,"So, perhaps you are not entirely useless... We shall soon find out."
54520,And you don't want to talk to Borkul the Beast.
54521,I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do.
54525,"Hopefully we can learn something from the experience. How the ancient Nords used magic, maybe even what happened to this place."
54531,Very well.
54532,"I swear, if I ever get out of here, I'm giving up thieving. Really."
54533,Grah...Dun!
54534,"There's not many people left in Winterhold, so I only have Assur to play with, and sometimes he's mean."
54535,"Well, at the first sign of battle I'll be comfortably sitting in my room, waiting for it to end, so don't you worry."
54537,I came home to Skyrim when it was all over. But I wasn't much good at anything other than fighting.
54542,"My son, Olur, learns the forge well. His work brings me pride."
54544,"Other prisoners get suspicious when we talk to each other, so keep it down."
54548,"If you're planning violence against me or mine, you'll regret it."
54549,"By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?"
54551,I served in the Great War against the Thalmor. I remember how bravely a Legionnaire can fight.
54553,"I thank you for this gift. The other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though. "
54555,"With the Elder Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to... cast yourself back. To the other end of the break."
54556,"As if this craggy, wretch of a city could give birth to a superiorly bred Mer such as myself. No, I'm not from Markarth."
54563,"My duty is simple - oversee the Thalmor Justiciars, and make sure they perform their duties admirably."
54565,Got no time for a Nord who thinks he's better than everyone else. Keep walking.
54566,"I have potions for disease, love sickness, irritating children..."
54567,"If you wish to stand alone, so be it. If you wish for our help, you'll answer my question."
54569,What? What trickery is this? You're not going anywhere until I find out what you're up to!
54570,Oof!
54571,"Like it or not, this College is a direct influence on the public's impressions of magic and those that use it."
54577,What do you say?
54578,"So, is it true?"
54579,"But if you mean me, now, in particular... maybe they've started to get an inkling of what the return of the dragons means."
54584,"Korir will be the first to tell you that if it weren't for that College, we'd all be better off. I agree with him."
54586,Azura bless you.
54588,"He seeks information about the Eye, but what he will find shall be quite different."
54589,Mind the way.
54591,"A life on the river makes for weak legs, so I do a lot of walking when we dock."
54593,We'd better stick together down here.
54594,Tell me something. Do you enjoy spending Lady Maven's gold for her? It certainly seems that way.
54595,"Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!"
54599,"I tell you? Saw that wild mare again yesterday, just outside the walls."
54600,Why can't the men in this city leave me alone?
54601,Don't be a fool.
54605,Thanks so much. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your time and effort.
54606,Excellent. These should come in handy.
54607,"Not too bad, I hope?"
54609,I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.
54611,Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?
54613,I don't remember seeing you at one of these before.
54616,You shouldn't play around with magic like that...
54619,You've ruined everything!
54620,They will hunt him while you delay. Your choice. 
54622,"Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way."
54625,Yep.
54626,It is so.
54627,Things are so much quieter with my darling Frabbi dead.
54633,"Nothing, nothing. Just straighten yourself out before you find yourself headed back to Black Marsh."
54645,Traitors. Traitors all of you!
54646,"Yes, that's right. Whether or not I'm interested depends on what you've got, of course."
54647,But the difficulty remains - how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at all?
54650,I haven't even said what it is.
54651,"They say a strong drink, a sharp axe and a good woman are all a Nord needs to be happy. Two out of three's not bad."
54653,"The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known."
54671,But you already have a traveling companion. I fear I would just get in the way.
54672,"No, no. Well, sometimes, but that's not the problem."
54676,"I'm kind of busy, but if you need any potions or ingredients, let me know."
54680,Please remain calm!
54685,It should be embarrassed to be uncovered so.
54686,I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker.
54688,Better to stay out of sight and ply my trade with the Thieves Guild than risk a contract on my head.
54691,"With any luck, this will be Mercer's final day alive."
54695,Hroggar blames his wife for spilling bear fat in the fire.
54696,Mul is the smart one. I go where he tells me.
54699,I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only.
54701,He is pleased. Ours is the strongest tribe in all the Reach.
54702,"They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. "
54703,That's it. Keep hacking at it.
54704,Don't make a mess of this.
54705,"Filthy Argonian never would have set foot in this city, if High King Torygg was still alive. I can tell you that."
54709,Make your way to our camp in Falkreath. We're going to take it back.
54718,"Oh Reyda! Redya! You live among the clouds now, dear Reyda!"
54723,"I'm not one to complain, but I'm not sure why Kraldar insists on keeping Malur Seloth around."
54725,"We're one of the same kind, you and I. I'm glad to have met you."
54726,Wealth is my business. Help me out and I can add to yours. Would you like a taste?
54728,Well? What's it going to be?
54731,Hooray!
54734,"I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me."
54735,"Can I buy you a drink, darling?"
54739,"No, don't bother. You're useless, as always. I'll get Ildene to do it."
54741,"Aye, now that's some fine armor. Good old-fashioned steel."
54742,"Aww, I'm hungry! Can we get some food, instead?"
54743,"With this terrible war, I'm a bit overwhelmed. As are the catacombs."
54744,"Once you find the courier's route, kill him and take his place."
54745,"Every year, I sell more Honningbrew and Maven loses customers. Know why? My mead tastes better."
54755,Die!
54757,I'm surprised you succeeded. Please accept this as payment.
54758,My son? Erik? What about him? Did something happen? Is he alright?
54761,Ten more would keep me stocked for a bit.
54764,"You're learning, Dragonborn. Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult."
54768,Kill him.
54770,"The men here like my attention, and I like theirs. Best know your place."
54771,"But remember, you're still oathbound to our cause. Skyrim still waits to be free."
54773,"If you desire to fight me, then let's get this over with."
54774,But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College.
54775,You aren't making any sense. Hand what over?
54779,Is that confidence I hear... or is it arrogance? Strange how often they're confused.
54780,That is true. Perhaps I should be more grateful for this opportunity. Not many Khajiit can say that they have visited Skyrim.
54781,Glory only awaits those who triumph. 
54784,"Please, ma'am, I've got nowhere to go..."
54789,"Despite the shame, this one can't help but stare."
54793,"Knowledge is power. Knowing spells can be powerful, but applying that knowledge is key."
54797,"Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons."
54798,It's true. For as long as I can remember our crops have always done well.
54799,You aren't the first one to have gotten this far. You won't be the last.
54801,"We won't give up this port to the Imperials without a fight, don't you worry."
54802,Now you're going to pay!
54804,"I do what I can to see that Idgrod's time isn't wasted, and that she only has to deal with important matters."
54806,"Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already... Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be avoided."
54807,"Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?"
54809,So you made it out. Good for you. Don't expect me to thank you. I still remember what you did to me.
54810,"My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do."
54812,"If one of my enemies wouldn't pay to have me killed, I'd take it as a personal insult."
54813,"It's for sale, if you've got the coin."
54815,Sit back and enjoy the ride.
54820, 
54821,"What? Who are you? Oh, never mind. Cut me down before that thing gets us!"
54822,I... knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends.
54825,"Whenever a group of marauders attack a Nord village, Ulfric is the first to sound the horn and send the men."
54828,"You'll defeat Ancano, won't you?"
54829,"But, you took care of him and the giants. Two problems solved at once."
54833,"So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me."
54834,Don't cause any trouble.
54837,"The Augur? Tragic story, really. At least, the way I heard it. But that was a long time ago."
54838,Whatever you've heard I can do is probably true.
54839,"When you find your nerves, then we'll talk."
54840,"As the Jarl of Riften, I feel it's my duty to honor your selfless behavior by honoring you with the title Thane of Riften."
54843,We're at war with Leigelf? Isn't he your husband?
54845,Yeagh!
54847,"Surrender or die, outlander!"
54848,"Ah, splendid! Our fine city has a proud history, and I'm happy to share what I know."
54849,You've embarrassed the temple and spat in the face of love. What do you want?
54856,Come on! Let's go.
54857,Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.
54859,"No, no. You just stay here and rest."
54865,"I was a beauty in my day, dearie. Don't act so surprised."
54869,Following.
54870,I can't wait to see what's inside!
54872,"Maybe to you, but he's just so... his story is..."
54875,I hear you faced a dragon at Helgen and lived to tell about it. That ain't nothing.
54878,Yeah!
54879,"Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person."
54880,I've never held a knitting needle. 
54888,"I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure what he expects me to tell you."
54893,"Indeed. Orin brit ro. I cannot leave here until you defeat Alduin, which you cannot do without my help."
54894,"I'm spoken for, you know. So don't get any ideas. "
54898,There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!
54899,I was meant for so much more than all of this... I wish to pledge my life and ply my talents in darker circles.
54901,"Well, soldier? Can you do this?"
54905,"You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What did he want?"
54907,I have meals to cook for the entire castle and almost no help.
54911,It... it worked. Mara be praised!
54915,See? I even have a little potion for the Steward. Mind handing it over to him? Just say it should solve that problem he has.
54921,"Drinks here are watered down, but they're cheap."
54926,"On the other hand, the Thalmor have considerable funds and are looking to expand their shipping."
54927,"Oh, I'm sorry to keep you. Head right in. "
54934,"I'll get it right this time, I swear."
54937,But never mind all that. What brings you out this way?
54938,"I'm a busy man. Half this city works for my family, and I have to keep them in line."
54941,That's what happens when you cross the Guild.
54942,"Of course, of course. But such things are valuable, and usually falling apart anyway."
54943,No problem.
54944,I can't agree to any peace council until I know Tullius will be there. The other Jarls could take that as a sign of weakness.
54945,Hm? Something's near...
54946,You sure? Fine. I'll stand watch.
54951,"Remember, this is between us now."
54956,Make your choice. Make your kill. I just want to observe... and admire.
54957,Oh no! By the gods! This can't be happening!
54958,"I can only hammer so fast, Gerdur."
54959,We must be prepared to face them.
54966,Despite what you discovered it's still comforting to know my husband is at peace.
54967,"Besides, you look like your pockets are a little light on coin, am I right?"
54969,"Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel would call us Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel."
54970,Few can resist my charms. Even fewer are worthy of them.
54972,Lady Mara... preserve me...
54977,"I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than fight for the people of Skyrim?"
54980,Please don't do anything to anger the locals. They don't need additional reasons to hate us.
54984,Out of the way!
54985,"Whatever, just get it done. Here's the job."
54986,"Oh dear, I hadn't thought of that."
54993,The general expects so much with so little.
54994,"We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?"
54995,My sister in crime. What'd you need?
54997,"Let's get going, then."
55000,The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.
55003,If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...
55004,"Faas nu, zini dein ruthi ahst vaal."
55005,Kill well. And often.
55006,It doesn't matter. It's also none of your concern.
55008,"Finally, my leadership is being recognized."
55010,"The selection seems small, but we can provide whatever you need. Just ask."
55016,"Go on, get out of here."
55017,You fighter types are always underfoot. You want me to clean? Then scat!
55020,"I did, and I will. It's just tougher than I thought."
55024,"The Dreth family doesn't steal, Indaryn."
55026,"It ain't so bad. I miss living with my parents back in Helgen, though. Froki can't cook and there's nobody to talk to up here."
55032,Dead? Oh my goodness!
55033,Just... try and keep out of our way.
55034,Got lots of things to take care of. What do you need?
55036,"Lilija joined the Stormcloaks many years ago, when the first of the skirmishes broke out across Skyrim. I was so proud of her."
55037,Now that's the true Voice!
55039,Oh dear.
55040,I work in the mines. I hunt. Everything else I do is my business.
55047,"If it's arms or armor you need, see Beirand in Castle Dour. Bloody good blacksmith, that one."
55049,Where did you keep all that loot?  I've been here almost a year and haven't seen any of it.
55053,"It's been an honor to serve you, brother."
55054,"Yes, Listener. I'll return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary without delay."
55060,You can't be too careful. Thalmor spies are everywhere.
55068,He calls out in his sleep sometimes. I've heard Falion's name. What does it mean?
55072,The Forsworn haven't been kind to Karthwasten. I've heard rumors that they've attacked this place without mercy.
55076,These tools were found in a crypt outside Windhelm. They belonged to the ancient Nords who dwelt in Skyrim before the days of the First Empire.
55077,"Wonderful! Remarkably well-preserved, too."
55078,"Your daughters are growing up fast, Lemkil. Seems like only yesterday they were newborn babes."
55079,"I never would have thought, but Uglarz is an even better hunter than Yatul was. The things I'm learning now..."
55083,Strong gauntlets for strong hands.
55084,"Oh, gods, please! Let me live! I'll do anything you want!"
55086,"The walls have ears and you're being tested, lass. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon."
55090,"I don't abide fancy clothes, but you look like you might. I hear Radiant Raiments has a large selection."
55092,"Now you just stay here, with all your friends, and I'm going to go get my shovel."
55093,"The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!"
55096,What?
55097,"What? Oh, nothing. All is well."
55101,"It's not easy being a woman in Skyrim, I know. But stay strong, and men will come to respect you, and maybe even fear you."
55109,A citizen of Hjaalmarch has been kidnapped.
55110,I'll carve you into pieces!
55114,"No, but then I don't have much need for Ulfric."
55115,I've never seen you before. Leave me alone!
55116,So you're the one who's been down there killing all my wolves. You're gonna die for that!
55118,We are not warriors. What is overlooked in the Dragonborn is not permitted to any other followers of the Way of the Voice.
55120,We're getting back to work as best we can.
55128,These Stormcloaks are ridiculous. They won't shop here because they think I'll sell them poisoned tonics. I should just go back to Cyrodiil.
55131,Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.
55133,"I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor. Who you also serve, technically."
55135,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle right here in Whiterun Hold.
55138,I'll spit on your corpse!
55139,Now here's a man I'm glad to see.
55141,He's written all of the text in the Falmer language.
55144,Damn you!
55146,"He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can name him!"
55149,"What an amazing city. I've actually never managed to visit Whiterun, but I always wanted to."
55151,Get the crown already. We don't need to hang around here any longer than necessary.
55152,That doesn't matter. All it would take is a stray wolf or a bandit crossing your path... I can't bare to lose you after everything we've done.
55153,"How do you think the crops are coming, dear?"
55155,You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation.
55158,I'm just here to mine.
55160,You're headed to Dawnstar.
55161,I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian couldn't find his tail with both hands.
55162,I ain't much for talkin'.
55171,"It's good to see you again, dear."
55173,The Arcanaeum is always accepting new volumes. I'll take what I can get.
55175,We're looking for someone. Maybe you can help. 
55176,"The rest you can find out by asking the townsfolk. I'd start with the barkeep at the Bannered Mare, or the castle steward."
55177,Skyrim has no use for your kind.
55178,"Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you."
55182,"Talos was a heroic man, but not a god. It pains the Altmer that we must remind our younger cousins of the difference."
55185,"If you can find me first, I can tell you."
55190,What's he rummaging around in there for?
55191,Even we who ride the currents of Time cannot see past Time's end. Wuldsetiid los tahrodiis.
55193,"I'm fine, father. Work is fine."
55194,"No, I'm sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else. I've never even heard that name before."
55195,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
55197,Kill the vampire!
55199,Spiced Wine to warm the blood!
55202,Unslaad Krosis!
55203,"This is my final contract, and certainly the most challenging. Be careful with this one, my friend."
55206,"So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his face apart so he can leave me alone."
55209,"Well ain't that the truth of it. All right, then. Let's see what you've got!"
55210,"Mind you don't get fresh with Susanna. She plays the flirt, but it's just to get good tips."
55211,"A moment, please."
55213,Ha. Sure you did. Dagur put you up to this?
55215,I'm just here to dig. Not much else to talk about.
55217,"So you can spend it on drinks at the Bannered Mare? If it's food you need, ask for that instead."
55218,You start flapping that jaw of yours or I'll start flapping it for you. You understand me?
55219,"Our men know how to kill Forsworn and Legionnaires, not dragons."
55226,"Sithis' whisper be upon you, brother."
55227,"Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am, therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a being's inevitable end."
55230,Closest town from here is Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he'd help you out.
55235,But what's all this about? What are you two doing here?
55240,Off with ya then. I've got work to do.
55241,I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim.
55242,"Why do the Nords bother you so much, Ambarys?"
55243,Can't wait to kill another Imperial.
55244,I served in the Legion with Thongvor Silver-Blood. He's a good man and a tough soldier.
55245,"If you bring mead, you're welcome here! Even if you don't, you're still welcome!"
55246,I'm warning you. Back off!
55247,Yamarz was a fool. Always trying to scheme his way out of responsibility.
55248,You. You should just go. I don't have enough ale to stomach talking to you.
55249,Thank you. I'll be waiting for that bottle.
55254,"Use both Fus and Ro. Together, they will make the Shout more powerful."
55256,You go speak with Muiri. I've got to deal with the Night Mother and her little... clown.
55257,And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus?
55259,I guess we'd better try this way.
55267,"When Aventus took off, when he said those things, about killing Grelod... I never imagined he was serious..."
55269,"Congratulations, brother. You've been living in Skyrim so long, you've become a Nord."
55271,"You can stay, but you're not supposed to be here."
55273,"Just bring any of them, lad! Can't risk thirsty customers without mead to drink, even for a second!"
55275,"Please to meet you, I'm a priestess at the Temple of Mara."
55276,"I'm having fun, are you?"
55278,Why are you standing here then?
55281,"You are ready to move, yes?"
55282,Is that the best you can do?
55286,Very funny.
55288,I hear Mauhulakh is wandering again. He's after a new woman.
55289,"But now, because of Ulfric's greed, countless lives have been lost."
55290,"Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able."
55299,We consider even sitting down to talk with these rebels more than generous.
55301,"She's trying to undermine my confidence, make me doubt myself. Well it won't work, I tell you!"
55302,Good day to you.
55303,"We fight to make our land great once more, to raise up strong, noble thanes, and lay low false Jarls and the cowards who hide behind them."
55305,My husband handles the indoor work. Just as well - he'd only hurt himself out here.
55310,"You are traitors and will die traitors' deaths. Stand down and face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by my hands."
55311,"I made a wish in the town well that a golden knight came to take me to his castle. Oh, does it spoil the wish if I tell?"
55312,"The fool's my husband. I'm Fjola - or I was, once. Don't you see?"
55317,Su...
55318,That is correct. Those orders have been delivered by special courier. I can't trust some of our normal distribution channels.
55319,You're too slow. I saw it first.
55321,The Jarl would be wise to remember that it is her thanes - and my profits - that are paying for this war.
55326,What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!
55330,You'll pay off your debt to the Reach. Just work and you'll earn your freedom.
55333,Is that all you've got?
55338,"Winterhold was once the capital of Skyrim, you know. Quite an honor."
55339,"Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over."
55342,"Get it over with, then."
55349,Don't mind me. I'm just running errands for the old man.
55352,"Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything."
55356,Let's see what you've got!
55357,Guide my light through the temple to open the inner sanctum and destroy the defiler.
55358,Like I said. It got hot and smoky. Now it's cold and quiet.
55360,According to legend. Although I never thought to put the tale to the test.
55361,Pardon me.
55362,You shouldn't leave Solitude without trying our fish. Best in Skyrim.
55363,"Stick with me, and they'll never even know you're there."
55365,Sleep.
55368,"As high priest of the Eight Divines, I bid you welcome."
55369,Well guess who really runs things around here? Me. I own the mines. I make the coin pass to the right hands.
55373,I still need you to make a batch of those fried potatoes. We can serve them with the ale.
55374,Is it not allowed?
55379,Sometimes I'm not certain that the people of Riften want to be helped.
55382,"One of the guards from Dragonsreach came to me, worried about a prisoner who's escaped."
55387,Is there... something else you need?
55390,Mother's calling me. It's time for me to sleep now. I'm so tired. Thank you for making her feel better.
55392,I used to visit him from time to time. Nearly crazed by loneliness and captivity. Tiiraz sivaas. He did not even remember his own name.
55396,Then allow me to introduce myself.
55398,"Saadia, wake up dear!"
55402,We are strong. We get the job done.
55403,Look to the graveyard. That is where you'll find her.
55409,"M'aiq is always in search of calipers, yet finds none. Where could they have gone?"
55412,This wasn't what I wanted. Not at all.
55414,"Oh, don't listen to her. We can do it, just give us a chance!"
55417,Nightmares. I haven't met a single man or woman who doesn't admit to having them.
55418,"Come on, I'll explain on the way."
55423,"By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a business deal."
55424,"Hmmm... Well, maybe we could go on a sort of trip. Take the wares on the road. Get some new customers."
55425,J'zargo understands. You hesitate because you know J'zargo will be better than you. Very well.
55426,He was cruel to her. He would beat her every night.
55427,I will entreat Mara on your behalf.
55429,Who knows. The cat was crazy. She was a fool to trust him.
55435,You've returned! I'm hoping successfully.
55437,"Fortune smiles on us. Here's your share, love."
55439,Good hunting. I'll see you back at the Sanctuary.
55440,Talk to my parents if you need something.
55442,I figured that I would run the mine someday. I just didn't figure that would mean now.
55447,I will not surrender Markarth without raising my own sword in her defense.
55453,"Bah. If there was a tonic that could help me, I would have found it by now..."
55455,The prophecies are clear. Only the Dragonborn can stop Alduin.
55460,Yes!
55461,"Thank you. Take it to Quintus, in the White Phial."
55463,"You know, I ought to retire and leave you to run the Skeever, son!"
55464,Let me know if you need something forged.
55465,"I would need to challenge the chief, and take his head, to return home. I'd rather stay here."
55466,And they say romance is dead.
55468,"It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it! "
55471,You left this over there. You're lucky - someone else might have kept it for himself. Here you go.
55472,"I'm sorry, Aduri, not this year. Perhaps next year after the harvest, I don't know. There's so much to do."
55476,"No, not until the Moot meets to choose another. And it won't meet until one side or the other wins the war."
55477,"They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself."
55479,"You could say the Ratway is the city under the city. Dark, dangerous, and no place for decent folk."
55484,Why don't you go in there and get it?
55489,No? So you don't know anything about my brother?
55496,We summon Potema!
55498,"Good, good. It'll be worth it, I assure you."
55501,And here's the spoils. Plenty more where this came from!
55502,"Anyway, after I got back to the Guild, I decided to start calling myself Twice-Killed."
55503,Morthal has enough problems as it is!
55504,This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.
55505,My family were in the Mythic Dawn. My museum is our legacy.
55509,Animals in the Pale don't need a reason to attack Dawnstar. It's just their nature.
55511,You have a problem with that? Go talk to him. You'll find him in front of the ruins during the day. Just down the tunnel.
55514,Sigh.
55516,"After we discovered what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just vanished."
55518,"Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll have more information soon."
55521,Black Briar Mead? What are you trying to do? Poison me?
55524,Don't you understand the danger? Don't you understand what the return of the dragons means?
55530,"He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day."
55531,"Hmm. This is intriguing, but highly disturbing."
55533,"What is it Ulfric's always saying... ""On my honor as a Nord, I swear it."" (Laughter)."
55540,"It was some experiment gone horribly wrong. Ghastly results, I was told. And his ghost still roams the halls, they say."
55542,I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others.
55543,You were just going to prove that you're Dragonborn.
55545,Ivarstead? So close to Riften? She's an even bigger fool than I thought.
55549,"A little boy, Aventus Aretino, got sent to the orphanage. Now there's talk he's trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. No good can come of that..."
55556,"Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for family."
55559,I won't be myself for some time. I just need to get out of here and recover.
55560,Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.
55561,You assaulted one of my family members. I've come to accept your apology.
55562,We will endure. We always have.
55563,"I've just been asked enough questions. I'm here to learn, not to explain myself over and over."
55564,You stay away from my family. Or you die. Be smart. Stay away.
55566,Get out of my sight!
55567,This should come in handy. Here. Let me show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.
55569,(Whimpering)
55571,"He's just a little confused at the moment, is all. Knowing my master, he may very well reward you for bringing him to his senses!"
55573,I wonder what the ancient nords used this place for?
55575,Out with it. Time is money.
55576,"I can take a hint, lad. You want to make some coin, come find me."
55577,"My poor Fralia thinks Thorald's still alive, but I know better."
55578,"The Stormcloaks were forced to retake the Reach on our own, but that taste of independence emboldened them. And the Forsworn were born."
55581,"Vvardenfell's Red Mountain erupts. Try to be precise, Jorn."
55584,"I know where this is going, son. As I've said many a time. the world is a dangerous place. You're much safer here at the farm, with me."
55588,Gallus trusted her too much and let her get too close.
55590,"Pay dear old Sarthis a visit and tell him Maven sends her regards, would you?"
55597,"What the rebels like to forget, is that the Empire's what's keeping the Dominion out of Skyrim."
55599,"Here, please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude."
55604,Wait. Something's happening... gods above!
55606,"My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall."
55608,"Eehhh... no. Sorry. But I did notice that her coinpurse was still intact, so whoever did this wasn't after gold."
55610,"Can't prove it. But I could use your help, being unbiased and all."
55614,The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here.
55615,"Oooh... So silent. So menacing. A true assassin of the old way. Cicero likes you. Oh yes, Cicero likes you, indeed."
55616,"If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him for the kill."
55617,Come on. Show me you've got what it takes!
55620,"Have to admit, I'm attached to the place. Suppose that makes me crazy, doesn't it?"
55622,"That's all there is to it, Dragonborn. Good luck."
55623,Not really sure what to do with myself anymore. I just miss her so much.
55626,What do you want? Have digging to do.
55631,"You were young when you first tasted human flesh, weren't you? A brother or sister had died? An accident, of course."
55633,That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores.
55635,What's the matter with you? You think you can just go dropping your junk wherever you like?
55639,Have you made a decision about Falion?
55642,"Through the Protocol, we have seen the home of the next Sybil, to the north, in a small village pressed against the stone."
55646,"Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm going to tend to Nurelion. I can make his final days a bit less painful. "
55647,"Shor's blood, the Thu'um!"
55648,"I'm as much a Nord as the next man, but I'm no fool. I don't live in the past, like those Gray-Manes."
55649,It is not the place of the College to become involved in local politics.
55652,Can't believe I'm posted here. Even the beds are made of stone.
55655,I really don't want to fight.
55658,Let's just get this over with.
55659,"Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!"
55660,Iiz!
55661,"Even the Greybeards must bend to the winds of change, it seems."
55662,"It is through the ebb and flow of this cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace."
55663,Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery West as soon as possible. That was Maven's part of the deal.
55664,"Hey, be careful!"
55666,The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.
55670,"I oversee Markarth Smelter. Worker gets out of line, I get him back in line."
55673,"I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand."
55677,A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?
55679,"There are some experiments the College frowns on. If they're aware of them, of course."
55680,"There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill."
55682,"The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!"
55683,Your end draws near!
55685,Get over to Markarth. We're mounting our final attack!
55686,"You can try, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly."
55689,Don't run. Stay for dinner!
55691,I've been chronicling the recent history of the Blades. What would you like your entry to say?
55692,You like creepin' around in the shadows? Magic'll work just as good there as anywhere else.
55697,"Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!"
55698,"Oh, and please, take this as payment. It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!"
55699,Need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
55708,"That may be what you are here for, Dragonborn."
55713,My daughter is the one who needs your pity. I'm just a poor Forsworn whose only regret is not killing more Nords before I was locked up.
55714,You've broken the Code of Malacath. Your choice - pay with your blood or your gold.
55721,"Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities to ""acquire"" things from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty, now can we?"
55722,I've been waiting for you. Hjalti.
55724,"I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it."
55729,Talos guide you.
55731,"Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. Congratulations."
55739,"Markarth remains allied to the Empire, under the authority of Jarl Igmund."
55741,If only we'd stayed out of Saarthal.
55742,Welcome back! Good to see you again.
55743,"I'm not as skilled as Curalmil, so I'm afraid it will only ever refill with one type of liquid."
55751,"The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that."
55756,"So you see, I have to return it. It breaks tradition, and I need to tell him that I finally did what he wanted."
55761,What manner of staff is that? Such a horror...
55763,Ugh. That armor stinks of death. You been grave robbing?
55769,"Fine, I won't fire him, but I'm doing this for your sake. Not his."
55773,"So what do you think about it all, then?"
55775,You come talking to me wearing Imperial armor? You got stew for brains?
55776,Last person who made trouble for Vekel ended up with a smashed head.
55777,"You will enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty blade."
55779,"I run the mill, so I'm a busy woman. What is it?"
55786,"Yes, what about Jarl Erikur?"
55788,"If we killed a dragon once, we can do it again. With your help, of course."
55790,That's great. I owe you one. Thanks!
55792,Got a minute? Wanted to say something.
55796,"Thank Kynareth for you, stranger. I'd almost given up hope of walking away from here."
55797,There's no time! You have to get back to the College as fast as you can!
55798,"By Ysmir, you've helped save the Gildergreen. Words can't express what that means to this city."
55800,"Oh, dear. Would you look at that? How embarrassing."
55801,I can always find time to share a word with a warrior.
55803,"Oh, you know. Little Kjeld is a handful, and Froa is just so quiet. "
55805,I suggest you mind your own business and return to whatever it is you do here.
55807,"Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come here?"
55809,"Have you by chance heard of the ""Gourmet""? Read his cookbook? It's become quite a phenomenon."
55810,"Markarth's a different place, now. Do business here, and you do business with the Thieves Guild."
55814,"All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him... and now that we hear rumors about the dragons, he's been very depressed."
55815,Unfortunate. Let's be more careful next time. 
55817,"You didn't hear this from me, but we've uncovered a plot to kill the Emperor! It gets better. The ringleader? One of the Emperor's own elite guard..."
55818,"As you venture, Mara fills my mind ever more with visions of love in peril."
55819,"Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales..."
55820,Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.
55823,There's a dragon. Here. In Dragonsreach. And I thought it was just a name.
55827,"He's just a guard captain. And not a very good one, at that."
55830,"Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there will be gold... a fortune in gold. But so much more!"
55831,Almost there! We're so close!
55834,"It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years."
55835,"Well why do I have to listen to Skjor, then?"
55841,"My name may not be on the label, but some of my blood, sweat and tears are in every drop. Uh, figuratively of course."
55842,Come to gawk at the Dark Elf?
55843,We want compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
55845,"Hmm, yes. But your su'um is strong. I do not doubt that you can convince him of the need."
55847,Joric's sister? Poor child. Magic runs deep in that family's bloodline. It's not always a blessing.
55854,What made you think I was to blame in the first place? I've actually been after the killer myself.
55856,"Look, I've told you everything. Now leave me alone!"
55860,"My bloodin' days might be over, but my son Idolaf is out there fightin' for Skyrim! Fightin' for the Empire! Ha!"
55861,Are we clear?
55862,I have a saying - I'm not going to feel what you have to like. Or something like that. 
55864,"If you do this, if you kill the Emperor... Oh, how the masses will fear and respect you."
55867,You're going to have to sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the strongbox.
55868,But I swear upon Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any harm from befalling you.
55869,We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away this great gift we've been granted.
55871,What does a fellow need to do to get a drink around here?
55872,"I've heard you Gray-Manes are collaborating with the Stormcloaks. If I see any such treachery, I'll deal with you myself."
55873,"Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lad."
55877,We want compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
55880,"Well, my friend... the time's come to make it official. It's time to become our Guild Master."
55883,What is the music of life?
55890,Hold a moment. This is more than a simple prison break. I want to have Arn's name stricken from the record books permanently.
55896,The Stormcloaks are content to live in the past forever. No wonder the Provincials think we're all baseless savages.
55897,Wanderer like you must have plenty of tales to tell. But I'm afraid I'm too busy to hear 'em.
55898, 
55901,"I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk..."
55902,I told you I don't like you going there. I've seen scavengers picking at the mammoths. They could be dangerous.
55903,"I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with, but I can assure you that personal wealth is our lowest priority."
55905,Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.
55913,I think I saw it again. That... ghost. It was over by the barrows.
55914,"Return with the gauntlets, or not at all."
55921,"Volunruud? Well, that is interesting. I know this place..."
55922,I'll meet you outside!
55927,Wanderer like you needs a little fire in the veins. Some spiced wine?
55928,"No offense intended, but I don't think we have anything to talk about."
55931,"There was love between our families. For generations. Now, there is only enmity."
55934,I won't forget. I'll do it after I get the dishes cleaned.
55936,"Well, you're certainly making a name for yourself."
55938,This can't be happening!
55940,"Go to Malacath's shrine, southeast of Largashbur. See if perhaps he will aid us after all."
55943,"I said shut up, scum!"
55944,"I'm not seeing things again, am I?"
55945,Well? Is everything out there all right?
55946,"Hin aar, orin nu. And yet here I am, still your prisoner."
55949,"Ysmir's beard, you're right! No fish was ever caught by staying away from the shore. I'm off to see her!"
55950,"Whatever the truth, if Ulfric get's his hands on it, it would be a powerful symbol around which to rally support for his cause."
55954,What are we going to do? How do we save the College?
55955,You're a real fighter. I like that.
55956,"Yes, I hope this helps."
55957,"Oh. Well, if you change your mind, let me know."
55960,She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then...
55961,Azura is watching over you. She has seen this before it ever happened.
55964,That'll teach you to cross me.
55965,"Ah, I was beginning to think the day would never come. So you broke the binding spell, did you? Matters little."
55966, 
55967,"Any aspiring mage would do well to look for the College in Winterhold. Head there, and you'll get what you're after."
55969,"Keep following, it isn't far."
55970,The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
55972,"Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away."
55976,"Do you ever get tired of the long days on the farm, Mathias?"
55977,I do!
55979,Okay. Just this once.
55982,I was there only for a short time. Much of what I have learned has been on my own. And I will teach you. You have no reason to go there.
55983,I'll not go down without a fight!
55984,"If Torygg couldn't defend his throne, he had no business being High King."
55985,We hold each other close and hope that all of this ends well.
55990,For Lady Mara!
55993,"Bless you, Lady of Shadows... I live another day."
55995,"See, there you go. Getting involved. Don't ask too many questions in Markarth. Safer for everyone that way."
55998,"Let me show you the operation, then you can ask your questions."
56002,"I truly hope that these points actually sink in, and that more care and thought is given to this subject in the future. Thank you."
56004,Let me just drop everything to help you. I don't mind. Really.
56005,"Everything's in order. Welcome back, sir."
56006,"Everyone said it had run out, but I smashed down one wall and found the widest veins of ebony I'd ever seen."
56008,"But you're probably more interested in Jorrvaskr, mead hall of the Companions. Their deeds of war and valor are... legendary."
56012,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
56015,That's what I keep telling myself.
56017,"If you've got the coin, you're welcome here. Otherwise, hit the road."
56018,No. That was an ugly affair. High King Torygg's death has turned the whole town on its head.
56024,"And there is still much of Skyrim I wish to see. I hear there is a city, Wind-Helm, that is nearly white with... What do you call it? Ah yes! Snow."
56026,"If you're here about the mine -- it's already got an owner, and she's not selling. If not, then please stay out of my workers' way."
56028,"Set an ambush along the road between, or camp by one of the inns."
56031,"This is Markarth, traveler. Safest city in the Reach."
56033,You're one of Namira's faithful now.
56034,"""Fade"" in your tongue. Mortals have greater affinity for this Word than the dov. Everything mortal fades away in time, but the spirit remains."
56037,Follow me. I think I can convince the tree to help us. 
56038,"I'm trying something new, offering discounts for bulk purchases. So far, that seems to be working."
56039,Well? In you go.
56040,Sometimes I just need to remind everyone why I'm the one in charge.
56044,I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?
56045,Thanks for convincing Elisif to put this on again.
56050,It's done. No more... no more talking about it.
56052,I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war? Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.
56058,"If you fancy keeping your purse filled with gold and your head on your shoulders, I'd stay out of those awful tunnels."
56060,Why doesn't someone do something?
56061,"Speak with the Indolent Farmer at the Vilemyr Inn, in Ivarstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
56063,Because it's always true.
56065,Brynjolf finally got some dirt on the mark and the evidence to back it up. Think you can give him a hand?
56067,I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable.
56072,Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Imperials and join forces for just a little while take care of some of these dragons?
56075,"Come, come. I haven't got all day."
56077,Pretty quiet out here on the farm. My wife and I kind of like the solitude.
56078,"Finally. I got stuff to do, ya know."
56079,Everyone says Eorlund Gray-Mane is the best smith in Skyrim. I plan to change a few minds about that.
56081,"You have piqued my curiosity, however. Please, do continue."
56083,I don't like doing business with Azura's faithful. Make it quick.
56084,"That is true, yes."
56085,I... I need time to think about all this. Go see Nazir - do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter further.
56086,Snow-Hammer.
56088,Now you're one of us.
56090,Oh... what happened?
56091,I can't stand those braggart Battle-Borns. They think they're the gods' gift to Whiterun.
56092,My friend! A toast to a beautiful friendship!
56093,The College has had enough trouble staying out of the war. No need to make it worse.
56094,"Strange house, but strong. Solid. I think I'll open a store. A task to tend to whenever you're away."
56095,Are you kidding? I've wanted to be with them since I was a little girl.
56098,"We bring you here to make you stronger, new blood. Now let's move."
56102,"Azura? Gods, it's all finally coming back to haunt me."
56104,"In fact, he's the reason I chose to learn the smithing trade. I want to make weapons and armor for the great Stormcloak army."
56106,Get over to Markarth.
56109,"I'll forge you a weapon tomorrow. Right now, I'm closed."
56110,Aye.
56113,"Mercer is being Mercer. If he has a plan to get us out of this rut, then he isn't sharing it with me."
56114,I'm staying out of this.
56116,"Good. No killing, though. Don't get arrested. I won't help you."
56118,I'll show you what a real Orc can do!
56119,I got something for you. But you'll have to come and get it.
56124,"Twice I've been robbed, and good luck getting any kind of justice from Vignar now that he's the Jarl. He probably told the Stormcloaks to do it."
56125,"Arcturus took some men deeper in, wanted to be sure. We should maybe... assist them."
56127,"Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!"
56133,"You're right. They always get what they want, somehow. Fine. Tell Atar I'll sell."
56136,"Also trampled on the sacred name of Talos, and gave the Thalmor free reign to stamp out Talos worship throughout the Empire."
56140,I said get out! I'm not paying a single coin!
56142,Hear that?
56143,"When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat."
56145,"I just can't seem to tear myself away. Whatever this is, its beauty is like nothing I've ever seen before."
56148,"In fact, they didn't seem to care much for anyone who wasn't a Nord."
56149,"Well, the Stormcloak guards drink a lot more than the Imperials did, so I've been making more money lately."
56151,Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company Warehouse. He helps maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of Solitude.
56154,I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.
56156,Don't screw this up.
56158,"Here, let me show you how an Orc learns to smith."
56159,That's fine.
56161,"The only mistake was you showing your face. You've committed crimes against Skyrim and her people, and it's time to face the Jarl's justice."
56162,You... you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?
56164,"Most of our weapons were crafted by Adrianne Avenicci. My woman's an artist, is what she is."
56168,"You see, here he is falling from the sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him."
56169,Keep your eyes open.
56174,"One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief."
56178,"Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok."
56188,"The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved, they'll know who is."
56189,"They say the Emperors used to be Dragonborn, but that all ended when Martin died during the Oblivion Crisis."
56190,"With the dragons returning, and now a Dragonborn appearing... maybe the Greybeards know what it all means."
56191,Need a trained war dog? Fiercest companion money can buy.
56196,"Are you a member of the College, or did you just steal those robes from a real wizard?"
56197,"I get the message. Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!"
56198,Horses. All day long. Do you have any idea how dull horses are?
56201,"No! Tell me you're joking. Sweet Mara, what have I done? Go away. Just go away."
56202,Our ancestors should be allowed to rest in peace.
56205,I have my own expenses you know...
56207,Look here. There's something strange about this cabinet.
56208,Don't start swinging that thing in here.
56209,"Damn it, woman, are you trying to taunt us? "
56210,"Really, the nerve of some people, leaving their trash wherever they please."
56213,"A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice."
56215,Why don't you stay a while?
56216,My cousin died. Things won't be the same without him.
56219,"My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me."
56223,I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for a while now.
56225,"It's the capital of Whiterun Hold, the biggest and the best of the nine holds of Skyrim. But don't take my word for it."
56227,Honored Companion. How can I assist you?
56230,How goes the investigation?
56231,"The Empire already took my daughter from us, but by Talos they will not take our homeland!"
56233,I need you to create some chaos in the hold.
56234,Praefect.
56235,Yeagh!
56239,"We stopped in Helgen this morning, and I thought it was all over. Had us lined up to the headsman's block and ready to start chopping."
56243,Damn it. No going back that way.
56245,Ha ha ha ha ha.
56248,"Kill me or don't, Listener! The power is yours! But spare poor Cicero, and a friend you will have! Oh, such a friend, until we enter the Void..."
56249,I found the bone! I've brought it to you but still I am refused...
56250,What do you think? Are we going to let Ulfric dictate terms to us before the negotiations even start?
56251,Happy hunting.
56255,You know what needs to be done. Is there something more you need?
56257,"Working hard gives a man reason for drinking hard! Well, that and putting up with a wife like mine."
56259,"Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks."
56260,"Yes, yes I did. I've already sent instructions, you just need to make sure this arrives in one piece."
56263,Take it.
56264,"What do you want, little elf?"
56266,"Can you believe we're here? Saarthal, of all places."
56269,"Bring me another seven of them, if you can."
56270,"If we can just find out what Shout the ancient Nords used, you may have a chance."
56271,Umm... yeah.
56275,"You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land."
56278,"I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my father is starting to suspect something."
56279,"You show promise. Remain focused, and you will fulfill your potential."
56281,Well hello.
56285,We're on the right track. She's been through here as well.
56286,"Oh, you're back? I suppose you'll be wanting your pay then."
56287,Here you go. Hope you don't muck it up.
56289,Let's keep moving.
56294,Lady Ateia says my voice is second only to hers. But she's selling me short.
56296,"I'm busy right now, lad. We can talk later."
56297,We couldn't have done this without you. The Empire glories in your accomplishments...
56298,"Lucan, we don't sell silver buckles, do we? One of the customers was asking."
56306,Not until the Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.
56311,But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King.
56315,Let's get going.
56317,"I'm the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city."
56321,"Nothing anybody I know would wear. Maybe ask one of the Dark Elves, they usually have some kind of rag falling off of them."
56322,I'm not sure if that's a good thing...
56336,But I've seen what you can do. And heard of the love that Kodlak had for you. The trust. 
56337,"Master Arngeir, are you going to just let him continue to..."
56338,"So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?"
56340,This has been going on for years. And all I've been able to find is murder and blood. I need help.
56342,It's got to be the Imperials! Find them!
56344,"Gods, what have we done?"
56345,"I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer, not a great wanderer, like you."
56353,"If you really are Dragonborn, that is. Before I tell you any more, I need to make sure I can trust you."
56354,Whoa.
56355,The boss is going to cut those creepy cave people to pieces!
56356,"You and I have business to discuss. Ah, but you have not yet reported back to Astrid, have you? Do that, and then we shall talk."
56358,Delvin Mallory and the Dark Brotherhood have... history. He can be trusted.
56361,Why do I always have to be the Elf? I don't want to!
56365,Is that so?
56370,"Why, because I'm a proud citizen of the Empire? Because the Stormcloaks only want Nords in Skyrim?"
56374,"We all knew this was the end. Without even opening the door, we knew what was behind it would kill us."
56375,"Come, my champion."
56377,Just give up!
56380,I'm glad you're coming with us. They say Talos favors you.
56383,"Bolgeir's loyal, but even he doesn't do what I ask. Case in point, this whole assassin thing. Well at least I have you now."
56384,You... you can't do this to me...
56385,No!
56387,"First of all, a son of Skyrim rots in an Imperial prison. We'll be getting him out of there soon."
56390,"You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with your talents."
56392,"Don't even talk to me, Gane."
56393,What now?
56398,What gave it away?
56399,"You look tired, friend. The Bannered Mare has beds for rent."
56402,"But, if we found it first..."
56403,"Yesterday, I saw a dragon fly right over the city. Headed northeast. Toward Shearpoint, by the looks of it."
56404,We take our leave.
56406,"I'm a soldier, not a politician. And my personal beliefs are not yours to question."
56407,Is it that obvious? Sigh. I've got my hands full here.
56409,"Go on, get out of here!"
56412,Let's show these rebels what real soldiers look like.
56413,Just a few more minutes and we'll be in Riften.
56417,But now Alva takes care of me. And I take care of her.
56418,"Oh, I know enough. I know those trouble-making Stormcloaks refuse to submit to Imperial authority. Such seditious behavior. Why it's treason!"
56419,"It's what I do. I make things happen from behind the scenes. After all, here you are."
56420,Only thing better than ridin' a swift horse is ridin' a swift horse over the enemy.
56431,"My presence here will be seen as an affront to some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be leaving your College."
56434,And we gave it to Elisif?
56436,"I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even for a drunk like you."
56440,Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.
56441,"I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane was that and more, but now he's dead. All I ask is a fair chance."
56443,"You think you're tough, huh? Wandering Skyrim is a picnic compared to tunnel crawling!"
56445,Go away!
56446,"I'm the older sister, by nearly five minutes. Sissel's barely worthy to walk in my shadow."
56447,"Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying - of course you don't."
56448,"His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind."
56449,"No one is in charge here. Each Shield-Brother is his own man, each Shield-Sister her own woman."
56452,"Why that's not the same thing at all. The Dominion were invaders. Conquerors. We had to fight them, to preserve our own way of life."
56460,I need some more supplies. Can you help out with that?
56464,(growl)
56466,"If you'll excuse me, I really just want to get home."
56469,You'd be surprised how much work it is selling things at a stall. It's not all standing around and chatting.
56471,I could do this all day. Here's your payment.
56476,"Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful news!"
56480,For shame! You should be locked up for strutting around like that.
56481,"Let's make sure we're just as productive this month as we were last. If Bryling's happy, we're happy."
56482,My brother is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things.
56484,"Damn those Gray-Manes to Oblivion. They want to back the Stormcloaks, they'll get what's comin' to 'em."
56490,"I had a bad time a few years back, an' I turned to drink. But Vignar, he wouldn't let me stay weak."
56491,Shh!
56493,"For now, I'll hold onto this axe. But it's a tenuous peace at best."
56497,"Well, you wanted to find the man responsible for those killings? You'll have plenty of time with the King in Rags when you're in Cidhna mine."
56499,Do you need anything? Are you hungry?
56500,"But rest assured. We've won Skyrim's right to determine her own future. And for that, every Nord praises us. "
56503,"Oh, by the Divines is it that obvious? I swear, if my Gunnar was alive to see me now."
56509,Watch your mouth with me you pup! Who do you think you are?
56510,Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.
56515,"Bolar, I must ask you something."
56516,"Actually, I'm growing it if you hadn't noticed."
56519,Shiny trinkets for your good lady! All crafted by the great Eorlund Gray-Mane himself!
56521,Great job hitting those targets. You definitely surprised me with your speed and composure.
56522,"Yes, yes. Take care of it, Proventus. Whatever it is you're talking about..."
56529,I dreamt that you went away. You made monsters.
56530,The Nords drove them out of the city. Ulfric Stormcloak and his men. That was about 20 years ago.
56534,"My boy Lars has been getting beat senseless, and by a girl, no less!"
56535,We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked.
56539,"An ""interesting"" mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice."
56540,"I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is."
56541,Got ore to dig.
56543,This war's as stupid as our feud with Clan Gray-Mane.
56544,"Ah. Some other time, perhaps?"
56545,Enough!
56546,"I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
56548,"At least tell me where you're going, so we can send someone after you if you don't come back."
56549,Uggh...
56555,Magic. Great.
56557,Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them with will need the support of our armies. 
56560,Can't do that. Sorry.
56562,So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?
56564,I don't like fighting these Dwemer creations. Where's the fun in killing something that doesn't even bleed?
56565,Thanks.
56566,Her blessings are many. To love is to know the true nature of the gods.
56573,Why did Boti send you to me?
56576,"You've never had a taste of sweet Honningbrew? Why, it's only the finest mead outside of Sovngarde!"
56578,"Hello, Fralia dear."
56584,Who did you have to kill to get that blade?
56585,I think you'd better go see Mirabelle Ervine.
56586,"Well, you send that blowhard to me if he steps over the line. "
56587,Don't do that again. Last warning.
56589,Yeah.
56591,"All right, we'll start again, but watch yourself."
56594,"Welcome, sister. Please, enjoy yourself."
56595,"May your sword be sharp, and your tongue sharper."
56597,Beem! What are you doing?
56598,Just ask him where he was on the 30th of Frostfall. He'll know what it means.
56599,What was that?
56601,"Aw, mama, I want to stay and talk with Uncle Ralof!"
56604,Skuli's father is off fighting for the Empire. I'm sure he's just fine.
56610,Want to hear a little Nord wisdom? You don't really know a woman 'til you've had a strong drink and a fistfight with her.
56611,What next?
56613,"My only concern is your safety, mother. One can only imagine the sordid types he may be conspiring with to bring about your downfall."
56617,What I meant to say was... I love having an Orc here in the barracks. They're so... pleasant.
56620,Perhaps you'd care to put your weapon away? Hmm?
56621, 
56624,No idea what's causing it though.
56626,What? How? I thought they weren't allowed within the city!
56627,"Don't play dumb, Tullius!"
56628,Yaaawwwwnn....
56629,"With the rumors going around about how poorly your Guild's been doing, she's become much too bold."
56632,Nivahriin joorre!
56633,J'zargo is listening.
56634,Still have something you need?
56635,But I need your help. We need your help.
56638,"Yes, mother."
56640,"There's an evil to the north, friend, and its name is Ragnvald. A tomb like so many in Skyrim, where the dead have found no peace."
56644,"Now if that don't answer your question, then no words will."
56647,I suppose Giraud sent you for it? I was still trying to get the wording right but here it is.
56648,Son of a...
56649,"Not a day goes by I don't ask that question myself, my dear.  "
56650,"Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long."
56651,"How old is my daughter now, I wonder? In prison, you lose track of time."
56655,"Well. There's something to be said for honesty, I suppose."
56658,"Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth."
56659,Do you realize how delicate the experiment is you've interrupted by sending for me? I may need to throw out the components and start again.
56660,I won't bend. Never!
56661,"Stormcloaks have taken the Reach, but we'll return. The Empire will bring order."
56663,I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given me. But I am not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.
56664,My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?
56668,We can't hold them back! Go! Get to the Barrier! Release the Miasma!
56670,What do you need?
56671,"Uh, yes sir. That's me. The oafish servant."
56672,Take my word to the leaders of your guild and tell them we look forward to a prosperous and profitable future.
56673,A flame atronach's body might provide fire salt. They're dangerous creatures that can be summoned by wizards.
56676,"Nothing, until you choose to use it."
56677,Right.
56679,You got guts walking around with that weapon out. Looking for a fight? Is that it?
56680,"Hey, there's a cave. Bad place to stumble drunk."
56682,"Do you ever think about them, Esbern? The others?"
56685,He's been spending a lot of time at the graves again.
56687,"You looking for a shield? Best thing between you and the enemy, friend."
56688,"The source of the poison must be destroyed once and for all, otherwise another dealer will simply take his place."
56692,Do you have news of our quarry?
56693,Where?
56697,I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf.
56699,Hmm. What's this?
56705,We supply Falkreath to the south. Until recently we supplied Helgen.
56707,"Ummm, Morrowind suffered a massive explosion..."
56709,The thing is... we don't actually have an attic room. But I think I know what you mean. Go ahead and make yourself at home.
56712,"Yes, they have. I can feel the difference already. But of course, I'm far more in tune with these sorts of things than most."
56714,"Hm. Well, if you change your mind, come see me again."
56716,What do you want? Aren't your hands coated with enough blood?
56719,They are perfect. Thank you both.
56722,"Please... How long must I do this? I keep praying, Night Mother. Why won't you answer me?"
56724,"Oh, wow! That was just sitting there? I wish I found it first."
56730,"Falkreath will be turned over to Ulfric, and Dengeir of Stuhn will return as Jarl."
56731,I need someone to take this small keg of Black-Briar Mead to Wilhelm at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead.
56732,I'm in charge now that my parents are in Morthal.
56733,Yet another child has prayed to their mother.
56734,You'll have to catch me first!
56735,"Tsk. And to think, I was going to feed you cabbages and apples again. Yes, little fairy, we can go to the tavern for supper."
56741,"After, growing distrust of magic made life difficult for many. Some left rather than endure the growing hatred from the local Nords."
56742,"My daughter Adrianne wants to forge a new sword for you. Now, it wouldn't be a Skyforge blade, I know, but she really is quite gifted..."
56748,Or give you strength if you happen to offend one.
56749,"I'm too weak right now. Between the spiders and the coven, I'd be dead before escaping the cave."
56750,"I still sense your presence, living fool..."
56754,Go and watch the south road. Come find us if you see any Imperial soldiers coming.
56755,"Then... Whiterun will stand with you, Dragonborn. We will take the risk, and gain the glory, whether it be in victory or defeat!"
56761,"Come on, show yourself!"
56766,"Yamarz has revealed himself as a coward and a schemer, and has earned the fate of all who follow that path."
56767,I... I don't understand. Where is it?
56768,That's enough out of you.
56769,Was there anything else she told you?
56774,"Now, I'm not sure that you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of experience, but can you feel that?"
56777,Wonder what they mine from these walls.
56783,"Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, man, why?"
56793,I send you to your rest.
56795,Here we are. Whiterun. Everybody out.
56796,You've been quiet so far. What do you think we should do?
56799,"Any resident of Solitude can tell you, she was the deadliest person ever to come out of Skyrim."
56800,"What I'm not so sure about is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll keep that between the two of us, alright?"
56803,I'm saying you've got the coin but you didn't earn a septim of it honestly. I can tell.
56806,And what's that have to do with me?
56807,"I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born."
56812,"Oh, my. You'll want to talk to Enmon about that."
56814,I don't dare return to Whiterun. But my mother... She'll need some consolation.
56815,And Elisif?
56816,Look out!
56817,"Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milady. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know."
56820,"Just close the door, will you?"
56828,"Have it your own way, meat."
56833,"There's no way out that way, you know..."
56834,The library is just through here. We're getting close now.
56838,"Why is everyone so upset? If there's Forsworn, the Jarl will take care of them, right?"
56839,"Ahhh, a fine but bloody tale. I can do that one."
56840,You see? That's why I didn't tell you!
56843,A lot of people are beginning to get impressed with you here. Me included. Just wanted to let you know.
56844,I'll bury you in darkness!
56845,"Well... you probably should go collect it before someone else does, shouldn't you?"
56848,"But she's nothing but a puppet for the Empire now, with her husband Torygg dead. Ulfric will make sure she never takes the throne as High Queen."
56849,Hey! What're you doing in here?
56850,It's not you I'm worried about.
56854,Ha! So you did.
56855,Have you spoken to Erik? His father won't let him go out and seek his fortune in the world. Maybe you can help.
56856,"Said he found some old Dwemer artifact, but... well, that was years ago."
56858,"I know you're drunk as usual, but that's no excuse for insulting our hostess."
56861,Pardon me?
56863,Umm... what were we talking about?
56864,Surprised? I guess I'm getting pretty good at my harmless innkeeper act.
56865,Remember that old rusty sword I had? Damn thing must have had over a hundred chips in it.
56866,If I can just... stand up...
56867,"How may I serve you, my Listener?"
56870,I pledged to aid Avulstein and Thorald a long time ago. There's nothing that could keep me from helping them now.
56873,It is planning on starting a fire?
56876,"I will meet with Molag Bal, and I will venerate his altar in Boethiah's name, as I did before."
56877,Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?
56878,"You're that visitor, been pokin' around."
56883,"Snilf, it's me. I don't have a roof over my head either, remember?"
56885,You there! Wait a moment.
56886,Woof.
56887,I suspect we might have use for someone resourceful like you. Not many survived Helgen.
56889,Thanks.
56891,"So that's how it's going to be, huh? Fine. Take your best shot!"
56894,I've been hunting on my own for years.
56895,"Our sisterhood will be better off with you dead, brat."
56897,But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries.
56898,"Not so ridiculous, really. I know people don't think much of her. But she is the Jarl after all.  Plenty of folk would kill to be in her shoes."
56901,You keep your distance with that magic
56902,No Firebrand Wine yet? How disappointing.
56903,"This was your crazy idea, huh?"
56904,Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!
56905,"If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher, things will never be the same for the Guild."
56907,You want Thonar Silver-Blood. He handles all the family business.
56910,"Come, Legate. There's much to do."
56914,No?
56915,"Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to hold a captive dragon - hence its name."
56920,That's a decent weapon you've made there.
56921,Don't make me wait too long. I get bored very easily.
56922,"Things are much better now that Grelod is dead, but still. I'm sick of this place."
56923,It's clear that memories are far too short.
56925,Gah! This staff is useless... I'm useless. The whole world is useless!
56927,A bit of jewelry for your journey home?
56933,"Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet... I call it Honningbrew Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate."
56934,I have no idea what to do!
56936,I won't bend. Never!
56940,There's no shame in such thoughts. A man without doubts is a man without a conscience. 
56941,Get that thing out of here!
56943,What? You!
56945,Good. Do not spare them your blade.
56952,Don't come near me! I don't want to get hurt again.
56955,"How goes it, son?"
56959,"They are good, loyal children."
56961,"Here, ya' did me a favor, I guess I owe you one."
56962,"Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you, and you block it with the ward. Here we go."
56964,You made it!
56966,"If anyone sneaks up on us, I'll smell them coming. Or I might not. We'll see."
56967,"I ought to get back to work before I'm missed, but... did anyone else escape? Did Ulfric..."
56971,We're going to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it.
56972,"Now, how would you like me to align the Phial's properties? "
56973,"I'll tell you one thing, if you don't make peace with them soon you may get a walkout on your hands. Then we're both in trouble."
56975,"For someone in possession of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's play."
56976,"I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible..."
56979,"We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Bear pelts."
56980,My experiments continue to go well thanks to you. How can I return the favor?
56981,What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!
56985,"That's true, but I'm in a new house now. A better house."
56990,I don't think so. That axe is mine.
56991,Worried one of them is going to take your place?
56992,"If people aren't tired, they're angry, and if they aren't angry, they're afraid. It's made keeping order a mess."
56998,Sometimes I think we deserve these miserable lives of ours.
56999,"I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me."
57002,"You want to know a secret of mine, young girl? The most effective poison to kill a man? A potion to make others fall in love, perhaps?"
57003,"Miss Temba is much happier now that you took care of those bears. She may not look like she is, but I can tell."
57006,You look like you've seen your share of adventure.
57007,"Dark Brotherhood? You look the type. Listen, there's this Grim Shieldmaiden walking the streets of Markarth. Kill her. Now take this gold, and go."
57008,Come quietly or taste the Jarl's justice!
57010,The others do not speak. Their Voices are too powerful for you to withstand.
57018,I can teach you a few things.
57021,Have you seen it?
57022,"Can I have it?  It's worthless to you, but I can pay."
57023,"Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned."
57024,No. I wouldn't.
57025,"Whatever. The person you probably want is Nelacar. He's in the Frozen Hearth. Be careful, he was exiled from the College for a reason."
57026,"Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own."
57029,"I'm still busy, but I can always make time to speak with you."
57036,"Guard might get nervous, a woman approaches with her weapon drawn..."
57045,We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle up in Haafingar.
57047,How does a knife in the gut sound? It's 200 gold or your life.
57048,I cannot be defeated!
57049,"Restoration is a perfectly valid school of magic, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!"
57050,"Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now you, my girl, have definitely come to the right place."
57051,Shhh. Listen to Enthir... we can't afford to miss a single detail.
57052,"Dagur and I have an understanding. He gives me privacy, and I make sure my experiments don't blow up his inn."
57054,"I'd even buy one of your relatives, if you're looking to sell. Ha ha ha ha. That's a little joke."
57055,How did you do that?
57058,"Without all our money going to drink, I can afford to expand my selection a bit."
57059,I'm the best at breaking up rocks. Thorgar says so.
57063,"I'm sorry, just... Just don't hurt me. I know you're not one of them, but you just can't help them. You can't let them know I'm here."
57066,"Don't worry about Nelacar. He has a permanent room here at the Inn, but he keeps to himself and doesn't cause any trouble."
57069,Alduin... we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here... you defeated him?
57070,Agh! Flithy n'wah!
57071,It's got nothing to do with the coin... this is my life we're talking about.
57074,"Hello, child of Kynareth."
57077,"Ah, Indara. Arkay's blessing upon you and your husband. Spend as much time here as you need. "
57078,"Winterhold doesn't offer much, but we like living here. Been here all our lives."
57080,"I have a very close relationship with Savos Aren, the current Arch-Mage."
57081,"Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but they insisted they had her favor."
57082,"What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis."
57083,Here to shame an old woman? Leave me be.
57085,Excellent. They should be ready for us now.
57086,"The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right?"
57090,What are you doing here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or guards.
57091,He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.
57094,I never asked you to help in the first place. Why would I? Everyone in Skyrim only helps themselves.
57095,No! You're wrong. You must be wrong. Laelette may have met her fate out in the marsh.
57099,"No. Of course you're right, Unmid. I'll stay here for now."
57102,"Oh, I couldn't. Goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things to do..."
57103,Here you are. Always good to see a fellow bard. Tell Giraud I said hello.
57104,"As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be."
57105,One of those icebrains who wanders the land getting people's hopes up. 
57108,"It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war."
57110,I'm not going out there. Not with that dragon on the loose.
57111,That's a fine potion you've put together.
57113,"And let me guess, that someone is my so-called husband Leigelf? Well the feeling's mutual."
57115,"I'll see if I can't get some work done inside, where it's warm."
57117,"Your path differs from most. You are being guided, pushed towards something."
57118,"I already knew Delvin, I asked if I could join up, and that was that."
57120,I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter. All I need to know is where she is.
57124,Too many dark elves in Windhelm complain about the way we're treated. What good does complaining do?
57125,"What troubles you, my son?"
57127,Help! I'm being attacked!
57129,Sir!
57130,"Ooh. What a fun trick. Teach me, teach me!"
57133,Protect yourself! We're under some kind of attack!
57134,"Niranye, I just have to know -- what is your secret?"
57138,"If you change your mind, I'll be here."
57139,"Go away! I don't know who you are, but this is my spot! Whatever's on that ship is mine!"
57140,"I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems."
57145,"Here you go, I think you'll find these quite useful."
57146,"Forgive me, my lord. It was foolish of me to make such a suggestion."
57147,Poor Horgeir. Everyone in town knows about his wife's affair but him. Probably better if he doesn't know.
57150,"If you deal with Nimhe, I'll let you into both the excavation site and my Dwemer Museum. What do you say?"
57151,Let's hear it.
57153,"Please, don't get rid of me! I need the coin. I... I'll work for free for the rest of this week. Please!"
57157,You dare dishonor the Legion?
57159,We have nothing to talk about. I can't believe what you did to me.
57160,No. I'm not. I feel like my scales are clawing into me. Maybe you could help an old Argonian out?
57164,"Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say."
57168,Look around you. Don't you know what their little war is about? They want all non-Nords out of Skyrim. That means you and me.
57170,"Sure, I understand. It's not easy to go from being executed by the Legion one day to joining up the next."
57171,He could have anything in there. War contraband. Weapons. Skooma. Ain't no way I'm getting involved in any of that.
57177,"We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten?"
57179,"Brother! Mara's mercy, it's good to see you!"
57180,An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
57182,"To kill a pirate captain, on her own ship no less? Simply masterful!"
57183,Ours. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be ours.
57186,You should talk to Ainethach. He's in charge.
57187,Drop it off and he'll trade you something for the delivery. Keep it as payment for the legwork.
57198,"He promised me, swore on his ancestors, that he'd give up the mead. And what do I find out? He's been stashing drink in a cave nearby."
57199,No! Blackreach was to be my discovery!
57202,Very well.
57203,"Ah, and word has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely demise."
57204,"And so Alduin's lordship passes to you. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly submit to your mastery of the Thu'um."
57206,"But... no more than a handful of us remain, brother."
57213,"All those rules, all that discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit."
57219,Have a good contract.
57220,What? And you call yourself a daughter of Skyrim?
57223,There's this old man. I've seen him around Riften. I don't know where he lives. I don't know his name.
57224,Get to Dawnstar and see what you can find out about these rogues. I'd wager they won't be too far from the tavern.
57225,"We'll look the other way this time, but even the Jarl's influence has its limits. Be more careful."
57226,"Not that I'd know anything about it, of course, but it seems to me that the last thing a thieves' guild would want is to draw attention to itself."
57227,Hhhhuuuuuhhh....
57230,"You are now in the Arcanaeum, of which I am in charge. It might as well be my own little plane of Oblivion."
57231,Hopefully any discoveries made in your pursuits will be shared with the members of the College first. That way we all benefit.
57233,"So, Brand-Shei... business as awful for you as it is for all of us?"
57234,"Don't you ever find it demeaning, working for that Nord family?"
57237,Make yourself at home.
57239,I'm not that foolish. The last thing I want is a war with your people.
57242,"Sure, sure. We're always looking to get our hands on items from all over Skyrim. How about this one?"
57244,Zii!
57247,"Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true."
57248,"If you need more food or drink, speak to Hulda."
57249,What? You've been lollygagging in idle reading?
57250,"Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy..."
57251,I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.
57254,I hear people were spotted using the Black Door. Gods have mercy.
57256,"I really don't mean to be rude, friend, but I'm not feeling particularly sociable..."
57257,Nice to have a new face around. It gets boring here sometimes. 
57258,"Keep yourself safe, traveler."
57261,"You can't attack my family and get away with it, fetcher! I will have an apology, or your head on a spike. Choose."
57263,Because I was clumsy enough to be captured.
57265,"Well, yes. This is rather embarrassing, but it seems I've misplaced something."
57269,"You must find out how he does this, before he regains his strength and returns."
57270,Teach you to mess with me.
57273,The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Nine.
57274,This war is such nonsense. All this fuss over their false human god.
57280,"We are all Ashlanders now, brother. Good to find another family that cares where they came from, eh?"
57281,Aventus really did it! He got the Dark Brotherhood to kill old Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
57283,"Are you thinking you're better than me? I crawled west out of the wasteland, so show some respect."
57288,"I think her mother, Tova, has the key."
57291,Hmph. Suit yourself.
57293,"Vilkas said you are the new Kodlak. I don't know what that means, but you seem honorable, so that's good."
57298,"I appreciate everything you've done for us, but I really am quite busy."
57299,"Do you have guidance for me, Harbinger?"
57301,"Ah, pardon me, friend. I didn't see you standing there."
57302,As long as they're playing instruments they're passable. You don't want to hear them sing.
57303,So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about.
57307,I'm willing to let the Dragonborn decide the fairness of my request.
57310,But what I ask of you... it must be done. There is too much at stake.
57311,He was the one I looked up to. I need to find my brother.
57312,"I was wondering if you had ordered the shipment of that frostwheat, sir."
57313,"Likewise. Now, I have a lot to do, so I'm afraid you'll just have to leave!"
57317,There's enough for all of us if you aren't greedy.
57319,The look on Tullius's face while the Greybeard read the terms was worth the trip.
57326,I'll make sure it's sent right away.
57334,Can't do it.
57335,Yeah... fired. Sure. That's what I meant.
57338,"Head for the Great Hall, quickly! Don't stop for anything!"
57340,"As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was two hundred years ago..."
57344,At long last. An ancient evil is avenged. The shades of many Blades salute you this day.
57345,"You'll be back. If you're really Dragonborn, this is your destiny."
57347,"I've made a few of the Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard berry sauce is to die for."
57348,Why can't Froa do it?
57353,Let me know as soon as you've found anything.
57356,"Don't worry about it, Svana. It's my problem... no need for you to get involved."
57357,"That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!"
57358,"Yes, a Grand one. Soon, please."
57359,"By Sithis, help me!"
57360,Did something happen to it?
57364,Who's there?
57365,"I've lived through rebellion, Forsworn, undead, witches, wizards, hagravens, and marriage."
57366,"I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe those sorts of things."
57370,"Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down there, please do be careful."
57374,"If he does show up with a bride, we'll have to move quickly."
57377,Are you joking? Even I wouldn't sell something like that.
57379,"Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends ""hello"" right back at them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks - all are welcome here!"
57383,"Fail, and it won't matter anyway."
57385,Men are utter pigs... they only care about one thing.
57392,Maybe you can help me.
57394,"The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has not defeated Skyrim!"
57401,Beirand said you got here just before the execution. Must have been a lovely first sight.
57402,We're not leaving here until we get what we came for.
57403,"First on my list, is a problem with our supply caravans being constantly harassed by a giant. Need to deal with that hairy brute. And soon."
57407,Not at all. I consider it a blessing.
57408,He got some letter from the Legion and has left it alone since then.
57409,Was. Forsworn came in the night. Killed everyone. Gat and I are the only ones who escaped.
57411,Please hurry. The Captain of the Guard isn't patient when it comes to tasting time.
57412,Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Had a room here I think. Ask the innkeeper.
57413,"Also, I need a peek inside Imperial headquarters, ideally lifting some documents detailing their plans. I need to know what to concentrate on."
57414,"Being brought up by a poor family, I had to learn how to steal if I wanted to make ends meet."
57415,I'm betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and that he can finger our buyer.
57418,"Thirty years ago, they invaded the Empire and came close to destroying it. They smashed the Blades in the process."
57419,How's it going? You find anything yet?
57420,Let's talk inside.
57422,"Petty threats and fist waving are not going to sway me. You people are all talk, and everyone knows it!"
57423,Well that's just it. Some of them might not be sacred.
57424,Don't cause any trouble in the city.
57434,"Best offense is a good defense, am I right?"
57435,"Little blood to clear the air. Hope you have the stomach for it, outsider."
57440,"Please, you can't tell anyone. It must remain a secret! I'll do whatever you want."
57443,Good observation. What else?
57449,Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.
57450,"But even the Blades didn't see the Great War coming. We underestimated the Thalmor, and they destroyed us."
57451,"Yes, but that fool Endario can't get it in. I'll thrash him when I get back to the city, don't you worry."
57452,And my children?
57453,"Her name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out."
57454,"Fancy yourself the adventuring type, eh? It's just as well, I doubt your combat prowess would prove valuable in a real battle anyway."
57456,"Will she put aside her personal hatred for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that the suffering of our people will end? "
57459,That's what this lesson is for. Perfect time to try it out.
57462,"He would lie in bed, paralyzed with fear, imagining his own nightmares coming to life. Ooohhh... Scary."
57467,"Eat? No, I don't think I'm... hungry. Not now, at least."
57468,"Ah, Vlindrel Hall's a fine home, if you can afford it. The steward in the keep can tell you more."
57471,"If it does to you, dear, that's all that matters."
57475,"As part of your initiation, Master Einarth will allow you to tap into his understanding of ""Ro."""
57476,Head to the Riften jail and talk to Sibbi. Get him to tell you where Frost and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside Riften.
57479,"Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, brother."
57481,Those bastards will regret raising their weapons against Jorrvaskr.
57484,What in the name of Oblivion do you want?
57485,"Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener."
57487,You require the services of the Fool of Hearts?
57488,"I just feel like if I'm not here, then something could go wrong. Nils is a hard worker, but I wouldn't trust him to run things."
57489,"If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead Hjaalmarch?"
57490,Make up your mind already.
57492,"Well, you've come to the right place."
57493,"The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and assume the roll of master chef."
57495,"That is the truth, my friend! Maven is a saint and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
57499,I don't have anything to say.
57502,"Well, I was only trying to help."
57503,You're a disgrace to your own kind!
57504,There's one more thing. We know about Paarthurnax.
57505,Because you wanted to learn the longer blades. Aela's never used anything bigger than a dagger.
57507,Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!
57508,Now it is your turn.
57511,What in the nine holds is that?
57515,"Yes, papa."
57521,"I give them access to my business associates, and they keep my coffers full."
57525,Mara be praised!
57530,"You have a death wish, then? If you know that name, you must know to meet him would be to meet your end."
57531,"Whatever is going on, whatever you're up to... Be very careful."
57532,Did you just talk back to me? I'm not paid to listen. I'm paid to keep you working. Now work.
57534,"But I digress. Here, let me give you these. They are to be delivered to your, um... superior."
57536,Good. I'll be waiting right here.
57537,"What did I do? Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry."
57540,"Though we live in shadow, we carve indelible signs of our passing into the world."
57542,Masters of the Way of the Voice. They live in seclusion high on the slopes of the Throat of the World.
57544,"Fastred, we must speak."
57552,"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical..."
57555,My power is supreme!
57559,"Brand-Shei, do you think you can find me some theilul?"
57560,We never should have brought that thing here!
57561,"You can't kick me out of here. You want me gone, you're gonna have to kill me."
57563,No but my husband Torygg would want a proper burial and this is the way Nords are buried in Skyrim.
57564,"The Night Mother may have spoken to you, but I am still the leader of this Family. I will not have my authority so easily dismissed."
57569,"The torture room. Gods, I wish we didn't need these...."
57570,"My Eorlund is the finest blacksmith in Skyrim, and that's not just a wife's boasting."
57571,Be careful out there... Riften can be dangerous.
57572,"Kill him now, while we still can!"
57573,"Please, lead on."
57575,I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself.
57576,You're back.
57577,Adara bends the silver so naturally. Grandmother would have cried if she saw how deft our daughter has become.
57578,"We all are, my dear, but sometimes the Divines reward those who don't seem to deserve it. Call it dumb luck."
57581,"By the Hist, what a sight...."
57583,Every Nord should admire Ulfric. He fights for all of us.
57584,"Oh, great, another wanderer. Slumming it on your way to Windhelm?"
57585,"Watch it, there, brother."
57586,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
57587,It's Grelod!
57589,He can't treat me like that. He needs me.
57590,"Ah, you're back. So, how went your first real contract? A bit more exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager."
57592,Arkay's blessing to you.
57599,When are you gonna do somethin' to help Falion? Stop people sayin' things about him?
57601,"More dangerous than you know. Left alone, however, he will awaken when he has grown too powerful to be stopped. This is the only way to be sure."
57603,Hi there.
57604,"You met the Lylvieves? Quiet family, but they're the heart of Dragon Bridge."
57605,Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!
57608,Is that the one about something buried beneath Saarthal? Something that men and mer fought over?
57609,You'd better hope the war's over by then. The Stormcloaks would eat you alive!
57610,"No, and I'm not about to either. I value my life you know... you may want to remember that for yourself."
57611,"Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd be calling on the Dark Brotherhood."
57616,A man in my position makes lots of enemies. But what is a life-threatening situation if not an opportunity for mutual benefit? Hmmm?  
57617,"If you happen to see it, would you mind bringing it to me?"
57618,And make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his... ally arrive! They could be planning another meeting at any time!
57623,"Now aren't you a strange one. Well, if you're here to shop, shop. If not, find some other caravan to stalk."
57624,"Thanks again for saving my life. I think I'm done with venturing outside of Markarth, though."
57625,"I hope you're having a good time. Actually, I hope I'm having a good time. I could care less about you."
57626,"If you must venture southwest, stay clear of Volskygge. It is a cursed place, a tomb where the dead still live..."
57629,"So, have you shown those furry menaces that I mean business?"
57631,Absolutely. Did you still want to buy one?
57632,That fetcher! I gave him the same keg just this morning and told him to store it in the cellars.
57635,Certainly.
57636,"Without us looking out for Winterhold, it's doomed. Simply doomed."
57641,"As you were, then."
57642,Be seeing you.
57643,"Good. Maybe we can lay up for a while. I hate to put your family in danger, Gerdur, but..."
57644,I can't believe Fastred ran off to Riften with that... that bastard.
57645,What the..?
57648,Huh? What's that now? Leave me alone.
57651,"The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!"
57653,That's what comes of trying to win a war with a bare handful of legions. If the Emperor would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!
57654,Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls. Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?
57655,So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire.
57658,"Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of material he could on locations the Guild could heist."
57660,A warrior marches on the gut. Here. This should give you strength. I'll cook another tomorrow.
57661,"Yes, but not likely the one you intend."
57664,"My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed."
57665,The good mine is closed and the other mine has no ore. Gods have cursed me.
57672,I'm sorry I lost myself for a moment there. I just need some time to get over the loss.
57673,Nyargh!
57675,Yes...
57678,"He couldn't just kill me, you see. We're technically part of each other. But he was able to banish me from his domain."
57680,"Well, I seem to have misplaced it at the moment. But it was white, like alabaster, with three bright rubies set in it."
57683,Good to see you. At least you know how to treat someone properly.
57685,I can't believe you're doing this! Stop!
57688,"Arch-Mage or not, my rules about books still stand."
57689,Tolfdir and I can try and keep this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now.
57691,What do you want? You've caused enough trouble.
57693,Enthusiasm. Good. Here's the key to the dig site.
57694,"They used to be pretty feared around here. I mean, you'd whisper the name and it'd send chills down your spine."
57695,Mages need to be reminded to be careful around research materials.
57696,I meditate on the Rotmulaag - the Words of Power. I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.
57697,"At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be."
57701,I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long since we've had a good bandit raid.
57703,"Call it what you want. You don't pay, then you're not getting in."
57705,I'd prove to be quite an asset to the Thieves Guild... I'm one of the best fences in Skyrim.
57706,Let's see where this goes.
57707,I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him.
57708,"I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master."
57709,What can I do for you?
57710,The city guard has been tearing Riften apart looking for the source of our skooma problem. I'd hate to be in their shoes if they get discovered.
57712,Not now.
57713,See? I knew Aren wouldn't leave me in here!
57716,I'm feeling much better thanks to your efforts.
57720,First the war and now there's talk of dragons. What's next?
57722,"Every now and again, we like to remind the shopkeepers that we're in charge."
57724,Hmm? What do you want?
57725,"The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The dwarves had machines for this sort of thing."
57733,"And in that moment, the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free!"
57734,It's not like there's anything to do here but drink anyway.
57735,"Go on, then. Deliver my message to Sibbi."
57736,We will keep each other safe. No matter what.
57737,"Well, there's Ingun Black-Briar, Maven's daughter. Strange girl. She likes to spend time down in Elgrim's Elixirs working on her alchemy."
57741,"Eight septims for breaking your back, and then you live in squalor. How much is your dignity worth?"
57742,"Ah, Nivenor. What can I sell you on this fine day?"
57749,"And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!"
57751,"Alik'r, hold!"
57752,"I hope you're here for friendlier reasons now... after all, I'm all paid up."
57754,May the earth beneath your feet be always soft.
57758,"Keep your eyes on him, he's quite crafty."
57759,"Ain't nobody high and mighty in these halls, exceptin' the Jarl. And don't you forget!"
57760,"The Empire has stretched itself too far. This rebellion in Skyrim is one problem, but solving it won't fix everything."
57763,Fus...
57766,I tried to tell them. They wouldn't listen. Fools. It's all come true... all I could do was watch our doom approach...
57768,"No, no. Just watch over him."
57771,I'm going to... put you down!
57772,Gotta keep my eyes open. Damned dragons could swoop down at any time.
57774,Dagon's Mythic Dawn cult killed the Septim Dynasty and opened the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel. They called it the Oblivion Crisis.
57775,There goes another one.
57776,What could this place be?
57779,I help my father in more ways than people realize.
57780,"Personally, I've always found Argonians to be incredibly unpredictable opponents. Especially near water."
57782,"Preparing the defenses is almost impossible lately, every time we get a new war report our needs change."
57789,One day the war will end and the true heirs of Skyrim will inherit this great realm.
57790,I'm not paying any of you a single septim... ever! Now get out of my inn!
57794,"Lead on, sister."
57797,"As it turns out, I've got two new contracts. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge."
57799,"Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer selves."
57800, 
57803,"Look, I like you, so I'll tell it to you straight. Brynjolf and the rest are in the Guild, and they're ready to cut you down."
57809,The box contains the heart. The essence of a god.
57810,"Let's try and stay together, the sorcerers in these places tend to... well, harvest bodies for parts."
57811,I hope you've got some coin.
57812,Any word on that fire?
57814,No. I can't risk weakening the city while we are under the threat of enemy attack. I'm sorry.
57817,"Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you."
57819,That's her business. Not mine. Probably not yours either.
57821,One of the mages there may be able to put you on the trail of this Elder Scroll.
57822,"The same place I learned my charm and quick wits: I used to be an Imperial ranger, my boy!"
57823,No. It's mine!
57824,"You know, in the Priesthood of Arkay, we have a joke about an empty pocket being better than a full grave."
57826,"It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be honest. Don't pay much, either.  "
57827,"When you've completed all those, we'll see if I might have some more."
57832,Or perhaps there's something you'd like to confess?
57835,"Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return."
57840,We need to talk.
57842,"You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates."
57844,Do you think the Stormcloaks will sit idle while this dragon is slaughtering my men and burning down my city?
57846,"This is a dwarven artifact beyond nearly all value. A singular instrument of immense power, a tool of impossible import."
57847,Yamarz charged me with keeping outsiders away from Largashbur. You would have me disobey him?
57848,"No, Housecarl!"
57849,"The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now."
57851,He's barred the door. Gods only know how he's... defiling the bodies of my ancestors in there!
57852,"You come here where you're not wanted, you eat our food, you pollute our city with your stink and you refuse to help the Stormcloaks."
57853,"None of our spells were potent enough, none of our wills were strong enough."
57859,I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable.
57860,Name's Angi and if you try anything stupid I won't hesitate to put in arrow in your head.
57862,"She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it."
57866,*Sigh* I was part of the gang in the ruins here. Friend of mine went crazy and stole the boss' sword. They blamed me for it.
57867,We take our leave.
57869,"You and Madanach are animals, and I'll see you both rot to death in Cidhna Mine for this."
57877,You damn gray-skin. Go back to Morrowind!
57879,"That's good armor you've got there, friend. Iron, solid and true."
57881,"Lost the last one I gave you? Very well, here you are. Mara keep you."
57882,"Right. Well, you let me know if you need anything."
57884,"Walk always in shadow, my Listener."
57886,"You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well, I have!"
57887,"A pleasure, thane."
57892,"That's right. College of Winterhold, just north of town. Hard to miss."
57893,"Not now, I'm working."
57894,I told you my sister would help us out.
57897,"Now, of course I must ask... Killing the Emperor... How much did Motierre pay for such a thing?"
57904,"Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now."
57909,I never thought I'd see Kolskeggr again.
57912,The Jarl of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.
57913,"It certainly is. Was, I suppose."
57915,Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me!
57916,This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.
57917,One more... pull...
57920,Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy a nice bit of swamp in Black Marsh.
57921,"You know, I can still sell you some potions and such, or train you in alchemy."
57924,"Your quick mastery of a new Thu'um is... astonishing. I'd heard the stories of the abilities of Dragonborn, but to see it for myself..."
57925,Ah! That felt refreshing.
57926,Yeah? What?
57927,"Oh, there's a better way."
57930,"And you have companionship. A child of night, and a stalker of the sands. Together, you are a family."
57935,"Ulfric did right killing him. Soon we'll rid Skyrim of elves, their bloody Justiciars, and the Jarls in their pockets. The whole damn lot of them."
57937,Come back here!
57939,Couldn't have done it better myself. Here's your coin.
57940,"The honor has been mine. You should be proud of what we've accomplished here. The Dark Brotherhood is no more. And the Emperor, finally, is safe."
57942,"Why are you still standing there? Hurry, before the meeting begins."
57943,"Weren't expecting that, were you!"
57944,And their heretical artifacts grant powers to mortals that wreak havoc across Tamriel. They must be destroyed or guarded to prevent temptation.
57946,"Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing!"
57949,I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
57950,Bex!
57953,"Your path now follows his, though you will arrive too late."
57956,"Kill these two, and I'll have one last contract to give you. I'm just finalizing some details now."
57961,"Don't know her. Guards dragged that Forsworn's body away, though. Last we'll hear of that."
57966,*cough*
57969,I think the time might be right for another public appearance. Maybe address the patrons at the Bannered Mare? Or visit Jorrvaskr?
57972,Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?
57973,I've been hurt worse before.
57974,Try not to disappoint. Or to get her killed.
57975,"Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining."
57976,Please don't kill Constance Michel. She really is kind.
57977,"More coin means more supplies, and that means more useful balms, potions and remedies for everyone."
57979,"You really don't know anything about this, do you?"
57987,"I'm all for diplomacy, but the sooner the Emperor deals with this civil war mess, the sooner we can get back to Cyrodiil."
57989,You expect me to believe that?
57992,Then find one. That dung heap Grisvar's been known to make a few.
57995,"I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn."
57996,"I think I have a few old spell books laying about. If you want more, you'll have to go to the College of Winterhold."
57997,I think Brynjolf can give you all the information you need.
58000,"Oddly enough, Spriggans. Usually they let alone, but for some reason, this particular grove isn't."
58003,Good job. Now here's your part of the deal.
58004,"We want Kraldar removed as Jarl of Winterhold, and an Imperial candidate put in his place."
58005,"Why am I not surprised to learn Cicero is alive? I still can't stomach the little clown, but if you've welcomed him here, I won't question it."
58009,Nearly broke my back out in the mines today. Damn Nords should bleed for putting us through this!
58010,"Sorry's not good enough! Not while my Gleda is still out there, alone and afraid. You kidnapped her and sold her to that Giant."
58011,Alva told me later that she never showed up. I never got to tell her good bye.
58012,The prisoners just walk right out.
58014,He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find.
58015,What did you need?
58016,"Man like you needs a warhorse, I reckon."
58021,Move! Up the tower!
58023,And Mercer Frey?
58027,Yes. That's why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing.
58030,Oh... I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of the ancients who built this place.
58039,"Yamarz is proud, and refuses to see that we need outside help."
58040,Buying and selling a wide range of assorted goods! The best selection in Windhelm!
58041,"Now surely even you know about Pelagius' decree? On his deathbed - oh, and this was inspired - he forbade... death! That's right! Death! Outlawed!"
58042,I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
58043,Brother.
58045,We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.
58047,"Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!"
58050,"Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching."
58051,"But I digress. Here, take these. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior."
58053,I'm not accustomed to dealing with people who are unreliable. That's why I asked Delvin to send me his best.
58060,I had no idea you were a man of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?
58061,"Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die."
58063,Haven't you figured it out yet? What more needs to happen before you all wake up and see what's going on?
58066,I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.
58068,I really need to get back to planning my wedding..
58069,"In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess."
58070,I'm just trying to imagine you hiding inside the body of a mammoth. Bloody brilliant idea.
58072,That's about the only harmless thing you can do in this city. Silver-Blood Inn is the place to go.
58073,"Madena, I was wondering if you could help me with something. Your magic would be invaluable."
58074,"Gallus would call her his ""little nightingale."" He was absolutely smitten by her."
58075,We Gray-Manes have been feuding with the Battle-Borns for years. There's no more bitter enemy than an old friend.
58076,"I ain't going to lie, it's still pretty bad."
58077,Steal anything worth talking about?
58080,Make sure that she is.
58081,How quickly you've advanced. Most impressive.
58083,The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.
58086,"And of course, they'll be caught off guard thinking we're off doing something altogether different."
58093,"In fact, If you collected parts of the Edda from any Bard you encountered in your travels I would be willing to pay you for them."
58094,I can't believe the Empire would turn its back on Talos.
58095,Even good hammers warp metal if struck without care.
58098,"The Whalebone Bridge he bade me guard and winnow all those souls whose heroic end sent them here, to Shor's lofty hall"
58100,Need some metal hammered?
58101,"Delve to its limits, and Blackreach lies just beyond."
58102,We've also had run-ins with spies attempting to probe our security for weaknesses. I work with the city guard to make certain they fail.
58103,Glory to the repulsive!
58105,What's the most dangerous beast you've ever killed?
58107,"I was only trying to help you, you know!"
58108,This one always sticks... there we go.
58109,That gave me the shivers!
58110,"The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you."
58111,Sorry. You already have an animal with you.
58112,I need you to break into Mercer's home and search for anything that could tell us where he's gone.
58114,Really? Where?
58115,"Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself."
58117,Hircine chose you to lead the Great Hunt. So lead.
58118,You must be all right if you've got time to complain.
58120,"The only thing I need to do, dear wife, is make sure profits are up, no matter what. If Thongvor won't do the dirty work, I will."
58125,Good. Make sure not one of them escapes alive.
58126,You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.
58130,We remember all those Solitude soldiers out fighting the good fight in this thankless war.
58137,"She's a maid. Old, and feeble. But with this contract it's much more a matter of ""where"" than ""who."""
58139,"Thank you, dear."
58141,"Where do these demands stop, Ulfric? Do you expect me to surrender all of Skyrim?"
58143,It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
58145,"Okay, okay. You've talked me into it."
58146,"One sip of the elixir and your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or perhaps limitless power could be yours!"
58151,"You're a firebrand, aren't you?"
58152,"Spare me, please!"
58154,If you like. But we need to find a way to unlock that trap door.
58157,"I lost my own daughter to the Imperial dogs, and by Talos I'll not lose anyone else!"
58163,Just looking at you makes me upset.
58168,"Well. Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect. Take her downstairs."
58172,Hey! Somebody get down here! Help!
58173,But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for his arrest. I want you to break in to his home and find evidence.
58176,"Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word."
58177,Hello? Who's there?
58178,Thank you! Here... I stole a lot from the Thalmor over the years. You may as well have some of it.
58184,"Yes, yes, go. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens..."
58185,"It has everything to do with politics. Asgeir my son, you have so much to learn."
58186,"Everything in here seems to be about death. Burial urns, crypts, funeral shrouds. It's a bit depressing."
58187,My father taught me an important lesson many years ago.
58188,"Of course! I undersand completely. You just put us in a room, and I'll do all the talking. No worries at all."
58190,"I have to admit, I admire your courage. Most folk in Skyrim wouldn't go near a place like this."
58191,I guess I was just hearing things.
58193,Citizens! Go home and lock your doors!
58194,"Oh, well thank you. I'll try and read this if I can."
58195,"Thank you, oh thank you."
58196,"There's only the shards of the blade left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?"
58197,Sleep? I can't sleep now! There's too much to be done. And what's this Void you're rambling on about?
58201,Come in. Quickly now.
58202,"My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy yourself."
58203,"Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting."
58205,Is that so? Does the name Gleda ring a bell? The star beauty of my farm? Kidnapped by a drunk lout and sold to a Giant?
58208,Those around you will perceive you as normal and you will find the words you utter may not be your own.
58210,Get nervous around dwarven stonework. Legends say these cities are haunted.
58211,Looks like it's my lucky day.
58212,"By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon."
58218,Anything else you want to say?
58219,"Wait, what are you doing?"
58222,"My brothers would have been appalled to see a man outdone by his wife, but not me. Without Katla, this farm would fall apart."
58225,Good doin' business with ya.
58228,"Look, come back tomorrow, okay? If I have anything left that's not sold or spoiled, you can have it."
58229,Send another one in here! Send two! I don't care!
58230,"Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them."
58234,The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur. 
58236,Let the field mouse run. Your pay will be double.
58237,"You're not at all what I expected. I imagined you'd be fatter, honestly."
58238,"So glad we kept you in Skyrim. Serving your Emperor was worth the wait, of course."
58239,"You there, uh, the finest silver in Markarth is sold right here."
58241,If only Savos were alive to see this...
58243,"Travel great Skyrim, and Kynareth travels with you."
58244,Emperor Pelagius III.
58253,"So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and find out exactly what it is he wants."
58254,"Filthy she-hound Elisif got what she deserved. Let her serve as ""High Queen"" of Oblivion, for all I care."
58256,Turns out who runs Winterhold doesn't change much. Can't say I'm surprised.
58260,"Oh, I'm a good keeper of secrets. Have to be, in this hall."
58261,Dragonborn? What are you talking about?
58263,Are you awake? 
58266,"We own Cidhna Mine. Best prison in Skyrim, and source of half the wealth in this city."
58268,I can't believe we let provincials like you wander Skyrim.
58269,You're a dead woman!
58271,"I've made a lot of new contacts thanks to you, and more contacts means more coin for everyone."
58272,You can't shake us off that easily. Let's see what's here!
58273,Good luck.
58276,But his death was avenged long ago. You have taken more lives than honor demanded.
58282,What's the point in protecting this place if the mine's completely useless? Idiots.
58284,"Good work. Here's your cut. I guess this finishes up our contract with the Silver-Bloods, so we'll be heading out."
58285,"Watch your tongue, native. We'll leave when we're sure there's no Forsworn here."
58286,"You could be the one I seek... if your will is strong, lure a thrall to my shrine. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice. Then slay him."
58290,Vilkas and I have been here since we were little whelps.
58292,"You wish to leave now? In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?"
58294,"I have to work, or Anton will rip my head off."
58299,"""...and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire."""
58301,Always time for a fellow bard.
58305,Vampire dust? Seriously?
58313,How about... we play tag! You're it!
58314,Certainly! It's a fine tune and a good request!
58315,I'll be waiting by the door for everyone to be distracted.
58316,You do realize there's only one way this can end.
58317,Seems to me like it just ended... it's never really ended for me.
58319,"""I survived""?"
58321,Hmm. Nothing here after all.
58322,"Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help."
58323,By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of the Jarl.
58325,"We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us."
58327,If there's someone in the palace who can speak for you and wouldn't mind walking you around. Great. Lead me to him.
58328,Changed your mind? Decided you want to soldier for the Empire after all?
58330,I've got my eye on you.
58331,"If you think that winning a few battles means you're winning the war, you're even worse at strategy than diplomacy."
58332,"I remember you, you were at Helgen. Speak to Legate Rikke. I suspect we could use someone like you."
58335,"To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed."
58337,I'm sorry...
58340,I trust you'll be finished with Fort Hraggstad soon?
58346,"Better yet, she won't make my head ring the morning after."
58348,"Are you a fool? Look at the bodies around you. Even if you're blind, surely you smell the blood. "
58352,Are you on the hunt?
58353,I'm relieved you discovered a bottle intact; this place looks as though it was ransacked by the orcs.
58354,"Oh, my love. How I long to take her away from all of this."
58356,"Just what we need. City folk barging in, probably looking for an offering to their precious Divines."
58357,"Go, and avenge my Laelette for me."
58358,"Sometimes I miss the Legion, back when the Empire stood up for Skyrim."
58360,"You should do as he says. Go to Malacath's shrine, northwest of here, and ask for his help. See what happens."
58361,Stay where I can see you.
58363,Sybille Stentor has a grasp of magical theory that I would never have expected from a human. Even a Breton.
58364,"You look like the adventurous sort. You should talk to Erik, the innkeeper's son. He could use your help."
58376,"Oh no, that's not it at all."
58377,"Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on your head... a kiss on your cheek."
58378,Do you have news? Did you find something?
58381,"Now, I don't want to alarm you, but there are bandits in these parts. We're safe up here, of course. Just be careful if you're ever here on foot."
58383,"None of 'em's older than nine, and the youngest is six."
58385,Woah!
58387,"Ah yes, Adonato's new work. Shorter than I expected, but words must be judged on merit, not length."
58389,"Another gorgeous gray day, right dear?"
58393,"So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion."
58398,Yeah! Get her! Kill her!
58399,I must've been hearing things.
58400,"Ah, here's the blushing bride now. Let's begin the ceremony."
58401,"Oh, well, um... thank you."
58406,This is no time to play the reluctant hero. You either are or aren't Dragonborn.
58407,"Where's Cosnach, is that lazy idiot out drinking at the Silver-Blood Inn again? On my coin?"
58410,"Amazing, eh? To be standing at the very entrance to Sky Haven Temple itself!"
58411,Go right on in. The party has already started.
58412,"Ahrk fin zul, rok drey kod, nau tol morokei frod, rul lot Taazokaan motaad voth kein!"
58413,The Emperor would turn Skyrim into a puppet of the Dominion. I for one would not care to dance for the amusement of those foul elves.
58417,There's a likely-looking filly. Even if she is an elf.
58419,"Well, look at this. Another city rat crawled outside the walls. I don't suppose you've come up here to tell old Froki about your supposed Divines?"
58420,"Oh, my mistake then. Sorry, you can go on ahead."
58421,"Wait, come back!"
58423,I guess not. 
58428,"Before the Nords came, we worshipped the old gods, had our own kingdom."
58430,"Clever try, scab, but it won't be that easy!"
58431,And now we come to the end of our play. The grand finale.
58433,Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an iniquitous act.
58434,Tell my family I fought bravely.
58435,"Very good. Come, the people await us."
58436,"Suleyki mulaag, Paarthurnax. My power has waxed, while yours has waned."
58437,"Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and my gut's telling me that demented little fool is up to something."
58443, 
58449,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
58450,"Ah, Borkul muscle one out of you on your way in? Fine. Take this one."
58456,I don't even know who they said I killed.
58457,Everything all right?
58461,Pathetic.
58462,Understood... husband?
58463,"This is it. Riften, jewel of Skyrim. End of the road."
58466,Be grateful for what time I give you until then.
58467,"The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks."
58471,"Have you not heard of me? Perhaps I will have my people carve my name in your corpse, as a reminder."
58475,Shor's crown! There are things ladies like us are supposed to do. We've talked about this...
58477,I've got all sorts of weapons for the discerning marksman. What can I get you?
58478,"You have someone already, friend."
58481,And this... This is all wrong.
58483,"We're honest, hardworking folk here, and we don't suffer beggars or thieves. "
58488,Please! Have mercy... I beg you...
58490,"Dean Inge says a bard can never have enough practice. So, would you like a tune?"
58493,"No, not recently at least."
58500,For once you'll actually pay for your crimes.
58501,"Yes, milady. I've also taken the liberty in preparing a private carriage... just in case."
58504,But I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
58506,"Ah, the sneaky type, eh? I think we can fix you right up."
58508,I keep hearing stories about Morrowind. Sounds like a wretched place.
58510,"I'm Sybille Stentor, court mage of Solitude, and according to my scrying you've managed to unleash Potema herself!"
58513,He just couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.
58515,"Since you're so well informed I'm certain you've solved the problem with thermic drift, right?"
58527,"What do you want, Imperial?"
58541,"Take care, now."
58543,"My darling, you've made me the happiest woman in all Skyrim."
58544,But your aunts don't even seem to care. 
58546,"Next problem - Imperial thieves have, yet again, stolen an important resource.  So we're gonna take it from them permanently - by destroying it."
58547,We're taking the capital. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
58548,There isn't someone less busy who can help you?
58549,Malacath himself said this to you? But what does it... Ah! Yes! I see! A ritual is necessary!
58550,"Yes, the Steward is taking visitors. However, I must accompany you at all times while on the royal premises."
58551,"But never mind all that. We're the Emperor's soldiers. We'll do our duty no matter what stands in our way, right?"
58553,I've got my eye on you.
58554,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
58555,"I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it."
58556,"Yes, because a worthless City Orc is just what we've been waiting for. Finally, we're saved!"
58557,"I must protest, my Jarl."
58558,That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not befit warriors like us.
58560,"Please, come back and speak to me anytime."
58561,Curse you for bringing up that bitter memory.
58566,Stop. Turn around. And go back the way you came. Astrid is waiting for you. She's down near the entrance. You must have passed right by her.
58567,But I can't open the door.
58568,I get your point. Tell Iddra I'm sorry for being so stubborn about the coin.
58569,What can I do for you?
58572,I've had enough of you!
58573,The rest of you lot are with me.
58575,You're not afraid you'll set fire to something?
58578,Now get out!
58580,"Present Ri'saad with this satchel of Moon Sugar, and I bet my last septim he'll make a deal."
58581,I can't believe you did that. You people are monsters!
58584,"It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes can sustain you. If you're willing to feed."
58585,And yet none of us can pick a damned lock.
58587,They will become stronger for it. And you... You have proven your strength.
58590,"Yes, old friend, I'm afraid it's not good news."
58591,Stay back or I'll be forced to attack you!
58593,Yearrgh!
58595,Mercer's been storming around waiting for you to come back. I think he's finally figured out who's been messing with the Guild.
58598,Do your worst!
58599,But do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out for you? That remains to be seen.
58600,Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed your oath to the Emperor at every turn.
58601,My boys'll keep you safe. Don't you worry.
58603,I'm in no mood to joke.
58604,I am the hunts-wife of this stronghold.
58606,"Now, down to business. I'm arranging a job for you. But in the meantime, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over."
58607,"If I have to hold your hand through everything, maybe you aren't cut out for this kind of work."
58608,"Maybe this is my chance to make things right. I can finish Malyn's work, the way we had meant to before his madness."
58615,Great. Get back to me when you're done and I'll give you something for your time.
58617,"I know that Thorald's not dead. I just know it. The Imperials have him, and are keeping him somewhere. But I don't know where."
58622,We can't afford to lose our heads... we need to calm down and focus.
58624,"You, an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, have just made an attempt on the Emperor's life. Would have succeeded, had it been the real man."
58627,The poor dear must truly be hungry to comb through rubbish like that. Hope she finds something edible.
58628,"Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh?"
58630,"Grelod, you old crone. You'll get what you deserve. The Dark Brotherhood will see to that..."
58632,"Good work. Here, take this, and keep quiet."
58635,We've got nothing to talk about.
58636,Pfft
58644,The owner of this place just inherited an heirloom from a relative. You want in?
58645,Don't be such a coward. We haven't seen any draugr since the mine was cleared. Be grateful.
58648,Watch yourself.
58650,They say that eating the fruit it bears will add years to your life.
58651, 
58654,"But no matter how poorly they may have treated me, they're still my family. I didn't consider that until after I'd made the trade."
58655,Hsss...Hsss
58656,Toor...Shul!
58658,"Yeah, but don't say anything about it to Froki. I don't think he understands."
58660,Please. Those savages are no match for us. The Jarl is just biding his time.
58662,Ro...Da!
58663,"As they always have, along with those crazed Forsworn. They've driven off the color that used to make this city great."
58664,Um... yeah...
58668,What? Now's not the time to chat.
58670,You should stop by my farm if you get a chance. See what life's really about.
58675,Watch out for pressure plates here.
58682,"Ah... here's the ""blood seal."" Another of the lost Akaviri arts. No doubt triggered by... well, blood."
58686,I'm just trying to make a living. I've no interest in trouble.
58690,Sibbi? He's in prison... you put him there.
58691,"Have you heard? There's been another dragon attack. Kynesgrove, this time."
58694,"I don't know you, and I don't sell what precious property we have to outsiders."
58695,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
58700,Raaarrgh!
58701,Speak quickly.
58706,"If it isn't the slayer of the Glenmoril Witches. How can I assist you, Companion?"
58707,"Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed."
58708,Thanks! I thought I was going to rot in here. So what's the plan?
58721,Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed all the better. But if not...
58723,Indeed.
58726,Nord.
58728,"All my goods are legitimate, which is more than I can say for some."
58729,"If you need a drink, just holler."
58731,"Now wait a minute... No need to do anything drastic. Look, Keep the horse, all right? Then we all walk away happy..."
58733,There's plenty that needs doing.
58735,"Oh, no... No, no, no..."
58744,The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in my life has finally been filled.
58745,"Luckily for you, I've already made the mixture. Here, take it."
58748,I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.
58756,Hist spit on you.
58758,The conquering hero returns!
58759,"Look, if you want arrows we have them, but don't insult my intelligence."
58762,Very well. These specially enchanted gloves will allow you to delve directly into the focal points for these energies.
58764,"If you are not here to grant me a good death, then you can leave."
58765,Get down there and join Rikke on the front line.
58766,"By the Nine, I hate the waiting. The goddamned waiting."
58767,Yeagh!
58770,These graves hold the sons and daughters of Falkreath.
58771,That's a real shame. Gonna make it hard for you to pay a healer after we cave your skull in.
58774,"I don't have much of a reputation in Skyrim yet, but I'm working on that, one sweet lady at a time. Haha!"
58775,A word of warning. Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his research. Getting the information won't be easy.
58776,Are you playing hide and seek?
58777,Thank the gods. I'll get to work on the Phial straight away.
58778,"Pardon me, but do I detect a case of the Rattles? I've got something for that."
58780,I have work if you've got the backbone.
58781,"After that, fear was enough to keep them in line. He could torture and humiliate them and they would not rebel. Even in death, they serve him still."
58783,You and the Jarl will answer for any desecration of my ancestors' bodies.
58784,"My mother's dead, but I won't close the inn. I've hired Leontius to run things."
58785,"Everyone talks, in the end."
58790,"Very good, Thongvor. It relieves me to hear you say that."
58793,"You'd require the Jarl's cooperation, of course. That might not be easy to come by."
58794,I'm prepared to negotiate my surrender!
58799,"Never mind your mother, Hreinn. You listen to me, and you'll be a great man one day."
58800,Because that's... crazy. You do realize who you're dealing with here?
58804,"All right, that's enough. Back to bed, please."
58805,"Well, I don't mean to seem disappointed, but... I just never figured the Gourmet was an Imperial. I had dreamed of something more exotic, maybe..."
58806,I know old men sometimes have pains in their legs when they rise from bed. I know a few spells that could help.
58814,"If it's malachite you're after, you've come to the right place. I'll pay for any you dig up out of Steamscorch Mine."
58819,"Are you all right, dear?"
58820,"Barbas, at your service."
58822,"May I ask what all the honey's for? I mean, you used to buy almost a jar a week. Are you cooking or something?"
58824,Crush the spirit from Logrolf's bones. Make him bend to me.
58831,"You do something out of line, I'll put you down."
58833,Alduin mahlaan
58837,This is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.
58839,It has a few final lines but that's all we needed to add. I need to head to court immediately and present this. You should come.
58840,You have wax in your ears? I said no one dies. We're not assassins.
58841,Don't you think I know that? But these commands come straight from Cyrodiil. 
58843,Heard you had a bit of trouble near Solitude last week.
58844,"We know full well about your investment in shipping ventures, Erikur."
58845,"Aye, I see the look you're giving me. Don't worry, I won't bite."
58846,"Here, take this small token of appreciation for your efforts."
58847,"Ah, this is good. But J'zargo will know them first."
58852,Booooo.
58855,"The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it. Also, never doubt me or Galmar. Now then..."
58859,What is it?
58863,"If word got out that I'm practicing my Dibellan Arts in Riften, they'll run me out of town."
58865,Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.
58869,It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.
58873,"I can handle training one more. After that, I think we'll be ready for a little dragon hunting of our own."
58874,"Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for 8 hours straight?"
58875,"Given the history of this place, it's more than likely there's still some amount of power here."
58877,Then it appears the shadows shroud more than your presence... they blind your wisdom as well.
58878,"You'll make a fine rug, cat!"
58880,"Do what he says, Vex. This isn't helpin' right now."
58881,Let's just say my mother knows which pockets to line and keep it at that.
58886,I'm all ears.
58887,"The Nightingales protect the temple of Nocturnal, a place known as the Twilight Sepulcher."
58888,"Ha! Well it's safely hidden away, in a hollowed-out tree stump. Just outside Riften, tucked away nice and secure. You'll never find it."
58892,I suppose that's a benefit to having so few customers.
58896,"That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes."
58900,Or you could head over to the family and see if they'll let you in. But I wouldn't want to do that myself. Bad luck over there.
58901,"Constance don't care much for strangers in the orphanage. Afraid someone might hurt one of us kids. Which, I gotta admit, is kind of nice."
58902,"The blood calls, sister."
58904,"After that I thought I was turning into a wizard too, because dead things near me would come to life again for while."
58906,You cannot prevail against me. I will outlast you... mortal!
58907,"My mistake. A manservant wouldn't let me starve or freeze. I let you live here, and now I'm two steps closer to the grave."
58909,"Hjerim is a fine house, and it's up for sale. You should talk to the steward in the keep if you're interested."
58912,"Well he don't like company, I can tell you that much. Just wants to be left alone. But no... that's not really it."
58914,"Not so fast, there's a matter of residence to be discussed."
58915,"Now if someone brings me a dragon scale, that's a different story."
58919,"All right, then. We'll get together later."
58923,"Bring the Blackbriar 195 Berry-Blend. It should be at its peak right now, and if it doesn't get served soon, it'll only go bad."
58924,Men aren't good or bad. They're just men.
58925,Ah! A fellow latecomer to Elenwen's little soiree.
58926,Time's up! Better luck next time.
58930,"Writings from that period, including those of Ysgramor himself, do not mention the stones and thus this idea cannot be verified."
58934,Let's get this over with.
58936,"Now that's a smart weapon. Light, strong, useful. Crack some skulls for me."
58938,He's lonely. What do you expect?
58939,I bring death from the shadows!
58941,So exciting when new folk come into town. I bet you've had plenty of adventures.
58944,I'm relieved Brynjolf has an open mind or that could have gotten bloody.
58947,I'm going to stop. That's what I'm going to do! Then everyone will see that I'm not as useless as they think.
58949,Oh. Is that all? Really? 
58952,A group of them has holed up in Hjaalmarch.
58953,Skyrim couldn't be more different from Elsweyr. But magic... Magic's the same no matter where you go.
58956,"Always looking on the bright side, aren't you."
58958,"And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand boy?"
58966,They got archers over there by the fence!
58967,"When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters here to die."
58968,Good. Too many Nords in this town have been listening to Ulfric's narrow-minded words.
58972,Do you seek to make a purchase?
58973,Good. Take this gift. We're even now.
58975,"I'm proud to be your battle-brother, Dragonborn. Whiterun doesn't need to fear with you on our side."
58978,"I wouldn't wander here alone at night. Folk go missing around Chillwind Depths, the cave just over those falls."
58980,The mine gives us purpose. Something many of us have wished for.
58985,Um... I was thinking you might like this. Here. It's nothing really.
58989,"Yes, yes. Let's keep our voices down, all right? Just make sure this gets there."
58990,"The Black Star will never decay, but it can no longer hold the white souls of lesser creatures."
58991,She is the bearer of love and the patron of marriage.
58994,"What'd you pick up there? Oh, I wish I saw that first. You're so lucky!"
58995,"We must go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. We have much to discuss."
59000,"I suppose the Greybeards care about Skyrim's troubles, in their way, but I needed to do something about it."
59003,So you can be helpful sometimes.
59007,"I can't let you do this, mother. You have to die now!"
59008,Might even build a new temple and put Heimskr in charge of it. Hah! I bet he'd like that.
59012,You wouldn't think it from the racket that Cornerclub makes.
59014,"Ahhh... Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters."
59016,"The Blades knew, once upon a time. Alduin's Wall is the key. Yes, yes!"
59017,"Well, aren't you the handsome one. You and I should spend some time together."
59019,"I've spent years watching his techniques and learning his tricks. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be as talented as he was."
59027,"Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an adventure."
59028,"Please, lady. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us."
59029,They are profane creatures with no hope of redemption. They lure innocents to their deaths and corrupt the souls of all they touch.
59032,"Yes, I think that must be it. My wife hasn't been gone that long, after all. Ask me again on another day."
59035,"If you can find him and focus his attention, there's a great deal Drevis can teach you about Illusion magic."
59050,"Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is."
59052,I prefer to arrive early. Often the day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking.
59053,Try and hit the middle target.
59056,"Now that's something else, right there!"
59060,"But I accepted the Dragonborn's invitation to this council, and I at least will negotiate in good faith."
59061,Kill him!
59063,"You must be one of the new apprentices, then? Fine, fine. Just... just don't make a mess of my work, all right?"
59065,Move quickly so we can have this over and done with.
59069,He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of the Voice.
59075,Now we can talk.
59083,This looks like the way out! I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make it.
59084,Were you able to learn anything?
59085,"But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods."
59087,I thought so.
59090,You have your orders. Get moving.
59091,Just not by you.
59092,"Tell me. Why do you come here, volaan? Why do you intrude on my meditation?"
59095,"If someone joins the Forsworn, we haul him to the mines."
59099,"If you can pass the test, then yes."
59100,I have so very many ways to deal with people. Very few of them pleasant.
59102,The Dunmer get their drinks at the New Gnisis Cornerclub. Why they can't just call it a tavern is beyond me...
59103,You can return this axe to our friend. The esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.
59104,"And I'm telling you, you're wrong."
59105,We have to go out there before she disappears again.
59114,Gallus!
59115,Should've known.
59118,I... I'm sorry. I could have sworn I sealed it.
59121,What?
59122,"We have survived difficult times, and are better mages for it. We owe you that, Arch-Mage. Thank you."
59130,"Decided to show up for work today, eh?"
59133,"Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn..."
59134,Last thing the Black-Briars need is some loudmouth tryin' to meddle in their affairs.
59140,"My loyalty lies with Solitude. So where Jarl Elisif leads, I follow."
59141,You're really going to the Blue Palace? That presents an opportunity.
59147,The Stormcloaks will be here any minute! Hurry! Get inside and lock your doors!
59148,You need something?
59149,Suit yourself.
59153,I claim your soul for Nocturnal!
59155,Hey... is someone watching me?
59156,What is it this time?
59162,I have a feeling I'm not going to like what happens when we get back to Clavicus.
59163,A strong drink will chase off that chill in the air.
59166,You should be.
59167,You'll want to watch yourself in Riften. A lot of ways to get yourself in trouble in that town.
59170,It's been forever since I've eaten so well.
59173,"Most women would rather die than dig, but I have a daughter to raise."
59175,Hhyyaarargghhhh!
59176,"He told me once that he wanted me to grow up and be a sailor, 'cause that's where our family name comes from."
59177,What? Something you're still confused about?
59178,Let's see here...
59180,I've been forbidden to deal with you until amends are made with the Guild. Sorry.
59181,"This mine is only a few years old, but I've been digging up ore for over a century."
59184,Rare trinkets and the finest oddities from Morrowind!
59186,"But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it... the Gourmet's special way."
59187,Ah ha.
59189,"Wandered around as a blade for hire. Was a damned good one, too."
59190,"Driven out of my own home. After all this, I can't believe it."
59191,The words.
59192,Khajiit wishes for you to go away. You have done us too much harm.
59195,"I think one of those volumes may have had some relevant information. If you want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn."
59197,Raan...
59198,"Now go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener."
59203,The tenacity of the Imperial Legion is legendary. We need to be ready for them.
59209,They should be back shortly. You're welcome to wait here if you like.
59211,I have. I think we may have to turn this one over to the Dark Brotherhood.
59212,"See if you can't ""convince"" one of those innkeepers to help you."
59213,"And speaking of spoiling Dorthe, who made her a new doll last week?"
59215,"Come on, get up... I need you on your feet."
59216,Lucky then they left behind their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls.
59219,"Don't tell me - Sibbi and Louis Letrush? Well, Sibbi is in jail and Letrush is certainly welcome to try. My hired help is more than a match for him."
59221,"Many of the disgruntled natives of the Reach used the opportunity to depose the Empire, and founded what they called an independent kingdom."
59223,Feel free to look around. We have a fine selection of herbs here at Angela's Aromatics.
59224,I've seen fresh recruits with more skill than you!
59228,"Father, do you want to talk? About mother?"
59232,You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.
59234,There are those who would silence the Dragon's truth! But not I! Not Heimskr! His word will be known!
59235,Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade.
59237,"As we walk these stone passages, we delve into the very bones of the earth."
59238,You're going to Fort Greenwall.
59243,It's coming loose. I can feel it.
59247,That sound... it's deafening!
59248,I'm not going to sugar-coat it for you. We're in a bad way down here.
59258,So be it. We gave you a choice.
59259,"I'm a strict follower of the old traditions. Honor, strength, deeds."
59261,"And don't worry about any rioting, Legate. I have it under control."
59263,"When I heard what Sibbi did, I fled. Now you've found me, and you're going to tell him where I am."
59264,Good. We'll be waiting for you at the stables.
59267,"I do not envy those creatures that make a home in such cold, dark places as this."
59268,"Fight well, don't be a lout, and you'll be fine. You don't need my help."
59271,"Working with the Guild again is the best decision I've ever made. Protection, respect and a constant flow of coin... it couldn't get any better."
59272,"Course there's the Orc. Long-term tenant, that one. For what he pays, I could afford to shut this place down."
59276,Well... maybe not. Dragons haven't been seen in Skyrim for an age or more.
59278,"Well, after a while my father caught on to what I was doing. He confronted me one night and gave me a choice."
59279,"If I can't get you something, I'm sure my wife will bellow at me until I can."
59281,I suppose thanks are in order.
59282,Wonderful. I'll use it to repair the tree. Thank you so much for all your help. 
59283,Crystal....  gone...
59284,"I know the area of the Reach that Esbern's talking about. Near what's now known as Karthspire, in the Karth River canyon."
59286,I grew up tending some of these horses. They're almost family.
59287,I stand where I have always stood. Here in Morthal.
59293,"In exchange, I'm willing to let a few ingots go missing. Maybe more than a few."
59296,See you.
59311,My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you locked up in here with the staff.
59312,"As I said, you will know you are ready when your Voice can open the path to him."
59313,At last! I have searched for this drum for 20 years.
59314,"We might be poor, but is it really any better out there?"
59315,"So, Talen. Have you reconsidered my offer?"
59323,Just... get out of my face. I've got nothing to say.
59324,"I don't know. I think I realized that out in the world, my skills would bring me more wealth as a thief rather than an assassin."
59325,Hmph. I should have known better than to ask a knave.
59326,"Yes, yes, you're entirely brilliant. Conquering madness and all that. Blah blah blah."
59327,You were guided here; you were always meant to be here. That's the way of things.
59328,My daughter was sent to the orphanage there when I stood accused of illegal necromancy. I had no choice. Run or die.
59332,"You're joking, right? Those bone-walkers will tear you limb from limb."
59333,"I'm not sure you belong here, friend."
59336,They'll have set barricades to slow us down.
59342,"You should speak to the Jarl if you need something, stranger."
59343,And here I figured you as one who enjoyed our special gifts.
59344,"When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to."
59350,Keep an eye out for wolves if you're headed up the path to High Hrothgar.
59351,This place will be your tomb!
59353,"You mean, aside from wanting to kill every Blade they can lay their hands on?"
59362,Come back in a few nights when the wedding reception is over and we'll start the ceremony when you do.
59371,"Halt, outlander. By the Code of Malacath, this stronghold belongs to the Orcs. Your kind are unwelcome."
59375,But the Daedra are the worst. Their callous disregard for our lives is abhorrent in the eyes of the God of Mercy.
59376,"Don't make trouble or else I'll ask Dirge to ""walk"" you out."
59377,"But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following Wars of Succession."
59378,"Yes, love?"
59379,Excellent! These things do have a way of working out when people take action. I'll sanctify the remains. 
59380,That's the spirit. Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated.
59382,That would be best.
59386,"Thorald and I have history, all right? We used to be friends. So I looked into it when he disappeared."
59387,Legate. We represent the Emperor here.
59388,Wind guide you.
59391,Morthal will be mine to govern someday. I have a great deal to learn.
59394,Draugr. Dammit. I hate those things.
59398,Didn't muck it up I hear. Good. Here's your share.
59399,Nothing.
59402,"So much for old soldiers settling down to a life of luxury, eh?  "
59415,"Haldyn will take my hide for this, but Skyrim's been feeling a bit confining lately."
59424,Klimmek? What is it?
59427,"Forgive me for worrying about the future of Markarth. The lifeblood of a city is gold, Igmund, and it doesn't stop bleeding because there's a war on."
59430,They die too quickly. Maybe I'll try and hold off on the paralysis next time. Give me more of a moving target. Good practice.
59431,That's because you always lose... Elf.
59432,Blood running hot? 
59433,The thought of my wood being used for weapons... Makes me sick.
59434,...sweet Night Mother.
59437,And then there's a tiny problem with a giant attacking our supply caravans. A giant! As if I didn't have enough to deal with.
59441,"Umm... So, the business is done. This is the last we'll talk about it, right?"
59446,"From all our research, it seems they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine."
59447,Really? I dunno... I don't feel invisible.
59449,"You know, I've heard the Gourmet is in Skyrim right now..."
59450,"A few septims ain't nothing. You can spare that, can't you?"
59451,"""Holding him""? Why I've got him in my cellar. He's my prisoner."
59454,"Too many bother my wife with their petty problems, and then don't even understand the advice she gives them."
59455,"Yeah, he's after Ra'jirr- never seen him so angry."
59456,"I... Yes, I understand."
59459,They drink all day and night and what do I do?
59461,"You an assassin or a thief? Next time, keep your blade sheathed if you want to make any gold."
59463,"Let's go, let's go! Before anyone notices us."
59465,"It's just ahead. Please, keep following."
59469,A man who feels no fear has no heart. I know fear. But it does not control me.
59470,"Ha! The most important question of all, that one."
59475,"True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty man, but he's also a Nord that honors our traditions."
59480,"Well, certainly none of this will benefit my research..."
59485,Might head down to the meadery later. See what they're brewing up. You can smell the honey on the wind.
59487,"I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes."
59490,"When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. Otherwise, mind your business."
59492,And there haven't been any... problems?
59493,"Fine. Next time, save me the trouble and pass on it from the beginning."
59494,"Understood, sir."
59498,You've come at last! I knew you would!
59500,She was... he ripped her apart. Like a sabre cat tears a deer. We barely found enough of her to bury.
59502,"And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray."
59517,We are done talking about this.
59518,"Now, get of my way."
59519,"Now, don't tell my husband, but I don't have any problem with Bassianus."
59522,"Come in, come in. Mustn't speak of these things in the Ratway."
59523,We won't return empty handed.
59524,Take your time then. It isn't as though the Greybeards are going to complain.
59527,Keep your wits about you. The Jarl of Whiterun is known for his temper. 
59529,"Are we alone? Yes... yes... alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan."
59532,"Is that all? My friend, you've come to the right person. You could say that causing a scene is somewhat of a specialty of mine."
59533,The last person that made trouble for Vekel ended up floating in the canal... catch my drift?
59543,What?
59552,Let me know if you want to practice some more. Next time we'll make it a little more challenging.
59553,"I've been doing this a long time, remember? While the Thalmor's been looking for me, I've been watching them."
59554,"The ship travels the northern coast, and sometimes isn't even in Skyrim at all. So you'll have to be patient. Good luck."
59558,I'm bitter because we had lives in Cyrodiil. And we came out here to be paupers.
59563,"I'm warning you, when I get my heart set on something I'm not easily put off."
59564,"Fjola, my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since."
59570,"I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods, you've come to the right person."
59573,"So, um, mind if I buy you a drink?"
59575,"No one has seen or heard from them in over a hundred years now, though."
59576,The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.
59578,You know exactly... no. Not this time.
59584,"Those that shrank from their destiny... well, you've never heard of them, have you?"
59586,Sauranach mine is open again. How am I supposed to handle all this work?
59587,So... Northwatch Keep. Then we know where to hit them.
59588,"Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it."
59590,Let the Dragonborn be the one to do it. 
59593,Clear Skies - combine our Shouts!
59598,You are kind to offer. We believe the bandits are a part of a group headquartered here.
59599,"So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?"
59601,Meals are served to Bards at designated times. Find an inn if you want to make requests.
59602,"Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape the hunt, but only ends up trapping himself."
59603,"I say we go down there and clear the place out, just like old times."
59604,"You wouldn't know it, but before my family got killed? I was the luckiest man in Skyrim."
59605,Don't let me keep you.
59607,"If he wasn't a Black-Briar, I'd march right over to the jail and teach Sibbi some manners... but then I suppose I'd end up like Wulfur."
59609,"I will wait for Loreius! Oh yes, mother and I will wait right here, right here until he fixes our wheel."
59610,You mind swinging that somewhere else?
59611,The Jarl is refusing to dispatch men to the front lines. Do you think it's because of the Forsworn threat?
59618,"So, you wish to master the arcane arts..."
59621,Turns out you're a screw up like the rest. But I still need you. So I'll overlook it for now.
59622,The Stormcloaks are finding victory across the land.
59625,The Guild will not tolerate the kind of behavior you've been displaying. Too much is at stake.
59626,Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar.
59627,We won't give you any more trouble.
59639,Did you see that?
59650,I dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does to its own people.
59652,Take a look.
59656,"Torsten might think Linwe or myself are responsible for Fjotli's death, but I can assure you nothing could be further from the truth."
59657,He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you.
59659,Wow!
59665,"And you'd have me do what, join the College and prance about casting spells all day?"
59668,"Steel's good, but loyalty's better. I'm loyal to Dengeir first and the Empire second."
59671,Mauhulakh's aunts. You know... the way they're all around him all the time.
59672,"This is not play-acting, here. We are the true spirit of Skyrim. Honor is in our blood, death in our hearts."
59674,"By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!"
59676,Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.
59677,Thank you.
59679,"Gods, I'd hate to lose my footing in a place like this. A fall on this stony floor will break bones. "
59683,Business? Business is actually inconsequential to me. I share little of your lust for coin.
59686,"If it will help you, then certainly."
59687,I... I think I need to be done talking for the moment.
59688,But you can bet he'll be trying to figure it out. This could shift the whole balance of the war.
59690,"Peace may yet return to Skyrim. But until then, we fight."
59692,Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back. I will ensure that men from Dawnstar get every opportunity for glory.
59698,"Dear sister, we talked about this sort of thing before. We sell dry goods, nothing more, nothing less."
59700,Those damned Battle-Borns... they know something. They're hiding it. They practically taunt us with it. They must have some sort of proof!
59702,They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron. 
59703,You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!
59705,I am honored.
59706,"So Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see."
59708,We discovered recently that I am with child. I'll need to stop working next season.
59712,And it's clear money matters more to Dagur than honor.
59716,"Not quite good enough, are you?"
59718,Get these things off of me!
59720,"Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready."
59722,Thank you for your patronage.
59725,Ondolemar is the commander of the Thalmor in Markarth.
59727,You're a bad sneak. You're not creeping up on anybody like that.
59729,"What would you have me do, then? Nothing?"
59731,"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
59736,You can't have the Axe! It's all I have left now!
59738,I help in the mines as well as the forge.
59740,"Yes, and I'm also aware of how necessary my divinations and wards have been in the city's defense. My experiments are all I ask for in return."
59744,Get me out of here!
59745,We'll see.
59753,The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
59758,"Not actually a Companion myself, but none of them know how to work a forge properly, and I'm honored to serve them."
59762,"Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting."
59763,Is it safe?
59766,Enjoy your last breath!
59769,Hey! It's the bard-to-be.
59780,There was some bother about a group of mages being exiled. I can't remember what the details were.
59782,The inns at Dragonbridge and Solitude are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
59784,"I've seen better. Well, maybe not."
59785,"Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords flashing."
59786,"I left Winterhold for some time, and returned to stay here at the inn."
59787,You're gonna get me out of here?
59788,"Sigrid! Love of my life! When you get a spare moment, I could use some water."
59790,"When I've finished what I'm working on, everyone will understand its significance."
59792,Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule.
59794,"We sure showed them, eh? Thanks for your part in all that."
59796,Ildene has been working in the Treasury House since before I was born.
59802,The name of the person you want is Karliah.
59805,"There you are! Astrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the ole' ""Choose your victim"" gag with you. Ah, I love that one..."
59807,"Oh, look. A Nordic ruin."
59816,Hmph.
59818,"You will summon a Dremora, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you."
59826,"Hello, my friend? What can I do for you on such a fine day?"
59827,"As Jarl Laila's housecarl, I would ask that you maintain a respectable distance from her at all times."
59833,"If you're an Imperial spy, better turn around right now."
59841,Do these steel walls and strange Dwemer devices make you uneasy? Perhaps it's just me.
59844,Savos. Before... before he died.
59851,"I swear, if I wasn't around, Elgrim would forget to eat his meals. How we make any coin at all is beyond me."
59852,"We got a nickname for anyone who trifles with us guards here in Windhelm - ""Suicide."""
59854,She's been dispatched to... eh... see to it that we get back on schedule.
59855,Ever taken a swim in the Illinalta? Take care you don't get nipped if you do. Folk say it's teeming with slaughterfish. Who knows what else.
59862,So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.
59865,"If you're looking to settle in Riften, there's a house for sale - Honeyside. See the steward in the keep if you want it."
59868,All you ever do is complain about what you want. You're a spoiled baby.
59872,The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
59878,Let's see if I can teach you a few things about using a bow.
59883,My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable.
59884,Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.
59885,"Crazy, naked n'wah..."
59886,But we must have the support of the other Jarls for that claim to have any meaning.
59887,"Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut! Do you know who I am?"
59889,"Say what you will about the dark elves, but they did a proper job with Azura's Shrine. Can see it for miles on a clear day."
59891,Looks like the boss is at it again.
59894,Dead. Something grabbed her from behind. Gone before I could do anything.
59895,Huh. I had heard you died.
59897,"But never mind that, even though you fouled up the job I still think you've got that spark I'm looking for."
59899,Oh what am I going do? I can barely afford to stay at the Bunkhouse.
59903,What's on your mind?
59904,"We cannot go after her, not without drawing attention."
59907,"Sorry, lad... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time."
59908,"Edda, you know well I barely have any coin to call my own. I'm sorry."
59910,"A boy's gotta make a livin', right?"
59911,You're a tricky one. Now fix it.
59913,Suit yourself. You're the boss.
59914,"But, well. Fires go out. Others ignite. Skjor inspired many with his life. Perhaps his death can continue to inspire."
59921,My mother died. Things won't be the same without her.
59922,"You've done a great service to the Silver-Blood family. I've had the Jarl officially pardon you, and taken care of a few other loose ends."
59925,It will pass.
59930,This place is boring. Nothing but the same thing every day. Sigh.
59933,That it?
59937,"Naked. Naked, naked, naked!"
59938,The Eye of Magnus?
59939,"Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this."
59940,And here you are. Champion of Namira. Keeper of her ring. You're everything I hoped you would be.
59942,Well someone has to provide around here.
59943,"No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. Look, we need to keep this quiet... between you and me, okay. No one else needs to know about it."
59944,"I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger."
59945,Halt in the name of the Jarl Balgruuf the Greater!
59946,"Of course! I would do anything for you, my one and truest friend! What do you need from me?"
59947,You must be the new recruit. Welcome to the Legion.
59950,Not a day goes by that I don't think about returning to the ancestral home of my people.
59951,"If all the young people leave, what happens to Ivarstead?"
59952,"I'll explain what I want when I want, got it? You'd already be dead if I didn't like the look of you when you walked in here."
59954,Don't let Ulfric or some of these other short-sighted Nords bother you. Most of us are happy to welcome newcomers.
59955,"This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf."
59956,Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore.
59965,"But then Olfrid got rich an' decided he an his kin were too good for us simple, backwards Nord folk."
59967,This'll teach you not to take things that don't belong to you!
59969,"If she's come this far from home, it must be important. Lead on. I just need to report back to camp by sunrise."
59973,Various shady types I've never seen before. I'd watch my back if I was you.
59974,I do hope the court likes the verse. I think we've done an excellent job of recreating it.
59980,"This woman has endured, has challenged, and has shown her valor."
59982,I'll see you back in Riverwood.
59983,"How did you get that, then? No one's seen them in years!"
59994,"Thank you, my friend."
59995,"At this point, I hardly see how your advice would improve it. It's flawless."
60004,"Don't set anything on fire, all right?"
60013,"He has nothing but disdain for anyone who isn't a Nord. He tolerates us, but that's the extent of his hospitality."
60017,"Sometimes we like to remind a city that we mean business, so we hit it hard. Just steal whatever we can until we've made an impression."
60018,What?
60019,"Now you have my Oghma Infinium. It contains the knowledge of the ages as revealed to Xarses, my loyal servant."
60021,How high the mountains of Skyrim rise!
60023,"That's done it! Look, it's coming to life!"
60025,"Sentinel? That's in Hammerfell, correct? And you say these bracelets are only worn by the nobility?"
60029,"I figure the guards could always use some help, so I keep my eyes open."
60031,We had the best of everything down here... the Ratway was a damn palace.
60032,"You're after that damn hilt? Go ahead, try and take it!"
60033,A new face. And a right fair one at that.
60035,"With a master of magic at your side, you'll have nothing to fear."
60041,I think there were twenty-four in all. Most people keep them as a curiosity.
60042,And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?
60044,No.. get that accursed mace away from me...
60050,"Nice to be here on the home-front. Wouldn't mind being down in Cyrodiil, though."
60052,That'll do. She's all saddled up for you.
60055,Are you new around here? You should go to the inn if you need a place to stay.
60056,I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.
60057,It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.
60059,"Well, some tools that aren't rusted through would be a start."
60060,"Please, enough already!"
60069,"And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?"
60073,You've sent an innocent man to jail. I hope your proud of yourself.
60076,Oh... wait a second. I see what this is. You want me to cut you in or you'll rat me out to Brynjolf.
60078,"Poor Giruad Gemane at the Bards College has been waiting for my latest work, ""Olaf and the Dragon,"" for weeks now. Roads are a mess."
60080,Why are we even going to a wedding at this far flung end of the Empire anyway?
60084,"A gift, Dovahkiin. Toor. Understand Inferno as the dov do."
60086,"Now... if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?"
60088,"Do what you will. Cicero has no fight left. In the end, Sithis will judge us both."
60089,No! Roggi and Kjeld need some more support timbers for the mine.
60092,Khajiit guards your back.
60100,I could run the Skeever! You even said I'm almost as smart as you!
60104,Did you get a look at that thief that they sent to break into the place? What I wouldn't give for a night with her.
60105,Suit yourself.
60106,Yes.
60108,I will thank you not to interrupt me in my tasks.
60111,Got metal to shape.
60114,What are you hunting? Never mind. I don't want to know.
60115,Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter.
60116,You are likely better informed than I.
60118,"I heard tell of a lad in Windhelm. Aventus Aretino. They say he's been doing the Black Sacrament, trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Damn fool."
60119,"You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord."
60120,I'll follow your lead.
60126,I'm on fire!
60130,Ayarg garag gar!
60140,I've thought about that... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber.
60141,Isn't my son Hreinn such a good worker? Not like his father at all....
60144,"Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on."
60146,But they did not trust us. Ni ov. Their inner councils were kept hidden from us.
60149,"No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!"
60162,You like everyone Jorn. You'll make a good court bard some day.
60163,"Why don't you lay down and rest, while we get the meal ready?"
60164,Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg!
60165,"And he's transporting some giant box. Says it's a coffin, and he's going to bury his mother. Mother my eye."
60171,"That's it! You're leaving, right now."
60172,Lo...Sah!
60174,"If you don't watch it, I may actually start to respect you. Job well done."
60176,Good training. 
60179,Poor Cicero. Dear Cicero. Such a humble servant. But he will never hear my voice. For he is not the Listener.
60180,"You will find him holed up at Knifepoint Ridge, where he plays king to bandits and highwaymen."
60181,I'm proud to call a man like you friend.
60188,"Very well. But should the hunger call out to you, I'll be waiting outside Reachcliff Cave."
60189,You don't have time? Fine.
60194,My duty is to guard Brina Merilis.
60195,It's all right. I will not shun you for what you are. Stay. I will tell you everything you have forgotten.
60196,Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim. Give the man my axe. 
60197,Very well.
60202,"By Sithis, I was such a fool. All of this... it's all my fault. You are the best of us, and I nearly killed you... as I've killed everyone else..."
60204,The paltry amount of coin that I place in the charity box at the temple is the least I can do to help.
60205,You're just rotten. No good.
60206,I know you can hear me!
60207,We should keep moving.
60210,Must've scared 'em off.
60217,Hhhhhuuuuuzzzzzaaaaahhhhh!
60218,I hope you're looking at me like that because you want to buy something?
60219,"Now, back to the matter at hand."
60222,I don't need to know if it's fresh from this distance.
60225,"That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks."
60228,Pelagius stopped by and mentioned he hated you. Or I mentioned he hated you and he agreed.
60230,I think by now I've killed one of every living thing in Skyrim. May be time for a trip to Morrowind.
60233,"No escape this time, foul worm!"
60236,May your weapons be sharp and your prey fresh.
60237,"I think you should finish that special assignment Delvin gave you, then we'll talk."
60238,Good.
60239,"I'll allow you the opportunity to turn around, walk out that door, and never come back. I suggest you move quickly."
60240,My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?
60246,What is it now?
60247,"If it's work you're looking for, Hulda's the one to talk to."
60251,Lucky... hit...
60252,Nobody here now.
60254,May the sun keep you warm even in this land of bitter cold.
60261,I know now that I can't live among people.
60266,"Every time I think of you, I imagine a Saber Cat closing its claws around your face."
60267,"Exactly, Bulfrek. You always know your place."
60272,"Well, you are lovely to look at, and there's so many things I could teach you, but I'm afraid the Temple isn't taking in new students."
60277,Time to... finish this!
60279,It'll do you good! Maybe you could visit Irgnir or Fruki on your way out? I've seen them looking at you when they come in for drinks....
60285,"If you've never been to Riften, be sure to visit the Black-Briar meadery. A few mugs of that and you'll forget all about the long trip."
60286,Do you still need me to do something?
60289,"They have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage."
60290, 
60291,Your efforts are in vain. It has already begun.
60293,Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil. 
60294,Aaaaagh!
60295,"Well? Spit it out, mortal. I haven't got an eternity!"
60299,You have a death wish?
60300,"Hahaha! You have much to learn of the dov, then."
60301,"I have a decent mind for potions, but I've also learned how to craft magical items."
60303,You've not seen the night sky until you've seen it on the open sea.
60305,You may even be my champion. Perhaps. 
60307,"Always good to see a fellow traveler. I hope you've found the roads relatively safe. Free from dragons, at the very least..."
60311,They didn't put up much of a fight. All that was left were the women and the children.
60312,"Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it."
60320,Having another port would ease our supply situation considerably...
60328,Go talk to Vex. She'll tell you the why's and how's if you want to get back in.
60330,I remember old Arnleif building each shelf in this store himself.
60331,"Can you close up the stand early today, mama?"
60332,"If you're looking for Ranmir, he's either passed out in bed, or working on winding up that way."
60334,I was a member of the court during the reign of Torygg's father. It was Torygg who appointed me to the position.
60336,"Quite. To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it."
60338,Of course.
60339,"I've no problem with your kind, Orc. But that stronghold you've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people."
60348,"Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself."
60349,"After the so-called ""battle"" of Pale Pass, the Akaviri went into his service. This was the foundation stone of the Second Empire."
60356,The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
60362,"No objections, then? Good. Go now. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn."
60369,I think Bryling's the one you want to talk to. I'm mostly just here to scare away the riff raff.
60374,"If you're looking for extra work, talk to Vex or Delvin. They'll fix you up."
60375,"Oh, I wouldn't be able to help them. Their skills were given by the Divines."
60376,Yah...Nir!
60378,Krah Diin!
60381,"Yeah, sure."
60384,What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?
60385,Kaal!
60393,Very little. It's an uncertain time. 
60394,"She... really? That's... I wouldn't have dreamed. Of course, we need her in Markarth, then. I'll come with you."
60395,"You speak to a Vigilant of Stendarr. Cavort with any Daedra, and we will hunt you down."
60398,"Look, I was saving this, but I wanted you to have it. I thought I might need it if Sapphire came for me, but I don't need it anymore."
60399,Lun...
60401,I'll think about it.
60403,Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons.
60404,"If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods involve secrecy and discretion."
60405,All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.
60406,You'd best hurry it up.
60407,Enough!
60408,Faas!
60411,Su!
60416,Raan!
60417,Tiid!
60418,"And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open, friend!"
60419,Fo!
60420,Hsss
60423,If only Maven would stop raising the price on it maybe I could afford to stock more cases.
60425,That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
60431,Perhaps you should let a father decide what is best for his own son.
60435,I feel the same. I do not think Khajiit were made for the cold.
60436,Agh! I been wounded worse by better!
60437,No!
60438,"Afraid I'll cause another scene, I suppose..."
60441,For Skyrim!
60443,Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.
60444,It was during the war with the Empire that I was at the height of my power. As a Thalmor battlemage I laid waste the enemy.
60446,Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.
60447,You're a slave. Just like us.
60448,Did he tell you what you wanted to know? Did he teach you the Dragonrend Shout?
60453,You again?
60464,Gah...
60465,Do you remember the Legion? Fighting the Thalmor in the Great War?
60468,"If I make it back to Solitude, I'll put in a good word for you with General Tullius."
60470,They are good women. They love me. You will speak no more ill of them.
60472,So what's your story? Just here to... relax?
60473,"I don't like taking orders from a boy, but I need the gold."
60475,"I desired stealth and secrecy, but you executed the task with as much subtlety as a enrage mammoth. "
60478,"But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the Thieves Guild where it hurts."
60480,Eola is a fine host. She really keeps the faithful together.
60484,"New to Riverwood? If you're looking for work, go see Hod at the mill."
60485,"Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, woman, why?"
60486,"Ah ha ha! You mortals and your frail, limp, pathetic bodies. Try it again."
60488,Let's make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage?
60489,Hahaha!
60491,Watch what you're doing.
60492,Put that down.
60497,Hmph.
60499,"Speak, elf."
60500,This is just what I need right now.
60501,Good evening.
60503,What do you want?
60505,"Yes, yes. I haven't got all day..."
60507,"Mehrunes Dagon, the Lord of Change, we have brought your Razor to you. We beg you, please bring the blade's full glory to Tamriel again!"
60508,"Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth."
60509,It's probably for the best anyway; I'm far better at fishing than working in a meadery.
60510,Loyal? Thongvor supports Ulfric and his Stormcloaks! We should imprison the entire family as a precaution.
60511,Out with it.
60517,Y...Yes?
60518,I have a choice?
60521,"I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin. "
60522,Redguard.
60526,"There have been whispers. A boy, up in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Been trying to contact... the Dark Brotherhood."
60531,It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. 
60532,"Agallon is an efficient man, and will certainly already have begun his tour of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we don't have his schedule."
60533,Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Lucan.
60534,"Beware of Frostmere Crypt, friend. Heard some bandits are living in the ruins now."
60535,"Magic is a true power, not something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion by politicians."
60541,But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.
60546,"You don't have to say anything. There's no need. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract."
60547,"I understand he settled down in Hjaalmarch, and his presence there caused something of a problem."
60548,Good. Glad we straightened that out.
60550,I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.
60551,But those are the words. The Binding Words. Written in the Keeping Tomes. The signal so I would know. Mother's only way of talking to sweet Cicero...
60552,I guess there's nothing for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help.
60553,"I hoped to avoid involving them in this, but we have no other choice."
60554,Have you ever heard of a Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
60556,Feim...
60558,"I'm fine, Horik. I just... are you worried about this war?"
60559,"Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've come to an agreement."
60560,"Patience, my dear. The Akaviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism."
60562,"If you find that ring, bring it here."
60563,We'll see.
60564,Aye.
60568,"Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history."
60570,Good morning.
60571,I'm ready. Let's go.
60572,"More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last set of contracts I gave you. Why don't you concentrate on eliminating that final target."
60573,"Can't talk long, got to keep my eyes open for Mercer."
60575,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
60576,"See, now that's what I'm talking about. Working hard, making your mark on this world. Good job, son."
60578,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
60579,"We stay together, no matter what. Agreed?"
60581,"But wherever that dragon came from, and whatever it wants, Ulfric will get to the bottom of it. You can count on that."
60583,Wait! That's not how this is supposed to work!
60584,"What's this? Oh, that's right, the timbers from Anga's Mill."
60586,Yeah? What's your problem?
60587,"If you want to help stop that dragon, your best bet is to go to Solitude and join up with the Legion."
60588,"I don't blame you for being angry about it. I would be, too, in your shoes."
60589,But it was all a mistake. You weren't supposed to be on that cart with those Stormcloak traitors.
60592,"I... well, let me think about it."
60594,Suffering to all mankind!
60595,Show up these Imperials for the foreigners they really are.
60596,"Unfortunately, one needs to be able to cast at least Apprentice level spells in any school of magic before being allowed to join the College."
60598,"Reburrus, there is a war being fought across all of Skyrim, and you bother me with the usual mundane reports about silver?"
60600,None can stand against the Wolf Queen!
60601,"That's disgusting, get that rotting carcass away from me!"
60602,Keep this up and you'll be rich enough retire before you know it. Good luck.
60607,"Care to try out a new ring, or perhaps my daughter could make you a necklace..."
60610,"Okay, there you go."
60612,"Lad, I know what you've been up to."
60617,So what do you want to know?
60618,"The road to Whiterun's not safe these days. Lots of travelers just... disappear, south of Dragon Bridge. Can't find a trace of them."
60619,Open to the will of Septimus!
60621,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
60624,"Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one."
60627,You want a cut of venison or mutton? Of course you do.
60629,Going straight through or did you want to stop somewhere along the way?
60632,Silence will serve us well in this place. Let us take our foes by surprise.
60633,He... he tried to kill Margret. Right in front of me.
60634,We're almost there. Windhelm's just ahead.
60635,We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.
60637,Our son or daughter isn't going to get much Redguard culture here in Skyrim. I know my wife worries how she will pass along her traditions.
60638,Hold your breath if you're superstitious. We're passing Shroud Hearth Barrow. Everyone knows spirits guard the old treasure there.
60639,You ever hear the one about the Breton and the bear-tamer?
60640,"I used to play in the Yorgrim River when I was just a boy. It's true! I was never afraid of the stories about Forsaken Cave, of course."
60643,There's Treva's Watch. I hear bandits moved in while the steward was off fighting the war. I wonder if he ever got that sorted out?
60644,"Leave this shrine, blasphemer, before I kill you for defiling Azura's artifact."
60646,"Thalmor got their embassy up that way. If I had my way, the lot of those yellowback elves would wake up in a box back to Summerset tomorrow."
60647,Just stay out of the Black-Briars' affairs. You'll live longer.
60652,"I'll anoint you with the symbol of the wolf, the crab and the skeever. This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair."
60653,"Aerin, have you seen my ring? The one with the inscription?"
60654,"You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne."
60655,"They're stolen idols! Imposter gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials."
60658,Ouch! Hey!
60665,You certainly have a strange energy about you. I look forward to following your progress.
60666,"I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and now it seems you help the Empire at every turn."
60668,You left this back there. Figured you'd be wantin' it. Here ya go.
60669,"Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood, and Astrid was just a ""pretender."""
60670,"You left this over there. You want it back, right? Here."
60671, 
60673,Be very careful with that. It sounds as if it may be the Death Ring of Dro'farahn. A ring of the most dangerous sort.
60676,"He's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside."
60677,"I see... Well, the Legion will still be here when you change your mind. Rikke believes in you. And I'm starting to see why."
60678,I don't see 'em any more.
60679,Deliver your report to Legate Rikke.
60680,Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
60684,Ru!
60685,"So you do. Thank you, this will help quite a bit."
60686,"Studies stars you say? Why, there hasn't been a mage doing anything related to stars since.... Oh...."
60688,"Yes, my lord."
60689,Already did.
60692,"Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to see another Guild brother down here."
60694,"You always keep us in mind when you need a fresh horse, yeah?"
60695,This place is filthy. I've a mind to cancel all town privileges unless those brats start pulling their weight.
60696,"This doesn't concern you, friend."
60697,You must leave immediately.
60699,You should be talking to my Steward.
60702,I don't like the looks of this place... not at all.
60711,The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again.
60712,"Oh, no no no! No mistake at all. What you made was a choice. Granted, not a very wise choice, but these things happen. Ah, the folly of youth..."
60714,There's no need for that.
60715,"Whiterun, home of the Skyforge. It is said a blade forged in its fires can cut through sinew as if it were parchment."
60719,"Please, tell me you've found the crystal. I've no wish to die in this place."
60723,Protect the Jarl with your lives!
60724,Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?
60729,Halt in the name of the Jarl Hrongar.
60730,That's close enough.
60732,"We follow you, hunt-master."
60733,"The Silver-Blood family own half the Reach, and they won't stop until they own all of it."
60735,Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up with you before long.
60737,"This one time only, I'll grant you special immunity for any past transgressions, real or perceived."
60738,Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped.
60739,"I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong."
60740,Yes. Further. Into the bowels.
60741,Ever since I took over as the foreman the production of our mead has never been more profitable.
60746,Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead.
60747,All hail the Dragonborn! Hail him with great praise!
60749,"Fine, leave me to die."
60750,"Harpies, every one of them."
60752,May the blessings of the Nine be with you.
60754,"Please, help Avulstein if you can. Something has to be done, or we're all going to lose our minds."
60756,"In fact, just about anyone who isn't a Nord is fair game for their bullying."
60757,We even have a celebration planned for you.
60759,What's he digging around in there for?
60760,"Come on now, watch the footwork. Keep your balance."
60764,Must you keep stopping?
60765,"I serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary. Life is simple, and good."
60766,"Is that so? Well then, I'll have to charge you with disturbing the Jarl's peace."
60768,He would ask that it please not happen again.
60770,My point exactly.
60773,"So I hear. Come here, you."
60777,Did you hear something?
60779,"Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. Please, everyone. Enjoy."
60780,"Well now, how is Astrid doin' these days, uh? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up."
60781,"You're the one who conspired with the Forsworn against Markarth! You're coming with me, murderer!"
60783,"You ready, auxiliary?"
60786,Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor. 
60787,The rest of my men are already assembling outside Korvanjund. I'll meet you there as soon as I finish up here.
60792, 
60793,One of you get in here! I could put all of you down!
60795,Why does everyone ignore me? Why do you turn your heads? Why will no one help me?
60796,What are you waiting for? I know you want to kill me. Now's your chance!
60797,Nepos is in charge. That's all I know.
60798,I smell blood.
60802,The Thanes have every confidence in General Tullius's leadership.
60803,Is there any news from High Rock?
60805,We'll see about that.
60806,I'm just here to clean up.
60807,Hey! That's my sword.
60808,Hey! What's this?
60809,Fire!
60810,Fiend! You will not leave here alive! Guards! Guards!
60813,"So, what book should I read to you tonight?"
60821,What's that you said? Dragonborn? Then... there really is hope after all?
60823,And no doubt you're one of them. Leave me alone!
60824,"I knew, that day, that it was truly the beginning of the end."
60828,"Yes. I'm your friend, and I've invited you to dinner."
60829,The silence became almost... maddening.
60830,"Serving as Steward to Ulfric Stormcloak was a great honor, but I don't miss his temper."
60832,This doesn't look good.
60833,Come back here!
60834,Talen! Another round!
60839,You clean out that muck?
60840,"Sure, my voice could use a rest."
60842,You brought this on us! You!
60844,"By Ysmir, you won't leave here alive!"
60845,Evenaar bahlok. There are many hungers it is better to deny than to feed.
60846,"Take it easy, Vekel. How long we known each other? Yeah. I checked it. All the stuff is in the safe."
60847,Come on! We've got to find a way out of here!
60849,Very much so.
60852,"You always were a fool, Ulfric. You're no better at diplomacy than you are on the battlefield."
60853,"The walls of Markarth may be high, but their age will have created weakness or secret entrances. Find them!"
60858,Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
60861,I wish she would. At least that way she'd have people to talk to.
60862,"Paying the wages yourself? Well, I won't say no to gold. By my family's honor, this money will go to the Argonian workers."
60863,"Farewell, Enthir... words can't express..."
60864,I thought we'd talked enough. Unless you've reconsidered my offer? That Cicero needs sortin'...
60870,Onward to our next adventure!
60871,"So. You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want."
60873,"So fine, trudge off to Labyrinthian in search of your Staff. I shall return to Cyrodiil and deliver my full report to the Council."
60874,Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
60875,Is it daylight out? Night? I lose track down here.
60877,Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal.
60878,"I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!"
60879,Malacath blesses this land for the Orcs. And the Orcs alone.
60880,"Mind yourself in my city, lass. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight..."
60882,Fjola?  How do you know that name?
60883,"Well, well. Hello there, big man."
60884,For the Blades!
60885,I'd constructed a meager shrine to Mara in the antechamber where we entered.
60888,"So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?"
60890,"Ah, no. Don't think you've got the stuff. Come back when you've seen a bit more in life, perhaps."
60891,"Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as perhaps I should have."
60892,That's not for you to decide. Soldier.
60894,I wouldn't have sent you in the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it. Now then...
60896,Slen!
60900,"You wouldn't attack an old woman again, would you?"
60901,The Bloodmoon lights the way.
60902,Show us the path to the prey.
60903,"Very well. You, outsider, come here! I want a word."
60904,Come on!
60910,Some folk - they got no shame.
60911,"When the top level was built, no more could be placed. It was and is the maximal apex."
60915,"I am sorry if I disappointed, Harbinger. Still, the battle was won."
60916,Hello. Welcome to the Pawned Prawn.
60918,Why? I want to watch the soldiers.
60919,The blood of Markarth is silver.
60920,"Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling."
60924,You know you're not supposed to be in here right now.
60926,I'm Captain Aldis. I'm here to help you take down these bandits.
60928,"New in town, eh? Here for the fishing I'd guess."
60929,Someone with connections to our Guild wants us to hit this place and send a message by clearing it of valuables. You want to handle it?
60930,I wish Galmar would hurry it up. We shouldn't be here.
60931,The owner of this place just got an inheritance from a relative lost in the war. Sound like something you can sink your teeth into?
60933,"Please hurry, I have only a few bottles left!"
60934,"Bassianus wants to marry me. And I think I love him. But he wants to move to Riften afterwards, and my father won't allow it."
60935,"There's an axe. An incredibly powerful axe. An axe powerful enough for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed."
60938,"Really? Power? You're a dragonborn; you already have more power than most people who aren't immense, fire-breathing monsters."
60939,"We don't know you, and we don't want you here."
60940,"Good. This is Skyrim, and we should honor the old ways. These foreigners don't even respect their own gods, much less Kyne and her Sacred Trials."
60941,The roads of Skyrim lead to many dangers.
60944,"You've been here for a while, right? What was it like back when we could still make runs out to the coast?"
60945,"Hmph. How about, instead of giving you another contract, I simply deride you for not finishing the one you still have?"
60947,But strength doesn't hurt.
60948,We're in this together. Stay close.
60949,I thank you for your kindness. 
60950,"You really should put on some clothes, you know."
60951,"That we are superior to men is an established fact. For example, take this belief in Talos. The ""ninth"" divine. Heh."
60958,That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control.
60964,"You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something. Will you hear me out?"
60966,"Die, damn you!"
60970,Am I going have to beat it out of you? Is that what you want?
60971,"What do you need, guardian?"
60975,"Pirates, you see."
60978,Well? Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
60979,I'm afraid that concludes our business. You have exhausted all available additional contracts.
60983,Mama doesn't think I'm girlish enough. But that's just stupid girl talk.
60986,"Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not deal in mere ""pranks."""
60990,I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies.
60991,"I am not ""up to"" anything. I apologize if I have offended in any way."
60994,Don't know anyone here doesn't have Rattles or Ataxia.
60995,"Our sweet Lady is maiden, mother... and crone..."
60998,"Also, I recommend hitting the training room if you need lockpick practice. Helped me out of a jam more than once."
61000,"You're in the wrong place to be asking those kind of questions, pal."
61001,"You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook."
61003,So where is it? 
61005,"I would... eh... be interested in acquiring it. If you're willing to part with it, that is."
61007,"Yes. Kill the chef, and then steal his very identity. For that is the true death."
61011,I am grateful to have the life that I do now. It is a far cry from my days as an orphan on the streets of Corinthe.
61013,I'll... get you!
61014,Grrargh!
61018,Ever tried taking care of children? It can be a nightmare.
61020,Of course.
61021,"One of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy."
61022,"Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even existed. Did you run into any trouble?"
61023,"I don't know what persuaded you to assist me when we met in Dawnstar, but I'm glad you did."
61028,Gerdur!
61029,"They're shrewd traders and don't mind getting their hands dirty. I've bartered with their leader, Ri'saad, on more than one occasion."
61030,For that price? Sure.
61031,"I still almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon..."
61032,I'm a true Nord. Simple as that.
61034,Is someone there? Stay back! I don't want to attack you.
61041,"Elsweyr is an arid land of deserts and rocky canyons, where the sun shines warmly, always."
61042,We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny.
61043,They challenge us to be our best.
61044,"As Whiterun's priest of Arkay, I spread his word whenever I'm able. In the meantime, most of my hours are spent with the city's dearly departed. "
61045,That I am. My father left it to me after he died in that Great War against the Elves.
61048,Hyargh!
61049,Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star.
61052,And you did just that! I haven't been so entertained in at least a hundred years.
61055,You acted very nobly in helping my master realize his life's work. Thank you for that.
61056,"I'll always be a commander, even if those Stormcloak dogs have stripped away my power."
61059,"We heard the news at Cloud Ruler by courier, riding hard from the Imperial City."
61061,Aaah... yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind.
61063,"What? Oh gods, I don't want to die..."
61064,"I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims."
61065,I just said that to make the poor guy feel better. I'm pretty sure she's dead.
61066,"Yeah, yeah. Goodbye, kill lots of people, Hail Sithis, and all that."
61068,"Greetings, fellow hunter."
61070,"I'm not seeking advice right now, friend. Just send the message."
61072,"I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move on."
61073,"I understand you purchase used goods, as well as sell them?"
61074,I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
61076, 
61078,"The Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Close to the road, but away from prying eyes."
61080,"I don't have anything for you just yet. Please, talk to Nazir, and see what he has available."
61082,"To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting."
61083,What are you waiting for? My husband is out there somewhere with that lunatic. Find them! Do what you've been tasked to do!
61089,"Psst. Hey, I know who you are. Hail Sithis."
61091,"I can tell you're a discriminating customer. Perhaps you're a wealthy one, too, hm?"
61092,"Qostiid sahlo aak. Just because you can do a thing, does not always mean you should."
61093,I used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.
61094,"Yes, Listener?"
61095,We must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the Guild.
61096,Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!
61100,I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
61101,"Find Savos, and get him back here if you can!"
61102,I hope Arkay grants my wife some comfort. Thank you. Here. I always pay my debts.
61104,Do you think that dragon is still flying around here somewhere?
61107,Can't say I've heard of any laws against... whatever that is you're doing. But I'll lock you up if I have to.
61110,"I am yours, Listener."
61113,"I just often don't have much to do, so I tend to... I try things out. They don't usually work, but I try."
61115,"Fine armor you've got there. Dwarven make, am I right?"
61116,"Magic? Goodness, not here! Nothing dangerous like that! That's all kept to that College up in Winterhold."
61117,This is not the time to keep Astrid waiting.
61118,Morthal has enough problems without you bothering me.
61119, 
61120,"I used to work at Anga's Mill, but I... I had to leave."
61121,Sigh. You win. Tell Shadr he can forget the debt.
61122,Have you scried anything new in the entrails?
61123,"Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, he's in there!"
61124,"You're not actually... picking my pocket? Well, you've got guts. I'll give you that."
61126,There's an entrance to it in the basement storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over.
61127,Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?
61128,"Not here. Definitely not here. You want to learn, join the College in Winterhold. They'll deal with it."
61129,Hunh!
61131,You weren't. There's just not much to it.
61132,I have no time or patience for a student. Perhaps the College of Winterhold will grant you admission.
61137,"Fine, but you're not gettin' any wealthier by weaslin' out of everythin' I offer you."
61138,I have a prison to run.
61139,"But if there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the ring back. That was one of my best pieces."
61141,"The rumors were true... I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it."
61145,"Long ago, the Empire used the city to garrison troops who guarded the passes to Morrowind."
61146,"Yes, my friend. Though no one has been able to get close to her for as long as I can remember."
61149,Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail between his legs.
61151,Changed your mind I hope?
61152,I'm ready. More than ready.
61153,Hmm. We could use the time to bring in new recruits. Our losses have been heavy recently...
61155,Is that an Amulet of Mara? I'm surprised someone like you isn't spoken for.
61158,I suppose you have another question?
61159,"Just one right now, actually. "
61160,But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?
61161,Can't you bother me at my armor stand in the market? Or are you that desperate for training?
61163,You'd never think to learn from a Nord like the Jarl's wizard.
61164,"Look, I'm done here. Mop the floor with these idiots for all I care. Just get out of my way."
61168,But you don't need to share the worries of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery!
61171,Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all very eager to meet you.
61173,"I took that prancing fool into my home, and this is how he repays me?"
61174,(bark)
61175,"I am yours, mistress."
61176,We live by his code and follow his teachings. An outlander like you wouldn't understand.
61177,"Ready when you need me, Listener."
61179,What are you starin' at?
61181,"Here, some gold as promised, and let me show you a bit about wearing heavy armor. Save you some aches on a long march."
61184,Well now. Funny you should ask.
61185,"I need a Daedra's heart, at once! Quickly, quickly!"
61186,Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses.
61188,"Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill... that you stole."
61192,Then they should send one they consider worthy. 
61194,"With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor."
61195,"These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say."
61198,I don't even want to know what it is you've been doing.
61205,"Everyone thinks I'm too young to be a ship's captain, but I'm going to prove them wrong."
61207,Who I am really isn't as important as what I am. And what I am is an admirer. Of sorts. 
61211,What is it?
61213,"I feel so helpless out here. The people of Riften depended on me, and I failed them."
61219,How many Nords died to save the Empire? And what was our reward?
61221,"Still, a little knowledge of plants and potions can get you by. Not that anyone likes to admit buying things from you."
61222,How could you? Just go.
61224,Spare a bite for a poor old veteran?
61228,"We don't anticipate any real violence, but it never hurts to be prepared."
61229,"Your targets are a dark elf wizard named Maluril, in the dwarven ruin of Mzinchaleft. And Helvard, the housecarl of Falkreath."
61230,Except the ones attacked by Forsworn.
61231,"There's Deekus, a shipwreck scavenger. Ma'randru-jo, a traveling caravaner. And Anoriath, a hunter."
61232,Leave me alone.
61235,Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.
61237,"Well then, your timing couldn't be better."
61239,I suppose so. I just fear they won't make it out here in time.
61241,Where is that lazy man?
61246,"But I'm sure you've got plenty to keep you busy right about now, hmm?"
61247,We also must make an effort to avoid worsening what Skyrim thinks of us.
61251,But I digress. Here's your payment.
61252,"Don't worry, my friend, I'll spare you the facetious quip about killing a defenseless old woman."
61256,"I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries."
61257,"Those caravaners can be an elusive bunch. Takes a fair bit of stalking to take one down. But then, that's half the fun, isn't it?"
61260,If you find any more candidates bring them here. 
61261,All right!
61266,"This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable."
61267,"As a matter of fact, I do. Two of them. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge."
61269,I hope this is important... I get little sleep as it is.
61272,Aduri is what some would call a free spirit. She likes to wander the fall forest for hours on end.
61273,I've tried to explain that Roggvir did something bad and that we all have to be accountable for our actions but... a child feels what she will.
61274,Now what did you want? I already paid you.
61275,We got the message... now just take your business elsewhere.
61276,Me? Ha! Are you serious?
61278,"So I've heard. Thanks to you, this should be the last time they forget to pay."
61280,Explore the facets of the infinite jewel. 
61281,She came by so Alva could kiss her goodbye.
61282,Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have left!
61286,"Well, well... color me impressed, lad. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!"
61287,"But heed my warning - the Blades may say they serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have."
61291,By you?
61294,Speak with Nazir and see if he has any contracts available. I need time to read Motierre's letter.
61296,"Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?"
61297,"I wasn't sure that he'd see the light, but I'm sure you ""explained"" it to him. Well done!"
61298,"What, did you suddenly grow a conscience? Suit yourself."
61305,I owe Thorald my life. Helping to save him is the least I can do.
61307,"You must be the... assassin. I need you to kill the Itinerant Lumberjack, in Morthal, at the logging camp. Here, this is all the gold I have. "
61309,"Of course, dear. Of course. And, from what my little ravens tell me, you handled yourself quite well."
61310,Whatever it is those Psijics are up to. They cannot be trusted.
61311,"We're the ones he loves. Me, and you."
61312,Of course! I've seen you at the Flagon. My mistake.
61313,"That Wisp Essence didn't help, but maybe this will."
61315,"Awaken, and perish!"
61316,Only twenty septims a bottle!
61317,"It's an old city. Legends say Dwarves built it first. Then after they vanished, the natives moved in. "
61318,Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time.
61320,"Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused... and they say I'm mad!"
61321,The Jarl is not to be disturbed with common affairs of court. You direct those concerns to me.
61323,"Oh come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?"
61327,I have silver to bend.
61328,Picking through garbage. Has he no shame?
61329,"You and me, we're the only people around who aren't complete fools."
61331,"I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Sister."
61332,You have a grim look.
61334,My mind is on my experiments today. What did you need?
61335,"To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness."
61336,Fine. Take it!
61339,Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass.
61340,Gods strike you down.
61341,My favorite drinking buddy. Let's get some mead.
61343,"Well, look at you. If only everyone acted like you did."
61345,All right. Don't take too long.
61346,"Good day, friend! Keeping well?"
61347,Worthless. Everyone like you is completely worthless.
61348,"You wear that Stormcloak armor well, friend."
61349,"Will I teach you, Dovahkiin? What Word calls you to deeper understanding? There are three to master: Fus, Feim, and Yol."
61350,I'm bored! Let's play a game!
61352,I bet you could slay one of those mean old dragons. I bet you could do anything.
61353,The gods know what you've done.
61354,"Yes, child. Nana Ildene has taken care of the Silver-Bloods for many years...."
61355,"May the gods watch over your battles, friend."
61356,"There's an apothecary in town, yeah. But it's down on the lower walkway, so stay sharp if you go down there."
61357,You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
61360,"For your crimes, may Malacath boil your blood and grind your bones."
61363,We should get moving. There's no time to waste.
61364,It annoys us. What does it want to take from us now?
61365,Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here!
61366,"I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over."
61367,"And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life."
61368,"Well, then. Repeat after me."
61370,Khajiit.
61374,"So, you're Brynjolf's new protege, eh? Don't look like much to me."
61375,"An assault. On my watch. By the gods, he'll not get away with this."
61377,You kiddin'? My brother Dirge works in their hideout.
61378,I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. They've never had many problems with the Empire.
61382,"I know who you are, assassin. I guess the rumors about your kind's ""extinction"" have been... exaggerated."
61384,That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.
61386,You could learn Dragonrend from those who created it.
61387,Ahhh... It's good to be home.
61388,That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.
61389,I trust that you'll inform me as soon as the Staff is recovered.
61394,"Well. They've been hunting down Blades since the Great War, on general principle."
61395,I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
61396,Don't you need my help?
61398,That's not necessary. I'll pay the same price as anyone else.
61399,That Cicero feller?
61400,"Huh. Not sure. I don't worship Talos, myself."
61401,That's what I thought.
61406,You don't look like a pilgrim. Why bother visiting Ivarstead?
61411,"I wish I could make my deliveries more often, but the road's getting dangerous."
61412,"Out of my way, or I'll cut you. Deep."
61414,Hmm?
61415,"I spent years looking for what became of the ship, but I ended up empty-handed."
61416,I'm glad to be out of that place. I hope this leads somewhere.
61421,"His path will cross yours in time, but first you must find that which you need."
61426,"Ugh. Get this awful paper away from me, by Talos!"
61429,"If you're here about the nightmares, I'm afraid my pleas to the College of Winterhold go unheard."
61430,Is Hert his sister or his wife? Or both?
61431,I don't know if that's such a good idea...
61434, 
61439,It's a fine day with you around.
61440,"Just follow my instructions, and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you... Listener."
61444,Thank you! I can promise you that this will be put to good use.
61450,That's what I wanted to hear. Good luck out there.
61455,"Yeah, we're all looking for something."
61456,I'm afraid it's going to be a while before I can get any more Goldenglow Honey.
61457,"I own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
61458,You have the ring. All you have to do is pick Brand-Shei's pocket and plant it there.
61459,Hhhhhhhaaaaaa!
61461,"I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true daughter of Skyrim here today."
61462,Here. 
61464,"You idiot. He said ""firs"" not ""furs."" It was a damn logging caravan!"
61465,"Ah, well. Dead is dead. Right? My thanks to you, assassin. Here's the gold I was going to pay for the job. You earned it, after all."
61466,"This is a private home, and the master of the house is a very old man. He's not to be disturbed."
61467,"The Dark Brotherh... Oh. Oh! I... my goodness, you're really here! The Black Sacrament. It actually worked?"
61468,Sister.
61470,"Ah, it's my love, come to visit."
61473,"What do you need, love? Ask anything."
61474,She is likely not using her true name. We will pay for any information regarding her location.
61475,"Next, you'll infiltrate their position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows."
61476,Zii...Gron!
61477,I believe you know what needs to be done. Something about putting out a fire?
61480,Yes? What is it that you want?
61482,The first line is the walls around this city and the men who patrol them.
61485,"These days, it seems there is dread everywhere, whether it be war or dragon. But I beg you - here, today, put such fears aside. Enjoy yourselves!"
61486,"That's just how it is with families. When we're chiefs, you'll see how it is. "
61488,I'll try and make this quick!
61491,"Turns out, we fatally underestimated the Thalmor. They smashed us with ease during the Great War."
61492,"No, I don't need to mark it. I remember it. "
61493,Did you mark it? 
61495,"I envy you, outlander. You can choose to leave if you wish."
61496,"Looking for a horse? I own these stables, but Skulvar can help you with a purchase."
61498,Sneak that ring back to Viola before we both get caught.
61501,"Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons..."
61502,"Assur says his pa says the College made lots of bad things happen, but the mages I've seen look nice."
61503,What in the bloody blazes?
61505,"As long as she continues to keep me at her side, she can count on my blade to protect her."
61506,"They are only a little late, Jarl. The trade routes are affected by the war, we should give them another day."
61513,Nice weapon you got there. Care to put it away?
61514,"You surrender Falkreath to us. Siddgeir steps down, and Dengeir of Stuhn resumes the Jarlship."
61515,"Get the money into the hands of one of these guards, and I'll tell you what you want to know."
61518,"That's it. Something's inside the house. Come on, we're getting to the bottom of this."
61519,Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation.
61522,It's just... aren't you worried about the Forsworn? Maybe it's not safe here.
61526,Yeah. That's what it's going to take.
61529,"By decree of the Jarl, the Alik'r are banned from Whiterun."
61532,The shrine of Namira is beyond that door. Get ready.
61533,I've enjoyed the boons that come with beastblood. Just like every member of the Circle.
61536,"Die, Grelod! Die!"
61537,I should never have come to Markarth.
61538,I don't think you're quite ready yet. 
61539,Bolar said you had been looking for a new wife?
61540,"Since Galka was taken from us. She's been... sad, I guess."
61546,"No, no. Mercer wants him alive, for now."
61547,"All right, then."
61548,"The Mages at the College keep to themselves for the most part, so we don't see much of them."
61549,"Die, vampire!"
61550,What's it say?
61551,The last time we'd discussed this issue was before this damnable war broke out. Things were different then.
61558,"Here is your reward for solving the murder, but I have another request."
61559,"Well now, that is something. Hand it over, please."
61560,"Patience, my son. The hunter days not welcome the blood of his prey, he waits for it."
61562,"Smart woman. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course."
61563,"By the Ashpit, we can't go on like this."
61568,I'm Bothela's assistant. She's the one you should talk to if you need an herb or a potion.
61577,What has he done now?
61578,"Unless you can find that crystal, there's no point in wasting more time with talk."
61581,"It is none of your concern, I assure you. Just... Forget that you ever saw me here."
61582,I demand that you leave at once and never speak of this again.
61583,They're not my aunts. They're your aunts. And they told me enough. 
61584,"Umm.... No, my Jarl. I'm afraid there isn't."
61586,Shhh!
61587,"Whiterun's walls are tall, but they are old and crumbling, like the Empire whose Legion lines them."
61588,I'm trying to pay attention.
61590,"After I've finished showing you the grounds, we can talk."
61591,Welcome to the College.
61594,"That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface."
61595,The say the College has been snooping around Saarthal. Mages in a burial crypt. No good can come of that...
61597,"Just leave Riften. Go far, far away and never return. This place is nothing but a rotten, stinking corpse that's sat in the sun far too long."
61598,Oh yes... you'll need one of my special brews...
61600,"You know, they say knowledge is its own reward."
61601,"Catchy, isn't it?"
61603,There's no glory in war. It's just something they tell soldiers so they'll risk their lives.
61604,"The Dark Elves and the Wood Elves have never been the best of friends. Be patient, they'll come around soon enough!"
61608,"Which calls to you, Dovahkiin? Fus, Feim, or Yol?"
61610,The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach.
61611,Igmund's father was killed by Forsworn. I won't rest until they've paid with their blood.
61613,I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of here.
61615,Now... now you'll let me go. Right?
61617,Hold there.
61618,I can't remember when I last slept...
61619,I look forward to it.
61621,I'm going to put my neck on the line. We need people like you in our outfit.
61623,"He killed Shagrol in combat, which none of us thought possible. But the winner is made Chief. That is how it is done."
61624,Begone. I have no wish to speak to anyone right now.
61626,Agh!
61632,"You're going to clear a path to the giant, so I can conserve my strength. I'll make sure you're paid for it."
61634,Feel free to make requests.
61635,"Sibbi's been spreading lies about me, you must hear me out."
61637,All these damn Stormcloaks. They're making me nervous. Never in a million years did I imagine they'd gain control of Solitude.
61638,We've got half of Skyrim back under our wing and the coin's startin' to flow.
61640,"See you, friend. And take it easy on the wine."
61642,"That said, some of the Legion's staunchest men have organized themselves, and are operating out of hidden military camps in the wilderness."
61646,...
61649,You're ready to get going?
61650,"First off, there's a couple of Imperials skulking about the hold. Need to cut their throats so they can't make their reports."
61652,"Sir, I'm going to need some better equipment if you want me plowing the frost."
61654,I've been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.
61655,You pathetic weakling!
61656,"But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said..."
61657,"First off, we hear a group of Imperial legionnaires are coming around to our way of thinking. With a little encouragement they'll join our side."
61661,"First of all, I'd like to drum up some more support from the local populace. I have someone in mind."
61662,"First of all, there's someone in particular I'd like to win over to our cause."
61663,"First, we're attacking the fort. I want that fort."
61664,What more do you need that Yatul and I cannot provide? 
61665,"The men who are looking for me, the Alik'r, they are assassins in the employ of the Aldmeri Dominion. They wish to exchange my blood for gold."
61667,"But... I'm sorry, you should go. The children aren't up for adoption, and it's cruel to get their hopes up. Besides, Grelod hates... visitors."
61668,"The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge."
61670,"This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you."
61671,"If there's a chance this will save me, then I'm taking it."
61672,Can't wait to get out of here.
61673,Wonderful. This will be a splendid addition to my private collection.
61674,"Where were you last night, Thonar? Busy with work or have you found some other woman who's willing to tolerate your lack of ambition?"
61675,"By all the gods, the groom has been killed. At his own wedding! I can only think of my own husband..."
61681,I suppose Kjeld asked for the usual discount?
61682,Then... it is true! She is back! Our Lady is back! She has chosen a Listener! She has chosen you! Ha ha ha! All hail the Listener!
61683,"Speak, worm!"
61692,Go away! Leave me alone!
61693,We're through! Keep at them!
61696,"I spend every day tending the fields, and what do my daughters do? Nothing! Complain and caterwaul! Sleep and eat! Useless!"
61697,"The dagger...? By Akatosh, they didn't even wrap it correctly?"
61701,Maybe you could be a taster or something.
61703,"Many fine things are here for you, friend."
61705,"He's the world's master of the nature of Elder Scrolls, but... well."
61706,Looking for my husband Nazeem? Check the Jarl's backside. That's usually where he stuffs himself these days.
61708,"Lot of people looking for him. Don't know his name, but he's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here."
61711,"I've tried to explain to Lurbuk that his ""singin'"" is gonna get his throat cut."
61713,But I can't leave here! I'm supposed to watch his house. What do I do?
61714,"Oh, come now. Don't go away mad."
61716,"Bolli's around somewhere, planning to feed the poor with his nonsense about Mara."
61719,"Am I! Free food and wine, and nobody trying to throw me in the dungeon. I wish they did weddings here every day."
61721,Are you listening?
61722,Because she was being stupid!
61724,It's yours now. I won't take it back. I won't.
61725,This is ridiculous.
61726,"No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up."
61734,Who could tell the difference?
61735,"Please, you have to believe me!"
61736,That last brigade of soldiers said there's a tall forest on the eastern edge of the White River.
61737,"Oh, like the sleepy rebel supporters in this town are going to tell anyone."
61738,I heard there was a Priest of Mara who was supposed to be looking into it. We'll see if anything comes of that.
61741,"I'll do my best, sir."
61742,"Is Vignar too old to be Jarl? It's a fair question. If he's grown infirm and is losing his wits, where does that leave the people of Whiterun?"
61743,"Oh, that's just adorable."
61744,If you could speak to him. Draw out the truth. I would be immensely grateful.
61745,Congratulations.
61750,Who did this to me?
61753,"For now, looking after Joric is my job."
61756,"The ""Eye of Magnus""?"
61758,"I keep telling you, without a warming enchantment, it will never grow past your ankles."
61760,"Now, I've been reading about the best ways to grow corn in permafrost..."
61764,Some nights I dream about the mists of Sovngarde.
61765,I can certainly share a bit of what I know.
61767,"The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!"
61769,This doesn't look good.
61771,"Here. Something I want you to have. Now, don't embarrass either of us by saying something sappy. Just... take it."
61772,"You have to understand, Gentle Repose is a fallow festering place I should have left a long time ago. This is one of the few ways I make any money."
61773,"Honest, I didn't take it!"
61774,"You dare summon me, Yamarz?"
61775,"She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just... just rest."
61776,A dragon? In Helgen? It can't be... although...
61777,You heard the summons. What else could it mean?
61782,"Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now."
61783,"Great, another ambitious visitor. You think you can just wander in here and join us?"
61787,"I always thought the new Harbinger would be taller, myself. "
61788,It shall be so.
61789,"Your deed was true, and so is my gratitude. Please take this in return for your efforts."
61790,"Ah, fresh blood. Hope you know how to handle yourself."
61791,I never thought they would actually let me join the Companions. But now it looks like they're letting anyone in these days.
61794,"I'm certain Maven wishes you to be in Whiterun, not wasting time here."
61796,Sure has been quiet around the shop lately.
61801,"Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close."
61803,"He's sending you after King Olaf's Verse then? That's good, we shouldn't leave it lying around now that I've figured out where it is."
61804,"Sure, whatever."
61807,You have a death wish or something?
61808,You look like you could use an ale.
61812,"Unless it's about the mill, I don't have time to talk. Too much to do."
61813,This has ruined my entire day.
61818,"You shouldn't be here, unless you've decided to bring Paarthurnax to justice."
61819,The Treasury House is really just for patrons of the Silver-Blood family. You don't belong here.
61821,Just here to work.
61822,"Once you've found out anything, come straight to me."
61823,Aaaaagh!
61824,Don't rush ahead. This is a trap if I ever saw one.
61825,"Your wedding will be held tomorrow, from dawn until dusk."
61826,Bah. He never had a connection with any of them beyond what his loins told him.
61828,What've you been staring at your feet this whole time? You see that big city up ahead of you? Markarth? 
61829,Hyunh!
61832,"Oh, pardon me. Were you saying something? I do apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and irrevocably..."
61833,"Assassins? No, nothing so crass."
61835,I serve the Dragonborn.
61836,I should be the one thanking you. You've solved more problems in the short time you've been here then anyone in my court has their entire careers.
61837,"All-righty. Good luck out there, boss."
61840,Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do.
61841,Don't know what that man expects. House is empty.
61842,I should remind Kleppr to clean this place up.
61844,"Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement."
61851,What in Oblivion is that?
61852,"I don't know where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon."
61854,"Well, then this should be no problem at all for you."
61855,"When you get to be my age, you'll come to miss the smell of blood. Strange, I know."
61857,Oh dear. Darkwater Crossing needs medicines for its miners?
61858,You are an inspiration. Do you know that?
61859,"Oh Jon, stop dallying. You know you have to go. It's why Mara put you on this earth."
61860,"Teeba-Ei is cold, but Teeba-Ei works hard as always."
61861,"Please help me, I'm going to lose my job at the Riften Fishery."
61862,You did it! All three targets in eight seconds. Nice job.
61863,So be it.
61865,We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few minutes.
61868,"Oh, no skeevers out here, sir. They can't stand the cold."
61869,"And what about you, Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?"
61870,Any luck on your end?
61871,"If you think you'll make your fortune kickin' around the Flagon all day, that's where your wrong."
61883,"Allow me to gather the materials I need for my ritual, and then I will meet you outside the ruins."
61884,"Unless you're here to solve this nightmare problem, I don't need you."
61885,"I'll be the judge of that. Besides, by all reports the Stormcloaks are suffering just as much as we are from these dragon attacks."
61886,There are no heroes in this war. No winners to be had and no real conclusion.
61887,"I've read the entrails many times, but can't fathom why Mauhulakh's wives keep finding tragedy."
61892,"Seems like no one is getting a decent night's rest in Dawnstar, stranger. Best buy your steel and move on."
61895,"Perhaps not. But this Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again."
61896,"Been talk of a little boy in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Get this - he's been trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Foolish lad..."
61905,"Balgruuf, my Jarl. A word, if I may."
61906,Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for the memories of others.
61908,"My daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army.  I was hoping you might have met her."
61909,Do not ask me to take treasures from this place. I will not risk the anger of the dead.
61915,"Well, it shows. Your skill rivals some of the greatest miners I've known."
61917,The Winking Skeever's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.
61918,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
61919,"Can't just throw the big logs on the fire. Got to have the little bits, too."
61920,"Well now, you are a strange one. You remind me a bit of myself, when I'm stalking a deer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that..."
61922,I'm through with you. Get out of my way.
61923,We'll see about that.
61924,"What? Oh! How could I have possibly forgotten. Your reward, of course... of course."
61927,"Can't stop to chat, citizen."
61930,Make them all pay for what they've done to me...
61931,Look more closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's grievances. 
61933,I'm one of the few native sons of the Reach that owns land. It doesn't make me very popular.
61935,An astute observation.
61936,We're in control of this mine. No sudden moves.
61938,"No, though you may be the last. The one who calls himself Ancano has sought my knowledge as well, through very different questions."
61940,"It is a good path, one untraveled by many. It is a path that can save your College. I will tell you what you need to know to follow it further."
61941,The one who calls himself Ancano.
61942,"You going to try and sell me something? Well, I ain't interested."
61948,"I know what path you set him on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most."
61949,Haven't you seen how my aunts act with my father? It's beyond strange. 
61952,Who are you? Why are you here? Leave this place. I have much work to conduct....
61953,You don't worry about two Orc men coming into your stronghold? That they might challenge you?
61954,There are so few pleasures in life as fine as your company.
61957,Why don't you take it? We can always make another for the day when this war ends and Thorald can come home.
61962,"I'm sorry -- she was very dear to me, and it's rather painful to think about. "
61963,That's what an old man gets for thinking the younger generation might be interested in learning some honor.
61968,I understand.
61969,Leave here. Leave here and never return.
61970,"Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us meet as equals."
61973,Move along.
61975,"Please, oh please, I don't want to die..."
61978,I'm afraid it's not that simple.
61981,"The... the books? Oh, I see. I thought perhaps... Well, I thought you'd come for me."
61982,"You were born into the pack, brother."
61983,We have to go through town and across the bridge to get to Bleak Falls Barrow.
61984,"It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh?"
61986,"Maybe when this is all over, you could sign one of your cookbooks for me?"
61988,"Farewell, then. If you need my services again, just come and look for me in the usual place."
61989,"Oh, I always knew my Thorald was alive. Ain't a man in Skyrim who can keep a Gray-Mane down."
61990,"Ranmir has no problem drinking himself under the table, so I have to be the one to make ends meet."
61991,"We did this in the name of Mephala, whom I used to quite fervently worship."
61992,There you are. 
61993,I'm Igmund's uncle as well as his steward. 
61998,"Ri'saad was able to look past that, and it was he who helped to set me up with a trade caravan. Now I work for him."
62000,"I don't know, my darling wife. I assume you're going to tell me?"
62001,"Go down already, you bastard!"
62002,Maybe we'll meet in the field. Just pray we're on the same side.
62003,Assur had to move away because of the Empire. But we get to stay.
62005,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
62007,Did you see my husband already? I'm sorry... he can come off a bit rough at times.
62008,I have plenty of room in my bed.
62010,I've always felt a great deal of guilt running from Nightcaller Temple and leaving my friends to die. I'll never forgive myself for that.
62011,"I'm very busy, you know. I'm the only one Kraldar can rely on to assist him."
62014,"It turns out that if people think you're some sort of secret wizard, they'll let you get away with a lot."
62015,"Winterhold may not look impressive, but it has a very rich history."
62016,"Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind."
62017,"When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill."
62020,"Come, child, I will tell you how to track a snow cat."
62022,"Jarl Black-Briar put your government together. Do it now, or there will be rioting in the streets."
62024,Most of our business comes from folks traveling to and from the College.
62028,Ah!
62029,"If he does, he isn't telling me a thing. I've asked, but all I get from him are more questions."
62031,"The choice is yours, friend. We're all counting on you to make the right decision. Put him out of our misery!"
62032,Vilkas will see if you're worth our trouble.
62033,You're telling me.
62034,"Oh, yes? I wonder what that old busybody wants now."
62036,Aren't the Greybeards expecting some supplies?
62037,"There was a bit of talk about some staff you had in safe keeping. Never said where, but you sure didn't have it with you!"
62039,Who does that? Who just leaves their garbage lying about?
62041,Thanks for bringing the claw back.
62042,A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...
62044,"If you're here for sight-seeing, well then you've seen the sights. Might as well head somewhere warmer."
62045,Don't worry about those Stormcloaks. You're safe from them here. As if they'd want the place anyway.
62050,"You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired."
62051,I'm... I'm sorry you had to see that.
62054,"Don't worry, my love. Just show the bugs your adoring face, and they'll scurry away in complete fear in no time."
62056,"This time let's try ""The Age of Oppression"". I will demonstrate for the class."
62057,Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.
62059,Azura's Star. A Daedric artifact that allows any number of souls to pass through it.
62060,I haven't seen you hunting in a while.
62061,Please move quickly. Eldergleam awaits us.
62063,A few coins for my soul? If only you understood the irony.
62064,"Well, I've certainly heard worse things."
62067,"Thank you, hero. Now I may finally rest. Take Hevnoraak's iron mask. It may be of use to you, and serve as some reward for your feat here."
62069,(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
62071,If we could get into the Thalmor Embassy... it's the center of their operations in Skyrim...
62072,Robbery is what it is. The Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land.
62074,Talos preserve you.
62075,"Well, this is a nice mess you've gotten me into."
62079,"The great stronghold of Narzulbur welcomes you, outsider. "
62081,"I sell cures for all ills, and I'll be happy to serve you."
62084,"I'm in no mood for conversation. Now go, and leave me be."
62086,"Mama doesn't like me jumping up and down in the house, but I can't help it. I swear."
62087,I trust everything went well?
62088,No you aren't.
62089,"Our son joining the Stormcloaks. If this war had never happened, Cade would have joined the Imperial Legion, like grandfather."
62091,Gods damn those Forsworn. So many dead...
62092,Aye.
62094,You come to Dawnstar at a bad time. Tempers are... fiery.
62095,"Trust me, there's no place better to forge relationships with the movers and shakers of Skyrim."
62096,Mmmhmm.
62097,The Jarls never want to pay to keep the forts. They just keep slipping further into ruin.
62102,Like you won't do different?
62104,"A true Nord would settle it himself, but at least this way Iddra gets her coin. Thank you. Tell her I'll be fine."
62105,I've got some wonderful jewelry.
62106,"Men ran and they cowered, and they fought and they died. They burned and they bled as they issued their cries."
62107,Fell off the top of the cliff after a drunken party with the priestesses of Dibella.
62109,"What is it, Khajiit?"
62111,"You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them in this, but it seems we have no choice."
62112,Why do you delay? Are you Dovahkiin or not?
62113,He has some simple-minded courier delivering it?
62114,Thanks a lot!
62115,"Oh, interesting. I'll read it this evening."
62117,I hope monsters come and eat you.
62118,"I'm just protecting Bryling's investment. She's the owner, even though we're the ones here doing all the work."
62119,You're also free to die for it.
62121,"Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But with Hjorunn gone..."
62122,Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
62123,It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine.
62125,"I see. Well, let's continue this discussion later then."
62127,"I met her when I wandered into Riften a few years ago. Been smitten with her ever since. In fact, I'm thinking of asking her to marry me."
62128,When will I learn how to forge weapons and armor? Isn't that my job?
62131,"Um, no. Nothing. Nothing at all."
62134,"Nonsense, you're a vital part of my research team. You'll be there, have no fear! Now, I don't want to hear another word of protest."
62135,Filthy natives. Get to work. We have meals to prepare and no time to prepare them!
62137,My niece Svana helps me with the chores. She'd be more help if she kept her head out of the clouds.
62138,What is the meaning of this?
62139,A battle-mage of fearsome cunning.
62140,Whatever. Just get back to work. Now.
62143,I have overcome my nature only through meditation and long study of the Way of the Voice.
62145,"Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter."
62149,"You know, I think you're right."
62151,"Ah, that. Yes, the group prior to yours has disappeared entirely."
62152,"No, I'm sorry. I'll just... I'll know it if I find it. Does that make sense?"
62153,"Lady Ateia, it is the official position of the college to remain neutral in all political affairs. We cannot risk our history by choosing sides."
62154,I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon full of gold isn't good enough for you?
62160,I promise I'll help you get out of here.
62161,What if I told you about a large shipment of gold and weapons?
62165,We have to move. We'll talk more once we see the sky.
62167,It's still here! Get it out!
62170,Thank the Divines! Let's move!
62174,I can't believe that worked.
62175,"Wish to converse with the crazy old elf, eh? Very well. Go on."
62176,We'd best be careful in here.
62177,Hofgrir is a great teacher. I've learned so much about horses from him.
62178,See if they have any cheese. I'm getting a bit... peckish.
62180,"I know, but..."
62182,Well aren't you a pretty thing? Should my new bride by worried? He he he he.
62183,A citizen of the Rift has asked for our help.
62184,I believe Brynjolf wishes to speak with you. We're done here.
62189,Nyyarrggh!
62192,"Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften we mean business better than a huge column of smoke."
62195,"So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it."
62198,"Please help me, I'm starving."
62200,"With pleasure. Nature has a way of finding vengeance, though. You walk a bleak path, friend. One that will lead to suffering. "
62202,Delphine! I... it's good to see you. It's been... a long time.
62205,Let's see. From a Loredas of Last Seed until a Middas of Heartfire... it will happen soon. Very soon.
62206,Eehh.. Calixto and his books are often confused about such matters. It happens to the best of us. 
62207,"Hello, my friend. Come to visit the forge?"
62209,"I know it well. Or at least, I've heard of it. I would wager that carving once depicted a skull."
62211,Are you prepared to receive my golden words?
62220,We're keeping the mine closed until that crypt is clear.
62221,What? There's a whole shift down there!
62223,"We must leave. Your father will never approve of us, and I grow weary of this place."
62225,"I wonder why they only stole Lucan's golden claw. I mean, we have plenty of things in the shop that are worth just as much coin."
62227,"The latest recruit! Right? Wait, is that right? "
62232,"Is everything well, Nelacar?"
62234,It's abandoned and it's always been abandoned.
62235,"Right, then."
62236,Alduin mahlaan
62240,"But there's no shame in it. One of them dragons comes callin' in Whiterun, the place'll go up like tinder."
62243,I know they are. I've visited their ancient burial mounds and found them empty.
62246,Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?
62247,"You may be Listener, and head of the Sanctuary, but your recent behavior sets a bad example. I must insist you pay a fine of 300 gold."
62254,"I've been a fool, wasting my time sitting here helpless when I could have sent help sooner. Perhaps this is all my doing..."
62256,I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Hrongar of Whiterun.
62257,That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.
62258,"I'll pay you to figure it, whether or not he's guilty."
62259,"If you're looking for supplies, I'd advise heading to Riften."
62262,"""Disappointed"" is not the word I would choose, Colette. Excuse me."
62263,"Yeah, we'll get the valuables out of there, no problem!"
62265,"You don't think there's any hope, do you? I don't. He's right."
62266,"Did he, now? That doesn't sound like my nephew at all. I doubt he'd be mixed up with the likes of you."
62268,We remember what most don't - that the Dragonborn is the ultimate dragonslayer.
62269,"The village of Ivarstead. The woman, Fastred. "
62270,Come and browse my fine selection! Everything's fresh and delicious!
62271,"Fine, it's your neck."
62273,"Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle."
62274,"A tragic, and very, very profitable event."
62275,"I'll be out in the market all day, from eight in the morning until eight in the evening."
62278,My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. We like to collect things.
62279,I... I swear I felt something rather strange just then.
62281,"Well, I know she thinks the world of you. "
62285,The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd.
62288,Daughter. Who is this you have brought me?
62290,"By the gods, he's just a retired ship's captain."
62292,"If that's not enough, I suppose... I have this amulet you could take. "
62294,I've figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.
62297,You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed a bit upset at how I've been entertaining their comrades.
62298,"She ran away when the war started. Her husband, Thonnir, was devastated. No note or nothin'."
62299,An old storeroom. See if you can find some potions. Might come in handy.
62300,Hyargh!
62301,"Master, I..."
62303,Meet the soldiers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.
62305,"Sorry. I thought I saw a fellow running away, but didn't get a good look at him."
62310,I'm taking it anyway.
62312,"No. I don't have anything for bad dreams, so don't ask."
62313,"If you're not sure maybe you don't belong here. I'll ask again, are we clear on all of this?"
62314,"I see. The dragon will lead you to Alduin, but without the Jarl's help..."
62315,"I tried to get Ulfric to even come down here to see the squalor, but the High Lord of His Mightiness couldn't find the time."
62325,"Yes, sir."
62327,"How's it going, Unblooded? You find anything yet?"
62328,"That's all! I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?"
62330,"Lots of lawless folk around here. Foreigners, mostly. No offense."
62332,Time to cleanse the Empire of its filth.
62334,"I was assigned to Ulfric's guard. We were on our way to Darkwater Crossing, in the south of Eastmarch."
62335,Soft sheets and hard liquor. What's not to like?
62336,"Ah well. At least I have all the comforts of home during my stay. Well, except the touch of a woman of course."
62337,But this is only a small part of their power. Zofaas suleyk.
62338,"It's in the most immediate danger, if that dragon is lurking in the mountains..."
62339,"My father was a Priest of Arkay. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers."
62340,"You'll shut your mouth and get back to work, or you won't be a miner or a soldier by the day's end. Hear me?"
62341,Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy something for this headache.
62344,I'm worried about my son. I'm keeping an eye on him for a little while before I pass on.
62346,I know my father would be worried about me. I'm here to let him know everything's all right.
62348,"I worry about my sister. This way I can keep an eye on her, make sure she's not getting into trouble."
62349,"I worry about my brother. This way I can keep an eye on him, make sure he's not getting into trouble."
62350,I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
62354,"I can pat you on the back all day, but coin's coin, right?"
62356,"My mother's been haunting me ever since she died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad she's here."
62357,"Oh, I don't think you're old enough for that yet. You can help me salt the cheese curd."
62358,"Worse still, to pay for the privilege to keep his throne, the Emperor sells Skyrim and our very gods - Talos, no less! - to the damn elves."
62359,"Oh you poor thing, you must be starving. Come to the temple later and let us feed you."
62360,I think you better listen to Mercer and Brynjolf first. We can talk later.
62361,"I was a little scared at first, but I like having my brother around. It's comforting."
62362,Constance Michel says we have to be careful of people we don't know.
62363,"So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines."
62364,"I'm not asking, but if you happen to be the type, I hear that Kilkreath Ruin is a shrine to Merdia. You know. Daedra worship."
62365,What? Why would the stranger attack innocent Cicero?
62367,"Typically we avoid bestowing it upon men, but for the Sybil's escort, we could make an exception."
62368,Redbelly is supposed to be nothing but an iron mine. Been working it for years.
62369,Don't know why you're asking me. But I'm glad that damn Imperial is gone. Something wrong about him.
62370,Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
62374,You're wearing Mara's amulet? You? I'd marry you. I'd marry you twice.
62375,And the excavations into Nchuand-Zel are dangerous. Dwemer machines and traps still function even after thousands of years.
62376,You should speak to the priest in the Temple of Mara to arrange the ceremony. No sense waiting.
62379,"I might be old, but I haven't forgotten that a Jarl's first duty is to look after his people."
62382,I'll see you at our wedding!
62383,"As short as life can be in this land, we will have each other."
62385,I'm looking forward to our wedding. You and me....
62391,"All set, let's go."
62392,"You assassins and your riddles. It really does get very annoying, you know. Now if you'll excuse me..."
62395,We must hurry if we're going to defeat Ancano.
62399,As you wish.
62403,"Silus keeps filling his house with those Mythic Dawn things. Creepy, I tell you."
62404,"No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done."
62406,I keep gazing into the pommel gem. Not a single flaw.
62409,I miss Reyda. She was so nice to Narfi. Narfi's sad he can't be with Reyda.
62410,"My word, look at those ruins. Remarkable."
62412,Honestly. Have you any idea?
62413,We could fix you right up.
62416,Please exercise caution. This is not a procedure without possible... consequences.
62417,"As you may be aware, the College has gone to great lengths to purify and enhance the natural energies of the world."
62418,How goes the trade in and out of the city? 
62420,I believe it should indicate how to enter the blocked off sections of the stronghold.
62421,"What can an old skald do for you, huh?"
62422,"There have been reports of weird happenings near Wolfskull Cave. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps bandits."
62427,"He's an Argonian layabout, likes to scavenge shipwrecks. My guess is he'll run if threatened. Or swim, if given the chance."
62429,"All this knowledge might have been lost, were it not for you."
62430,Check with Urag gro-Shub in the Arcanaeum. See if he's aware of any references to this... thing that you and Tolfdir found.
62432,"Ha! I knew it! Had your name written all over it, that one did!"
62433,You were right about this place. And about Mauhulakh.
62435,"Walk always in shadows, so that you will see your foes before they see you."
62437,The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent.
62439,Keeping this place secure is as simple as breaking a few spines.
62441,"Oooh. Ahhh... Well... See, the thing is..."
62443,I'll see you.
62444,Mara have mercy that gave me a fright.
62445,Didn't you just see that woman getting attacked in front of us? We're closed.
62446,"Okay, okay. Just trying make this place a little less... boring."
62448,Do you take me for a fool? Get this drivel away from me!
62449,Indeed.
62450,The guards don't even dare go up there unless they've no choice.
62452,"No, I've been busy trying to keep the whole mine from collapsing, if that's all right with you."
62456,Here we go...
62457,"Sven, we need to talk..."
62461,Will you take it to Captain Aldis?
62464,Yes of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision.
62466,He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice.
62469,I'm going to crush you like a bug!
62470,"And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself."
62473,Ugh... damn thing.
62476,"Let us see it, then."
62477,(panting)
62479,"I work the forge, with my mother Gharol. We mine our own ore and shape our own metal."
62480,"I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of... nowhere."
62482,"Normally I'd agree, but we've already lost so many contacts across Skyrim. If we lose the ones in Riften, we may as well close up shop."
62484,"I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity."
62485,"It doesn't matter. Look, it's refilling with your tonic as we speak."
62486,I'll contact my man tonight and let you know what he says.
62490,"But it's one thing to take pride in your lineage, and another to cling blindly to the past. What they call honor and tradition, I call ignorance."
62491,"Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this."
62492,He's gone in to defile our family tomb by using our ancestors for his filthy dark elf necromancy.
62493,"Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?"
62494,Let me guess - you need a drink. It's the Silver-Blood Inn you're looking for.
62495,Looks like we're in for quite a harvest. We've had better luck with our planting than any village in the hold.
62497,Please come back if you're ever in need of fletching supplies.
62498,"I'm sorry, I should really go now."
62499,I could never hope to approach her.
62500,Jofthor... what about him? He'll come after us and... it will be unpleasant.
62502,Good. Don't die out there.
62503,Where will we go? 
62504,"They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground."
62506,"Bassianus, sweetie, what is it?"
62507,"With you as my muse, how could I not?"
62508,"Kolskeggr Mine is lost, friend. Forsworn killed everyone."
62510,Why not?
62512,Can you imagine the kind of power behind this?
62514,"Have you met my father? He's the steward, up at Dragonsreach."
62517,"I'm assuming you're here for more than a social call. Down to business, eh?"
62518,Weergh!
62521,"Don't forget. You find Queen Freydis's Sword, I'll reward you."
62522,You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Approach.
62524,"Of course, sent by... what is it that she's calling herself these days? Shazra? Saadia? One of those, correct?"
62525,"Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put whatever you have over there, then get out!"
62526,New to Markarth?
62530,"Raerek is far too cautious, but I'll agree with him on any measure that keeps this city safe."
62532,...to you?
62535,"Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting."
62536,"Of course, they'd probably already be dead..."
62537,"And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire."
62539,"Now if I thought she was really in love with Bassianus, that would be one thing. But she's a child."
62540,You know very well what I'm talking about. You're saying that I only married Bolli for his gold and that I don't really love him.
62545,"These are the most dangerous, but the most profitable types of ruins. The dwarves must have been a prosperous race."
62547,"You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there..."
62550,"It's not so simple as just killing them, though."
62551,"Lady Maven, how may I help you?"
62552,Exploiting? What's that supposed to mean? Erik works the farm because he's a good lad!
62553,"Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting."
62554,If you really think you can manage...
62555,Karliah? Then she's finally found it.
62556,What do you need?
62557,What do you want?
62559,Ha! Tough talk for someone who's about to have their guts spilled.
62560,"Dengeir deserves more respect than his nephew, Jarl Siddgeir, affords him."
62562,Ah. I sometimes forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as we are. This is a rough translation:
62564,"My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl."
62565,Don't come back until you have the ring.
62566,I have no business with you.
62567,"We do the best we can, even though we have next to nothing. But we Nords don't give up, not ever."
62570,I served in the Great War as a Legion battlemage. I've no desire to go back.
62571,Beyond that I seek only to be left alone to pursue my research.
62572,I'll need to prepare them for mounting again.
62574,Hurry! Get me out of here!
62575,I am Burguk's favored wife. He knows my beauty should be praised.
62576,You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.
62579,"I heard about what you did at the Guild all the way out here. Sorry, can't buy or sell anything from you."
62582,"Grelka, how fast can you get your hands on some longbows?"
62584,That the best you can do?
62585,"Did you need something, Colette?"
62586,Thanks Nana. I feel better now.
62589,"Fight well, and I'll make sure your corpse is not dishonored."
62591,"The only thing better than a powerful mage fighting at your side is... well, nothing, really."
62592,I take my duties as Housecarl very seriously. I won't hesitate to shed blood if my uncle Vignar is threatened.
62593,"Drifa? I was looking through our books and there's an entry for ""spices."" Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?"
62594,Surely you have something better to do...
62595,Why settle for just stabbing your foes when you can roast them alive in a gout of arcane fire?
62596,"Hey, I'm not done talking to you yet. Come back here!"
62598,"Well! Finders, keepers as they say."
62599,"Mind your manners and pay your bills, and you'll always be welcome."
62600,"If it's a lady you're looking for, you'd best look elsewhere. Once Mikael gets them, they're got."
62603,...need me some skooma... the imported stuff... just one last time...
62606,Thanks. I'll be waiting for it.
62607,Whiterun once again belongs to its rightful heirs. It's a glorious day for Skyrim.
62608,This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.
62609,I'm sorry to say your payment for the job will have to go to elsewhere since you feel like taking things in your own direction.
62610,"For thirty years, I served the Legion as a commander. Fought in the Great War."
62612,Can't wait to see the look on their faces when they find us here waiting to spill their blood.
62614,"The flame of my master burns low. Without him, we are all lost and forever gray... Please, help us!"
62615,"Evgir Unslaad has come at last. The ""Season Unending."" War... without end."
62618,You should leave. Skald gets upset around Imperials.
62619,Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.
62620,"So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a joor... mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood."
62621,"What? Well, we'll see about that now, won't we?"
62622,"The way I see it, Ulfric's fighting a holy war."
62623,The Thu'um! She summons the Thu'um!
62625,May the gods speed your journeys... and steady your sword arm.
62626,"While you're on my boat, you follow my rules. First rule is, don't touch anything that doesn't belong to you."
62627,"It's my desire to enter the Bards College. My parents are hesitant, but I pray they let me attend."
62628,Watch your feet. We just cleaned there!
62629,He's taking the Empire to task and making them answer for their crimes.
62632,"He has returned... Oh, how Talos has returned. Helgen has been purged in his light. Will Whiterun be next?"
62633,Skuldafn fen kos dinok.
62635,There's some company I certainly prefer over others. Have you met Mikael? The most amazing bard I've ever heard.
62636,"You don't need my fruit, I've heard when you sing people throw tomatoes at you anyway."
62637,"Wait. You're that new bard, the one who saved the Festival. Aren't you?"
62639,Ahh... yeah.
62642,I can only imagine the headaches this is going to cause...
62643,Who's asking?
62645,What? Why you lookin' at me?
62647,"Fine, you win. Take the horse and leave."
62648,"Come to chat with an old woman, hmm? Do your good deed for the day?"
62650,"If you ever settle down to have children, think twice before you do it."
62652,Don't leave me here!
62653,Suit yourself. I'm always here.
62654,That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated.
62655,"It seems this damnable conflict has claimed everyone's passions of late. Me, I prefer my books, and my spells."
62659,"Look, did you want the information or not?"
62660,"Soon, my dearest. Soon."
62663,Huh?
62664,"It's probably meaningless to you, but according to family legend it links our bloodline back to Ysgramor himself."
62665,"I love weddings, don't you?"
62668,What is it that you need?
62669,Speak your mind.
62670,"According to my grandfather at least. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into."
62671,"Let's find that Totem, Shield-Brother."
62674,"The security in Whiterun is terrible. Shameful, is what it is."
62675,"There you go, son. Be your own man!"
62676,"What's the matter with you? We said keep it clean! Well, you can just forget about your payment."
62677,Think very carefully about your next move...
62678,Got the fleetest steeds in all o' Skyrim.
62682,Is that Lady Mara's amulet? I'm shocked a fine person like you isn't married already.
62683,"Forgive me milord, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed."
62684,Last time you said he was fighting for the Empire.
62685,"Sorry, I don't know anything about those kinds of things."
62686,Sorry... I usually have a nose for this kind of thing.
62692,Just a few more hours and I can crawl under some furs...
62693,"Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were close."
62695,They say this marriage is the first step towards peace. Who in Shor's name wants peace? Pfft.
62696,"Yes, err, apologies for the intrusion. I was wondering, err, if you could possibly, ah, procure a few select items for me."
62701,I'll get back to the Bannered Mare soon enough. Just need to stretch my legs a bit...
62702,Who enters? Will nobody save poor Melka?
62704,You better get proof of your accusations against Alva.
62705,I hear the steward asked you to look into the fire.
62707,Nice job hitting those targets.
62709,We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own. With our blood and our steel we'll take back our home.
62710,"My friend, you may not realize it, but you have served the Empire, indeed all of Tamriel, in ways you cannot possibly imagine."
62712,The Augur?
62713,Keep away from that bow. It's mine.
62714,We've made a mistake. Now move along before that mouth of yours gets you into trouble.
62717,We need to find the burial mound. Let's ask in the inn.
62719,I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in her stories.
62720,"Faralda's working on something, and I want to know what it is."
62722,"Ahlam, let's be honest. Your husband is an arrogant, domineering buffoon. These are the words you used to describe him to me... remember?"
62724,"You and I, we're the only people in Skyrim worth loving. That's what I think."
62726,I'm just worried about what he's teaching her.
62727,"Well, I don't think you should stay things like that about the Ambassador!"
62728,"I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it."
62731,You're not from around here. That makes two of us.
62734,Mey!
62735,"Oh, yes sir. I feel many of Solitude's families are having trouble getting by, and the wealthy do nothing to help them!"
62736,"With Leifnarr gone, it's really put me in a terrible bind. I'm having trouble making ends meet."
62737,Because it's boring. The fields are going to do fine... you don't have to dote over them so much.
62739,The toes are my favorite part. I hope I get to take a few home with me.
62740,"If you're looking for a bed, this is the wrong place."
62741,"Just a man's life work, is all. I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but this doting busybody won't let me get it."
62742,"Nearly thirty years, now."
62746,"We can't afford to give Paarthurnax the opportunity to betray us in turn, and return to his old master."
62749,Now tell me where my brother is!
62750,"I only take real coin here, no handouts and no bartering."
62751,I'm not taking any visitors.
62753,"We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people should know that."
62754,I doubt any of us are coming back from this mission.
62755,It takes a brave soul to wander onto my deck. It'll take more than that to leave in one piece.
62756,Thanks! Here - this is for you.
62757,Khajiit is ready for any troublemakers.
62758,"Then you're either a Stormcloak sympathizer or a fool. Either way, you're no friend of mine."
62760,Wake me up when you're ready to fight me for real.
62761,We are ready to mount our final attack.
62765,"I, Lurbuk the Great, will win the hearts of the people of Morthal one day, mark my words!"
62766,"Oh right, the rum. Thank you. I developed a taste for it after a fair weather trip to Hammerfell."
62768,We going?
62770,"Oh, this is going to be great!"
62771,I was apprenticed to Balimund before he died. He taught me everything I know about forging armor and weapons.
62773,You want something or not?
62774,"Look, I've moved all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk and I'm barely scraping by."
62776,Let's not waste too much time talking when there is glory to be had.
62777,"Who are the Stormcloaks, and why would mama want to spend time with them instead of me?"
62779,Hmph. Hadn't expected you had it in you. Here. Take this for a job well done.
62780,Your not winnin' points with me with that attitude.
62782,"You do have a plan for luring a dragon here, yeah?"
62783,"Yes, yes, what is it now?"
62784,"Secondly, some rebel scouts that have seen too much are moving through the hold. Need to take them out before they report back to their leaders."
62786,"""Uncommon Taste."" It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight."
62787,"As far as the Guild's concerned this is between Sibbi and Maven, so we're going to officially stay out of it."
62788,I don't know exactly. We need to find the ancient burial mound. Let's ask around town.
62789,"I understand, Listener. And I hope you understand that until the fine is paid, I must insist you refrain from all Dark Brotherhood business."
62791,Good... here's your assignment.
62794,And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd like to offer you a home in Windhelm. Speak with my steward who'll make the arrangements.
62795,"I bet she'll talk to you, too."
62796,Skaggi tells me that you were bothering him today. Can't you and Torom just play by yourselves?
62797,"Thank you for your help with Vals. Please, take this and leave me to see to Aunt Agna and my other family members."
62798,"Oh, you've seen your father just trying to chase a skeever from his house. He's a bit soft."
62803,I suggest you talk to Karliah first. She has some news that'll turn your stomach.
62804,Feel like doing a bit of shopping... the Guild way?
62805,"You'd better get to Riften. Ask around the Ragged Flagon, in the Ratway. It's at least a good starting point."
62809,"Working at the Riften Fishery is tough, but it puts some coin in my pocket."
62810,Here. Just don't make me look like an ass in front of the Guild and mess it up.
62812,"Amazing what people leave laying around for us to take, isn't it?"
62814,Die dog!
62816,"If by ""work"" you mean ""testing your steel in bloody battle."""
62817,"You drew blood, so you aren't getting paid. That's the rules. You don't like it, take it up with Brynjolf."
62818,"That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying."
62819,All right! I knew you'd do it. This is going to be so fun. You can't even imagine!
62821,"Come by Belethor's shop, at the market. I'm sure we've got something you need."
62822,"Truly, one of our great fires has gone out. "
62823,Good.
62824,"Ah, yes. Thank you. I'll get to work on this right away."
62825,I'll add it to the list of things I need to take care of. Thank you.
62826,"There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered."
62827,The boss went down there? Today?
62831,"Still here? What's the matter, can't handle what I'm throwing your way?"
62832,"I speak, and others hear. It is my hope that instead they listen."
62835,Do they know where he is?
62836,"Alvor and I, we got a daughter. Little Dorthe. "
62838,Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death.
62840,"It's about time someone arrived. Here, make sure this is handled properly."
62843,What in the nine holds is that?
62846,I won't be able to relax until I'm sure Potema is dealt with.
62847,"I, uh, I can't tell Thongvor. It's anyone's guess."
62850,"Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down."
62853,That letter ought to convince Camilla to never speak to Faendal ever again.
62854,"For centuries, we have benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with the south."
62857,"Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your dragon project."
62858,"But he's a dangerous man. It's why they call him ""the Unliving."" I wouldn't approach him directly."
62862,What do you think? I can't let Ulfric dictate terms to me before the negotiations even start.
62869,Then your poverty is my reward. Kill or be killed!
62870,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
62871,"Werewolves, wizards, eternal ten year-old vampires... what does it matter? In truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked."
62873,Not interested? Fine. Then let me offer it to someone with a little more backbone.
62874,Murder. Banditry. Assault. Theft. And lollygagging.
62875,We're taking Winterhold. Get over there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
62876,Been too long since I've embraced my rage...
62878,I wonder if I could put the dogs to work somehow. But I don't really have the heart to force them.
62879,"It's considered a great honor for the family. Their daughter will never know hardship, and the goddess blesses them with great bounty."
62881,I wouldn't stay here long if I were you.
62882,"She began to spend a lot of time with Alva. Yet just a week before, she despised her."
62883,"Papa, the next time you go away, I want to come with you."
62884,"Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition."
62885,"I...I miss our son terribly, especially since Eorlund died. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials."
62887,"In your dreams! If I win, the next round's on you!"
62892,We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.
62893,"Mara's mercy, then he's safe! Come on, we have a lot to discuss."
62898,My kinsman died. Things won't be the same without him.
62899,"It is done. Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, and the Dark Brotherhood yet lives."
62904,"Who was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun!"
62905,By the gods... what was that?
62908,"Here, take your gold and leave me in peace."
62911,"We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though."
62914,"Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too - the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days."
62915,I must have spent every last coin I've made with the Guild trying to find out what it means.
62918,"It means you can kill dragons and steal their power - even speak with a dragon's voice, they say."
62919,"There are stories about you, and dark tidings in Dawnstar..."
62920,The mages don't let us go in the College. They said it's not safe in there.
62922,I wish you the best of luck.
62923,"First, we have information regarding the movements of a rebel courier. We need to intercept him and confiscate his package."
62924,"The meals I serve ain't what I'd call a Jarl's feast, but they'll fill your belly."
62926,Fine. Whatever you want. Can't you just kill me and get it over with?
62928,Vun...
62929,"Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow."
62930,What're you looking at?
62934,"It's difficult to appreciate her gifts in these dark times, but you should consider her light a beacon in the storm."
62936,"Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we?"
62938,"Kleppr, you idiot! Can't you do anything right?"
62939,"Someone lied. Someone told the guard poor Cicero did something he did not. We were detained, delayed! The Night Mother kept from her new home!"
62941,"Look around, see if you see anything unusual. Any signs of the mound being disturbed. Anything."
62942,"Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here."
62945,Go away.
62947,The farmer is at his farm! Where else would he be? Loreius is his name. Talk to him. Convince him to help poor Cicero.
62948,"Yes, from what I've heard I expect Tolfdir will be occupied for some time. Hmm, that is a problem, isn't it?"
62950,"Yes, that will be fine. Thank you."
62952,Go with the Nine.
62957,Fus!
62958,Until next time.
62961,May the gods keep you.
62962,Stay sharp out there.
62964,Great! Thanks! Bastard stole from me. I'll catch him though!
62965,"Ever get the impression Rikke's not always sure what side she's on? I'm not doubting her loyalty. Just, she seems rather sympathetic to the rebels."
62966,Show the rebels the futility of their cause.
62969,Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.
62973,"You gave those mongrels a real whipping, eh? Good work. We'll be sure to send a garrison to reinforce the area and keep the peace."
62974,"We hit 'em where it hurts. As soon as we can, we'll take over - make the needed repairs. In the meantime, the people no longer slave for the Empire."
62976,"It's a great honor for them to summon you. They speak to very few - in fact, they hardly speak at all."
62977,Tacitus? What is this?
62979,Yay!
62981,Might even give you a bit of gold for it.
62982,What do you want? Haven't you done enough damage to Markarth?
62986,"Especially for a new whelp, you should choose your words more carefully."
62993,"So, is this what it's come to? You'd have your own flesh and blood hanged just to solidify your grip as the next Jarl?"
62996,I don't think so. Clean up your own mess.
62997,For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!
62998,"There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic. "
63000,"Keep digging! Ugh... If Lu'ah Al-Skaven can raise an army of Draugr, then why do I have to babysit them?"
63001,They invented machines and built elaborate underground cities where they researched powers to rival the gods themselves.
63002,"And with the rebels thinking us occupied elsewhere for the time being, we'll be able to take them by surprise."
63004,Good enough.
63005,My pa says elves are bad and not to trust 'em.
63007,I also hope that this is the last time we'll need to discuss this.
63009,This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.
63010,"How... How do I know you're telling me the truth, and not just what I want to hear?"
63014,You're headed to Whiterun.
63016,Falkreath is a hard place and tending a farm here is thankless work.
63017,Steward Hemming Black-Briar at your service.
63018,"If you run across any enemy couriers, take them down, and bring me whatever they're carrying."
63019,"Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin."
63020,"And I could absorb the spirit of poor, dead Barbas. He'd still be reunited with me."
63021,"Orgnar, this is it. The inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back here."
63022,Now maybe we can put all this behind us.
63028,"And the Imperial Legion needs your help, especially now, with that dragon out there somewhere, and Ulfric back on the loose."
63029,"Business is absolutely booming, my friend."
63031,"But, never mind all that. What brings you out this way?"
63032,"I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me, and point me at the enemy."
63038,"Speak with the Unemployed Laborer at the Frostfruit Inn, in Rorikstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood."
63040,Can we at least go to the tavern for supper?
63041,"There's an entrance down by the canal, but I'd highly advise you stay out of there... its the Thieves Guild's territory."
63047,"Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you."
63048,"The pain's a little less than before, but it still hurts bad enough."
63049,Seems we're all branded villains these days...
63050,"The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam."
63052,Where'd you stash it?
63053,"Bye, now."
63055,"Hush, Vulwulf... let the boy speak."
63056,"Ah, so now my dear Pelagius can hate himself for being legitimately afraid of things that actually threaten his existence..."
63061,"Narfi's happy now. Maybe Narfi can sleep. Sleep all night. Sleep, sleep, sleep."
63062,"Others returned home after the Red Year, when Vvardenfell erupted and caused much destruction."
63065,"That is the true meaning of ""Yol."" Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power is inert without action and choice."
63066,"What? Nightingales? But, I always assumed they were just a tale... a way to keep the young footpads in line."
63071,Anyone seen entering or leaving? Any strange lights or unusual noises?
63074,Meet the brothers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.
63076,Good job out there. Glad you were with us.
63078,What's happened to the Gildergreen is a travesty.
63079,The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary. 
63080,"Living outside the walls is a risk, aye. But at least the guards don't come nosin' around."
63084,"They'll think twice before coming back here, that's for sure!"
63085,Margret. He... he killed her. Right in front of me.
63086,"I have a lot of respect for Ambarys Rendar, but his views are a little extreme."
63088,Citizen. You have been warned. You leave me no choice but to resort to violence.
63089,This one needs something?
63090,"You go on your way now, girl."
63091,I warned you. You leave me no choice but violence.
63092,I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike anything we've seen before.
63094,"I am but a humble instrument of Sithis. Our Dread Father guides me. Therefore, failure is an impossibility."
63095,"Tell you what. You release me, and I promise my associates won't hunt you down like an animal and butcher you in the street. It's a win-win."
63096,Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal.
63097,"The Dominion recognized the heresy of proclaiming Talos a god. Talos was a great man, and a great Emperor... but that does not make him a god."
63101,"I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe."
63103,"A servant? Enlisting in the Stormcloaks? Ah, Bulfrek, that's why I like having you about. You're always good for a laugh."
63105,"It just so happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and together see if you can't overpower the caravan."
63106,"Keep going, Casimir! Release the Miasma!"
63107,I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun.
63108,"Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents."
63109,Do the men you killed haunt you? Mine do...
63110,I suppose you're right... they say it gets easier...
63111,"Well, where is it? Forgive me, but I don't dare just trust your word, no matter who you are."
63114,Get 'em! Kill 'em!
63115,"I remember you... you were with us at Helgen, and Whiterun. Glad to have you with us. How are you?"
63116,I'm not sure if that's a good thing...
63117,"She trusts you, at least to some extent. She sent you after us, and has no reason to think that you'd do anything other than that."
63120,I have to admit. This is more fun that I thought it'd be.
63121,"I can't remember the last time I visited home. Think I've forgotten what a proper bed looks like, let alone feels like."
63123,"Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Stormcloaks, join forces for just a little while, and take care of some of these dragons?"
63124,Focus on the mission.
63126,What do you know about soul gems?
63127,Get over to Morthal. We're mounting our final attack!
63130,"Brelyna, my dear, why don't you search for warding magics. Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them."
63131,Get over to Riften. We're mounting our final attack!
63134,"Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer may be blind, but they can still hear us."
63135,That's it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
63136,"If the gods are merciful, they've found a safe place to hide in the city."
63137,Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.
63138,I thought it was finally going to be a quiet day.
63139,"I'll be damned if I'm going to lose her to... well, to whatever they are."
63141,Ready to give up?
63142,You can't go to a party at the Thalmor Embassy dressed like that.
63143,My boyfriend died. Things won't be the same without him.
63144,"Shout for Odahviing from the Dragonsreach courtyard. After that, it's up to you."
63145,"Have you heard about Aventus Aretino? He's a little boy, lives in Windhelm. They say he's been trying to get in touch with the Dark Brotherhood..."
63147,"Please, make yourself at home!"
63149,The moisture in the air is better for the ingredients. It isn't every day that you get your hands on fresh nirnroot or painted troll fat.
63151,Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.
63152,You there! You look like a sympathetic soldier. I require your assistance!
63153,Why you little filcher...
63156,You thieving little elf!
63159,You've decided to help?
63162,"I once performed the entirety of the Poetic Edda from atop Bard's Leap before trying my luck... Well, you can see how that turned out."
63163,"Spirits! Ghosts! I am cursed, haunted, and I can do nothing. Can you fix that?"
63164,Gather 'round all!
63165,"Yeah, got to admit that little jester is good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as good as I got."
63166,I need to send someone out to do a little recruiting. There's someone in particular I'd like to join us.
63167,I'll tell you why you won't tell me. Because you were absolutely right not to.
63168,Will you spare a few coins to help someone who's got nothing?
63170,"It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. Stick it in, give it a twist, and the stuff will just flow out."
63171,"Steward Falk, I have a task for you."
63172,"Hmm? Sorry, I was lost in thought. I'm planning my wedding, you see. So many details to work out."
63174,I'll begin preparations. Thank you again so much for this.
63180,You really think the Staff of Magnus is the key?
63182,J'zargo is sure this is the end. And this was supposed to be a safe place...
63185,Whoa. Hope you know what you're doing with those flames there.
63187,"Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it."
63190,"Please, whatever you did, just make it stop!"
63192,"I was quite surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough, but their line of questioning made me... uneasy."
63194,"Well, this certainly won't help our image."
63196,Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of completing my magnum opus on the subject.
63198,I should bash your face in after all you've done.
63199,The Imperials are here. All lined up pretty-like in their shiny armor. We'll put a few dents in those bastards before we give up the city. Move it! 
63200,"Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?"
63205,"If you need help drawing some blood, let me know."
63206,Good business for the East Empire Company means all the more gold for the Empire.
63209,"You have done admirably, little one."
63215,I'm going to go get it right now and wear it. Many thanks!
63216,"Just please, don't harm anyone. I couldn't bear the thought."
63217,"Mirabelle, would you please make sure my schedule is clear for the next few days? I'm working on something important."
63219,"Some people don't think I'm smart. Those people get my fist. But you, I like."
63225,Pigsticker like that's not going to get you far. Best visit the blacksmith.
63226,"Let's just call it a ""difference of opinion"" with the College."
63228,"All eyes are on you, lad. Don't disappoint us."
63229,Oh... not at the moment. Maybe later. Don't go far.
63231,How kind of you. And I've brought an army to give you a going away parade.
63235,"I used some contacts in the Legion, asked some questions. Was told I should mind my own business."
63240,Who knows how many spies the Empire has sent into our midst already. We're at war. This isn't the time for hospitality.
63241,Is there something I do for you?
63242,The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him.
63243,"Did you have any questions about the museum, or would you rather talk business?"
63244,"I thank you again, friend. You've given me my life back."
63246,"If you need potions, head over to Angeline's Aromatics."
63247,"Why, I once fought alongside your father when we were both younger. Saved him from getting his fool head sliced off."
63249,Can I interest you in anything? Some fine armor perhaps?
63250,Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
63251,"Karliah didn't even want it, she wanted to keep the sale a secret. I can see how well that went."
63252,Verner used to love exploring before we got married. Now he's become a bit of a milk drinker. Likes to stay home.
63253,And you are...?
63254,Best put your other tasks aside. The real challenge is about to begin.
63256,And the outpost at Dragon Bridge?
63257,"Just as long as you don't breathe on me, Hjorunn. I'll be out for hours."
63261,"I'll make an exception for you, but do not bring anything out when you leave. Too many dark deeds transpired in those halls..."
63262,"Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich."
63265,My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind.
63267,How disappointing.
63269,Our business has concluded and you're standing in my way.
63271,"But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud."
63273,"Consider this. What greater glory than to serve the Emperor and his citizens here in Skyrim, in these days of greatest need?"
63275,And if I were you I'd hurry. I've never seen him this angry before.
63278,I was Dengier's personal guard for years. I risked my hide more than once to protect him.
63279,Hunh!
63281,"So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive."
63283,Come here a second.
63285,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's my boy!
63286,"We gather here today, under Mara's loving gaze, to bear witness to the union of two souls in eternal companionship."
63287,Bored!
63288,"I mean, really. Here you stand, before Sheogorath himself, Daedric Prince of Madness, and all you deem fit to do is... deliver a message? How sad."
63289,We're not just fighting Imperials. We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king she deserves.
63290,I can't do this all on my own. Are you... are you offering to help me?
63291,Were you now?
63293,Enough to make a significant difference in the war.
63294,"If Ulfric's making a move for Whiterun, then we need to be there to stop him. "
63298,That's certainly unusual.
63300,Everyone's been talking about you. The guards will have to answer for throwing an innocent person in Cidhna Mine.
63301,But don't you get it? She thought he was a troll!
63303,"I called it home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the Hagravens that live here. So was she."
63307,"In the ancient tongue, you are Dovahkiin - Dragonborn!"
63308,My husband Bersi will be the death of me. He spends too much time worrying about Riften and not enough about himself.
63309,I suppose it's time I give him an answer...
63310,But how would you know it's real?
63311,"We just received word that somebody tried to kill the Emperor! Turned out to just be his double, but can you imagine if he had succeeded?"
63313,"Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad."
63316,Need some gold? I may have some work for you.
63317,"Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is."
63319,"Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor. My belly is full of the souls of your fellow mortals, Dovahkiin."
63321,"Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend.  Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?"
63322,I can't believe it! Grelod is dead! She's really dead!
63323,Talos guide you.
63327,"That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here, until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world."
63328,You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend. Could you?
63332,But tomorrow. Definitely.
63333,It ain't true what they say about you and... and the Dark Brotherhood? Is it?
63335,"Ah, there it is! This little gold delight is going to keep us afloat for a while. Thank you. Here's something for your hard work."
63337,"It's just a dream, child. Nothing more."
63338,You're that Mage from the College. Right? Hear things have finally calmed down over there.
63342,I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.
63344,"Damn it, Proventus. I've got war lurking just outside my gates, and this is what you offer me? This? Begone."
63345,Try and hit the right target.
63346,The Thalmor Embassy welcomes you.
63347,"By the Divines, I'm tired."
63348,"Wonder what kinds of things they've got the Dibella doing, over in the temple. Mostly praying, I reckon..."
63350,"You'll need to use spells to do that. Being from the College, I assume you know them already."
63352,"Make yourself at home, please. Let me know if I can be of any assistance."
63353,You're that one from the College. Heard about you.
63354,"First, we've learnt the whereabouts of an Imperial cur fetching documents for his master in Solitude. We need to put a muzzle on that, don't we?"
63356,Go away. I have more important things on my mind right now.
63357,"It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?"
63358,"Ah, now that's a fine shield. And not mere Dwarven... is it?"
63361,"Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Now get going."
63362,Elenwen is a formidable woman. She lacks for neither cunning nor ambition.
63363,That armor... it's like nothing I've ever seen. Like forged midnight...
63364,"There's nothing a man can do that I can't do better, whether it's serving drinks or slaying trolls."
63365,"Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more."
63366,"I doubt he's forgiven me for leaving. And for... well, for what he'd consider blasphemy. Using Shouts for anything but worship of Kynareth."
63367,"Favor a steel sword, do ya? Good choice for slashing or stabbing."
63368,"Constance, sometimes she gives me little snacks. Which is good, 'cause we only get but one meal. Late, too, in the afternoon."
63371,You're the one casts those illusions. Impressive.
63373,"Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings."
63377,No lollygaggin'.
63378,"I heard the Gourmet is hiding out somewhere in Skyrim. You know, fella who wrote that cookbook."
63381,"Really, Arniel? Because I seem to recall doing just that for you recently, at which point you assured me that you'd cover my expenses."
63383,Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called.
63384,The last few supply caravans have been attacked... by a giant. As if I didn't have enough to deal with. Need that damn hairy brute straightened out.
63385,She wanted to play with me forever and ever.
63390,Trouble?
63391,The Imperials think we need their laws. Pfft.
63392,So I mostly sweep and shovel. You got a problem with that?
63393,I'm truly grateful. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
63394,The real work happens in places like this. Blood and sweat is what makes the world turn.
63397,But no one wanted to believe. Believe they even existed.
63399,"Haelga, we need to stop seeing each other."
63401,Like... with the little girl.
63406,It's just the market rabble. We should get back to work.
63407,"Almost anyone in Riften is in dire need of those missives. Speak to them, child. You will know who will listen and who will sin."
63408,Petra! Petra! Curse her eyes!
63409,Disappointing.
63411,Why should I want anything? Why can't I simply be sociable with my colleagues?
63414,"I'm not exactly built for manual labor. Now come on, you've almost got it."
63416,"The ""Great War""... there was nothing great about it. Thousands died on both sides, and where did it get us?  "
63417,Keep the guard alert. I want to make sure no townspeople get hurt if there's trouble.
63418,Carrots? Really? Okay...
63425,Keep an eye on the sky. This is only going to get worse.
63429,I always have bedlam jobs. Just remember to hit them fast and don't let them see you. Feel like going for it?
63430,What's she on about?
63433,I hear you found some... thing in Saarthal. You think it could help make me a powerful mage?
63436,Razelan. What are you doing?
63438,"Uh, right. Maybe just one of the popular songs, like ""The Slaying of the Falmer Princes""?"
63439,"Alright, let's see if we have something here to end this as quickly as possible."
63442,Trouble is in the air here.
63448,"Is there anything you need, dearest?"
63449,"Ah... How my heart soars to look upon a sister Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?"
63450,"By the Eight, keep your voice down! Do you want the entire village to learn our secrets? "
63453,Styrr says she's still in spirit form or we'd all be dead already.
63454,"Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with the dangers ahead of you."
63455,"I'm not sure yet. I have a few ideas, but I'll need some time to pull things together..."
63456,There is murder in the air. I can taste it.
63458,Why you...
63459,"Sinderion made it his life's work, developing all sorts of interesting concoctions."
63460,Four of the guards have already decided they're in love with me. Two of the guards got into a fight over me at the tavern.
63464,Get in there and push!
63465,"Help us get through this, will you? We're throwing everything we have at it."
63466,"Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every deal I handle."
63468,"The Emperor himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly unlimited resources... so don't get their feathers in a ruffle."
63470,"Please, visit me at my home. I can tell you the whole story."
63471,As if Skyrim didn't have enough outsiders. Now we've got mercenaries from Hammerfell struttin' about...
63472,"Frabbi, my dear loving wife, could you please clean out our guest rooms?"
63473,"Oh, and don't mind my assistant here. He may have seen better days, but he's still more help to me dead than he was alive."
63474,Hmph. Good. That'll teach 'em.
63476,"The cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying."
63477,Nnyyyaarrgghh!
63478,That's it. I'm placing you under arrest.
63479,"Please, please. I need but a septim. A septim is all I ask. Is that so bad?"
63481,I certainly hope so. I don't know how long we can keep this up.
63484,"Listen, I'm going to lay up here for a while. You can make your own way to Solitude from here."
63486,Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.
63489,Go ahead. Eat.
63491,We will sate the hunger together.
63492,"Sadly, they're proving elusive but I have confidence that Maven won't give up until this city has been rid of them all."
63494,Who... who are you? What's going on?
63495,The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into a opening atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man.
63496,Whew. That was close.
63497,"To this day I've regretted allowing her to escape, even if it meant I had died trying. I owed Gallus that much."
63498,That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.
63500,She was a stubborn Dunmer... always had to do everything her way.
63501,What is it you want?
63503,"That'll come in handy, yeah? An alchemy station, maybe a little garden with some choice plants. All right, consider it done."
63506,Good job!
63507,"Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know."
63511,"Hey, someone had to take it, right?"
63512,"I remember one morning, long time ago, I woke up and the place was run by some Orcs. Went to bed that night, it was all vampires. Don't matter to me."
63515,"But there isn't any other way through, Legate."
63517,Mama said I could help with the goats!
63519,We were stopped in Helgen when we were attacked... by a dragon.
63522,"All my life. I practically grew up in the Hall. My father and mother were the priest and priestess of Arkay before me, you see."
63525,"I don't know, I don't know!"
63526,"Hmm? Oh, sorry. My mind wanders sometimes. I was just thinking about Finn's Lute."
63527,"Welcome, brother. Please, enjoy yourself."
63530,Ain't nothing for it. They're still in charge.
63531,So be it.
63532,Yes...
63534,"Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled."
63535,Just got a tip on this house... should be stuffed with loot. Care to head over there and find out?
63537,It does. The College has caused enough problems; don't need you or anyone else adding to them.
63539,"Here's something to consider, Mirabelle."
63541,That is one... big hammer.
63545,Please tell him to leave me alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to him than I would.
63547,You! You hurt my family. I don't like when my family gets hurt. Say you're sorry. Or say goodbye.
63549,"But thanks to you, he died knowing his life's work was not in vain."
63554,Nothing to do here but drink till you forget you got nothing to do.
63555,Drive that snowback to the ground. Come on!
63556,Viarmo is trying to get Elisif to allow the Burning of King Olaf. I don't want to look like I don't know how to drink in front of the other bards.
63557,Who taught you to fight? Keep those hands up!
63558,Come on. Let's see what you're made of.
63559,I'll find some way to finish my book.
63560,You mean Sibbi? You must be joking! All he wants to do is bed you and be done with it. You may as well get it over with and let him.
63561,Have I made myself clear?
63562,I am that which you have been seeking.
63563,"The owner of this shop stiffed us on their last protection payment, but we're taking it anyway. You want to help us on this one?"
63570,"Not my problem. Not even a little. Take it to Tolfdir, he's supposed to be looking after you lot."
63571,Huh? That sounds ominous. Are you getting yourself into even more trouble?
63572,"For your sake, I hope your took that armor from a dead Imperial scout..."
63573,What a foul and unnatural weapon you wield. Never have I seen its like.
63574,"Then, finally, realization and horror arrive together. The orange is flame, heat. The sound a roar, a challenge in their ancient tongue."
63575,Get the job done and get back alive. That's all there is to it.
63576,I am beyond your pathetic attempts at magic. You cannot touch me.
63580,"More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you specifically."
63581,"Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation."
63584,What do you need?
63587,"Also, if your ward isn't negated by an incoming spell, it will recharge itself after a moment or two."
63590,The Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things. I can't be a part of that.
63591,Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise!
63593,Nuh...
63594,"No, it.. it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades."
63595,Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?
63599,That's quite an accusation. I assume you have proof?
63601,"Of course, on further reflection, that may have simply been an attempt to scare me. Hmm."
63603,I've said too much already.
63604,Yeah?
63605,Soon. I can almost taste it.
63606,"Actually, I was just wondering if you could make sure people are tended to if they get hurt. I'm sure you wouldn't object to that."
63607,Let's find Fjotra. This place gives me the creeps.
63608,"Crush, clobber, slash or slice. We've got a weapon for any occasion."
63609,"Oh, it's you. Come to extort more from me?"
63610,"Books. Don't know why the Imperials like these so much. This should help the boy, though, Malacath willing."
63611,A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry.
63612,I still don't see why we had to bring it back here.
63614,We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.
63617,"There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will."
63618,"Initially you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed Wizards."
63619,Agh! Dead body!
63620,Guess it's all clear now.
63621,"Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors."
63624,Don't kill me.... I don't want to die!
63628,You're going to Fort Sungard.
63629,Some take to it more than others.
63630,"Look. If you're trying to get to know me - don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But... "
63631,Tell me!
63632,Keep your eyes open.
63636,"Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to."
63637,The sealed letter you delivered to me was mysteriously unsealed upon its arrival. I can only assume you've read its contents. Sloppy...
63640,Wow! Look at that robe. Are you a wizard? 
63641,"I'd rather spend the gold on a new litter of pups, but the horses bring in more gold."
63643,What about Ulfric? Did you ever hear back from him?
63647,"If you want to help, ask some of these gawkers if they saw anything useful. "
63648,Old Hroldan is the stone that the Empire's history is built on.
63651,Are the Arch-Mage's robes as comfortable as J'zargo believes them to be?
63652,"Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying."
63653,"You should come, too."
63654,No.... Not again!
63655,"But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people."
63656,"You ask me, we'd be better off without that wizard in town."
63661,"So, life has brought you to Morthal, and to me. What purpose this serves, we will no doubt see. Welcome."
63662,Get over to Dawnstar.
63663,Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding.
63664,You'd better know how to use that weapon if you plan on swinging it around in here.
63666,"If the guards would listen to Viola, they'd have caught the Butcher by now."
63670,Brilliant!
63671,"I'm part of a group that's been looking for you... well, someone like you, for a very long time."
63672,How are you feeling?
63673,Windhelm is divided into four quarters. The Gray Quarter is the one that's home to all the city's Dark Elves.
63674,"Yes, Master Elgrim will be pleased I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients."
63677,"Pa says the Empire made us leave, but the Empire just does whatever the elves tell them to."
63678,Either that or go see the Jarl's court wizard.
63679,"Bring me whatever he's carrying, and I'll send you to Morthal with something convincing but full of lies."
63682,"To be driven from our homes, to be forced here... this is the last thing that Joric needs."
63683,Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are run out of Riften.
63684,"Never heard of them talking to anybody before. If they really do want to talk to you, you'd better go find out what they want. You never know."
63686,"Come, help me search for Fenrig."
63690,Papa says that I shouldn't keep waiting. Why not? Mama has to come home some time.
63691,Thank you. I will not forget this.
63694,Hsssss!
63697,"I just want to be left alone to do my job, and to enjoy what little free time I have when I have it."
63698,"Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit - that's fine."
63702,My wife died. Things won't be the same without her.
63703,My sources must remain a secret for their own protection but I can promise that the contents are genuine.
63705,"First of all, I need to sew confusion and doubt through the rebel troops. I want to assassinate their commanding officer."
63708,"Do you have any idea who I am? When my father hears about this, he will gut you."
63710,Many thanks. Here - a token of gratitude.
63713,The Stormcloaks can keep this city safe better than those Legion lapdogs.
63715,"I'll make sure this war ends, all right. Just as soon as the dragons swarm across Skyrim and wipe out all of you puny..."
63716,"Arise, Olaf! My vengeance is at hand!"
63719,"We welcome you to worship the Eight Divines, freely and openly."
63720,"We welcome you to worship the Nine Divines, freely and openly."
63722,"One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid."
63724,"Here, this is for you."
63725,"""Mmmhmm""? I've been working with you for over 10 years, and all you have to say is ""mmmhmm""?"
63727,The Imperials think us all lawless beasts. I'm proof of their ignorance.
63729,The front gate is locked so you'll need to use the mine entrance behind us.  Open the front gate and we'll try and give you some support.
63731,Enough talk. Let's go kill some Imperials.
63734,It's over! Everyone stop!
63737,You ready to take the Oath?
63738,Positively vulgar.
63739,Karliah always was a nimble minx... slipping passed these draugr must be child's play for her.
63740,"To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot."
63741,So you can cast a few spells. Am I supposed to be impressed?
63743,Uh oh. A fellow bard. I best not miss my notes or forget any lyrics.
63745,Glad you decided to check us out.
63748,"And if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy coincidence."
63749,We bards record history - we do not make it. You'd do well to remember that.
63750,"If you want answers, ask at the inn. She told me she was staying there."
63751,Oh?
63753,"A true killer, like me. The gods put us here to fill their halls with souls. You'll fit in fine down here."
63754,I'm fairly sure that the dragons don't care about our matters one way or the other.
63755,"I'm Dean of Lute at the Bards College, and no, I don't give private lessons."
63756,So what if I have a problem? I know how to deal with it!
63758,"Consider it forgotten, boss."
63761,Ysmir... curse you!
63762,Stormblade.
63764,"Always a pleasure, boss. What can I do for you?"
63765,Krii!
63767,"The one who sells things, what's his name. Oh, yes! Revyn Sadri. Maybe he'd know something."
63771,"Not much to it, really. We fish, and keep to ourselves. Try to keep from upsetting the Empire or the Stormcloaks, and so far the war's left us alone."
63773,"Sidgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly."
63776,"Well. Perhaps you'll at least consider it, hmm?"
63778,I'll be damned. Someone who actually escaped Cidhna Mine. You're the talk of the Warrens.
63781,Be quick. I have little patience for mundane concerns.
63782,"Jarls come and jarls go, but a good cook stays for a lifetime. And I'm a very, very good cook."
63783,"Comes down to trust, I expect. After Dengeir gave up his seat to his nephew, he didn't trust anyone."
63784,"Please. You find out why that woman was attacked, who's behind Weylin and the Forsworn, and I'll pay you for any information you bring me."
63786,I suppose someone else will need to look after the Apprentices for now.
63787,Ah yes. I've studied those documents... Very interesting...
63789,"I said, on your knees, Elf!"
63790,Sounds good. Be careful.
63791,"The mead is same as it ever was and the meat is fresh, maybe your sense of taste has ""gone off."""
63792,"Fine, I'll just save myself then. Thank you for letting me out of that cage."
63793,Either of you?
63799,"True enough, you cur. Back to work, I suppose..."
63802,"For it will be Skyrim that shall lead Tamriel in those dark days, when the fate of the world is finally determined."
63803,You could see that if you had any faith left in that black heart of yours.
63805,"I try to do my little part. Besides, just between you and me, it's making me pots of money, hahaha."
63806,"Skilled, lethal and good-looking. Yep, it's a curse."
63807,"Move along, now."
63809,"I hail from Cyrodiil, but after a... misunderstanding with the law, I needed a swift change of scenery."
63811,"I'm still trying to find a suitable contract for you. Continue to work with Nazir on the, um, supplemental assignments."
63815,What should we do?
63816,"If break-ins are more your thing, go talk to Vex."
63817,"Talos bless you, my child."
63819,"Alduin, thuri! Boaan tiid vokriiha suleyksejun kruziik?"
63824,You dare challenge me?
63825,I've been a part of this Guild for as long as Mercer has been Guild Master.
63827,You just made the last mistake of your life!
63828,Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
63832,How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself.
63833,"That's the trouble. I know Faleen from the Keep, but I have no idea what sorts of things she likes."
63835,You're losing a lot of blood. Maybe you should sit down for a moment.
63837,"After twenty years of fighting, she had raised armies of the dead, led by vampire generals. If she returns to power, nobody could stop her."
63838,There's a smart lad. Take the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
63839,That's what I'm here for. What are you offering?
63840,"Now, take Shagrol's hammer back to Largashbur, and we'll see about whipping the rest of them into shape."
63843,Hahahaha!
63844,I'll enjoy killing you!
63845,That's not something you see every day...
63847,"Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the Thalmor."
63849,Find out what's happening in the Hall of the Dead. Arkay will watch over you.
63850,"I give you my ring. Wear it, and when you feast on the flesh of the dead, I will grant you my power."
63853,I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.
63854,Leave me alone!
63858,"I wish I could afford to pay you both, Narri.  I really do."
63859,"I'm just doing my duty, sir."
63860,"To think, my little boy is married. And to an Imperial. Oh, they grow up so fast."
63861,"Working our mine is dangerous work, but Dravynea keeps it going. Well, Dravynea and the promise of more mead."
63866,"You'll do all right some day. Today you need to keep training, though."
63868,"The East Empire Company has interests all across Tamriel, inside and outside the Empire's borders. We try not to get involved in politics."
63871,"Being an admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research a secret."
63874,"Need supplies? See Belethor at his store. Sleazy little man, but he has good stock."
63875,"Alright, you are now under arrest."
63876,Seems there's no end to the needs of the Imperials. But what can I help you with?
63877,I heard the College teaches you how to kill people with magic. Is that true?
63880,"Greetings, sister."
63885,Someone has killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
63886,"Aretino? Why that little bastard! You tell him I'm coming for him! And when I find him, it will be the beating of his miserable life!"
63887,"Wouldn't ever have expected to wind up living in a place like this, but the money's good."
63888,"I'd always intended Mercer's fate to ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken."
63890,"What'cha doing in Left Hand? Do you dig up rocks too, like my mom?"
63893,"Tell Erik that I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor. And please don't hurt me!"
63897,"Last, and only for the bravest of souls, we have the ""Cliff Racer"" which is Firebrand Wine, Cyrodiilic Brandy, Flin and Sujamma."
63898,Tread carefully.
63899,"They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their one weakness is flame."
63900,What's not to get? It's as simple as Traven's First Axiom of Magic... or was it Galerion's Law of Casting. Hmm.
63901,Razelan. What is it this time?
63902,Kill him!
63905,(Growling)
63907,Of course not. I never thought otherwise.
63908,"Sorry, I don't mean to be rude but Jouane's the one who deals with people. I'm afraid I lost my charm years ago."
63910,G...Gavros? Is that you?
63912,Again? Buy some food this time will you?
63913,"Everything well, Jesper?"
63917,I wish I had more contracts to dole out. You handled those jobs like a born killer.
63918,This had better be important. 
63919,Who do you think brought Septimus here? Who do you think protected you on your journey to open the box and loose my knowledge on this world?
63921,"So, can I interest you in anything today?"
63922,Do whatever you're going to do before it kills us all!
63923,"If Ulfric had asked Torygg directly to stand up, to declare independence, Torygg might have done it."
63930,"Yes, my Jarl. We could hardly waste anyone else's precious time on such a tedious task."
63931,"If you're looking to purchase goods, I have none to sell. You should head into Riften instead."
63933,Your muscles ripple when you work the forge. It's pleasing.
63935,"Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus."
63936,"The most dangerous sort of man -- quick to anger, but patient in exacting vengeance."
63937,We'll speak again later. If we must...
63938,Who are you? What are you doing here?
63939,"This was the first door in Skyrim I knocked upon, and little did I know my future husband would be answering the door."
63941,"Well, right. One of us will be a chief."
63943,Have you ever heard of such a thing? A Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
63945,"Annekke used to help more with the mining, but nowadays she's a bit of a bounder."
63946,I traveled far and wide when I was younger. Glad to have settled down finally.
63948,Yield!
63949,Think about your choices carefully from now on. You'll go much farther in Riften with me on your side.
63953,I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions.
63954,Oho! Not so fast!
63959,Ha! You caught me!
63960,Great. What do you want to do?
63962,"The cold, frightening truth is that the Empire represents progress. Anyone who fears progress is a coward. "
63964,"I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable."
63965,"We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself."
63966,"Ah, there you are."
63968,Where did you find this?
63969,Your performance has been excellent lately Aia. You still need training but one day you will make an adequate singer.
63970,My husband Mathias and I tend Corpselight Farm.
63972,I eat Legionnaires like you for breakfast!
63975,Which other one?
63976,"One day I hope to become a painter, but at this rate it looks like it's never going to happen."
63977,This is the last hagraven between us and my mother!
63979,This mine will be our grave yet. I just know it.
63981,"Well, I'm ""not a scholar"" of architecture. And that's that."
63984,"Running out of room, eh? I'll be glad to help."
63986,I'm betting bodies. Lots and lots of bodies. And maybe some valuables...
63987,"But please, don't leave. You've been instrumental in this process. I'd like you to see the results first-hand."
63988,Oh my word!
63990,Are you so sure of that? I think Birna might disagree with you.
63991,"As long as he keeps paying, I suppose. He keeps to himself, and isn't hurting anyone."
63992,"But, give me... just a moment... I must gather a few things..."
63993,"Oh, yes. It's all been foretold. The end has begun. Alduin has returned."
63995,"Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now, he devours the souls of your fallen comrades!"
63996,"I say, you didn't hear any loud noises last night, did you? No, ahh... explosion sounds?"
63997,Really? You convinced that lute player to stop chasing me?
64000,"How much of our money have you spent today, Ranmir? Anything left, or is it all gone?"
64002,"I see. Well, perhaps you'll take pity on a humble priest who has lost something precious."
64005,"What happened is between you, me, and Azura. Let's keep it that way."
64009,"Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?"
64013,For hundreds of years it's been shut away from the world. Septimus was a useful tool for unleashing it.
64014,"Go forth. Do the biddings of Septimus, for he is working my will in your plane."
64015,You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?
64017,"Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her."
64019,For the Night Mother!
64026,Now something's happening to bring them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
64027,"Put that down, you mangy cat!"
64029,"I... it's true, isn't it? You really are Dragonborn."
64031,"Forgive me, but at what point does it become our concern?"
64033,You ready to hear me out?
64035,You bear my ring.
64038,Huh?
64039,The Greybeards seem to think you're the Dragonborn. I hope they're right.
64041,"That old woman who runs the orphanage has been murdered. Say, didn't I see you coming out of there...? "
64042,Someone was attacked in the market. Do you know who it was?
64043,I'm not allowed to stand on furniture.
64044,I'll be here when you're done.
64046,Amazing that such beauty could exist in a place as desolate as the volcanic tundra.
64047,Can I help you with anything else?
64052,"Yes, indeed. An entire caravan shipment of your mead taken by Imperial soldiers. What of it?"
64053,"Besides, it will be good to see High Hrothgar again."
64054,Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?
64055,"By the gods, is that the Voice?"
64056,Those words have such power!
64057,What sort of power was that?
64059,S'rendarr's mercy!
64060,Are you a Greybeard?
64061,"No! Please, grandmother, don't do that. I'm fine. Really. Can we just... not talk about this anymore?"
64062,What do you want? Can't people leave us alone?
64068,"If you beat up my sister Sissel, I won't tell."
64070,Well done...
64071,"Captain Lonely-Gale, it's always a pleasure to see you."
64072,"You are speaking to Larak, chief of Mor Khazgur."
64073,Both my daughters. Now my wife? How much is one man supposed to take?
64074,"You should see my forge-wife, Shuftharz, if you need weapons or armor."
64075,Poisons can kill your enemies faster than any blade.
64077,"Shuftharz can forge you some armor, outlander."
64080,Gah! Let's get on with it already!
64081,"The Legion could really use someone like you, especially now."
64082,Mother tells me to shape metal with focus and strength.
64084,"Dorian is helping me perfect my fencing, but I don't think I'll ever be as good as he is."
64086,"Oh, now we're all please and thank you, are we?"
64087,"Do they, my chief? Am I now favored enough to replace Shel by your side at the feast? Back your words with action!"
64088,"Ours is to follow, friend."
64094,I'll tell you what. You help me get the treasure and I'll split it with you. Deal?
64101,You know what? You're not worth the hassle. Go... be some other guard's problem.
64102,I'm getting out of here!
64104,Gods! Another fight.
64106,"Good luck, Nightingale."
64109,Off we go.
64110,"If you have any news of the western holds, take it to Ulfric immediately."
64112,Hrm. You go find your own wreck. This one's mine.
64113,"Oh goodness, someone's going to get killed."
64116,Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit.
64117,"You should see that Orc over in Understone Keep, have him forge you some new armor..."
64119,You have questions?
64120,Do the Falmer also have no sense of smell? This place reeks!
64122,It's Mercer! Look... down there!
64123,"A gate guard who let Ulfric Stormcloak escape the city, after he killed the High King."
64124,"By order of the Jarl, I command you to halt!"
64126,"I have never doubted that, husband."
64127,I... I've been trying to find the time and place to let her know.
64130,"Giving up Riften is a heavy price to pay for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it."
64131,What in the name of Oblivion is going on in this place?
64133,Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he cut through the elven hordes that once swarmed this land.
64134,Just keep swinging!
64137,"Don't reach for a shiv around me, or we'll both regret it."
64140,Paarthurnax has made the decision to help you. This is the road we have to walk.
64141,"What's happening? Damn it, what are you doing?"
64142,"I've seen every corner of Skyrim, but nothing is as beautiful as the battlefield."
64144,Olaf! It is time!
64146,You're pathetic!
64150,Of course.
64152,Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
64155,"Hungry, tired, or just plain thirsty?"
64156,"Brilliant, I know. It's a gift."
64157,"Thongvor's made me his housecarl. Remember, me killing you is legal."
64161,"Skuli owns the inn with his mother gone, but I handle the rooms."
64164,"I wasn't aware that Lisbet was having trouble, Cosnach. Is Arnleif and Sons not doing a good turn of business these days?"
64165,"Be careful in there, you can take a nasty spill."
64167, 
64169,I'd still keep an eye on my purse if I was you.
64170,"A book of mine. I was at least halfway through, and wanted to finish it, but apparently I put it down somewhere."
64171,"No time, I have business to conduct."
64173,Nobody ever expects a fireball from the darkened corner.
64174,"As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist. "
64178,"Come on, we'd better get moving."
64180,These workers. Always complaining. Always excuses.
64183,"Hey, you don't look so good..."
64186,"Patience, boy."
64189,I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within the Dreamstride.
64190,We've got troubles enough without the Thalmor and their witch-hunts.
64191,The artifacts I've discovered in Nchuand-Zel will make history one day.
64193,"Before you say anything, no, I am not from the Reach."
64194,Now you're speaking my language.
64200,"Couldn't help but notice, that, um... you dropped some armor. Just wanted to check with you before I took it. Is that all right?"
64201,"Beware the region northeast, across the river. Forsworn have taken refuge in Broken Tower Redoubt and Red Eagle Redoubt."
64202,It seems those tales are true.
64204,"So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?"
64206,"You heading up to High Hrothgar soon, Klimmek?"
64207,Maybe he's looking for something to eat?
64208,"Oh my, old Ma'zaka has a visitor!"
64209,"Look at him, rummaging through refuse. Wonder what he's lost... besides his mind."
64210,It's so nice to have a visitor.
64212,"Divines smile on you, friend."
64214,I'll let Viarmo take possession but I will be looking forward to adding this to our library. Good work.
64215,"I'll remember that when the Stormcloaks liberate the city. No amount of money will protect you then, Battle-Born."
64216,"If there's anything I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to call upon me!"
64218,There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.
64219,"As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests of Vaermina, or the unaffiliated."
64223,"Shahvee knows the dock doesn't look nice, but fresh air is good for the gills."
64224,It's all we've got for today. Don't be greedy.
64227,Ulfric Stormcloak was a true hero of Skyrim. He stood up to the Thalmor and refused to turn his back on Talos.
64228,Spare a coin? Talos rewards the generous.
64230,Yergh!
64231,"Torbjorn wants the shipping operations to bring in cash, and I make it happen."
64233,"Wait, hear my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot bring him back!"
64236,"Rest up, scum. Probably getting executed tomorrow."
64237,What can I do for you?
64238,"Because even if we can't openly worship him, Talos the god was once Tiber Septim the man, and this is his Empire."
64239,"Very well, I'll keep practicing them."
64240,"I spend so much time among the dead, I sometimes forget how much I miss the company of the living."
64241,The task of Steward is more important than you realize. The Jarl often asks for my invaluable council.
64243,"I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all of this?"
64244,"It's a new day in Windhelm. The Stormcloaks are gone, and so is their prejudice."
64245,Well. Good! You favor the Empire less than I feared. Maybe we will be able to come to some agreement here after all.
64247,"Look, we don't have much love for your kind down here. Probably best if you just left."
64248,Well I'm glad you were there. I don't know how I would have gotten past the Forsworn without you.
64249,Unngh...  Uhhh...
64251,"I'm not much of a strategist, but Lord Ulfric listens to my counsel all the same."
64253,"Oh, yes please!"
64255,I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?
64256,"Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you'd visit us again."
64257,"In joining the Legion, you'll be taking an oath binding you to the service of the Emperor and thus to every citizen of the Empire."
64258,"Mother, I finished cutting at the northern stand. Where do I move on to now?"
64263,"I leave all that sneaking around nonsense to everyone else; believe me, when I'm coming for you... you'll know it."
64264,There's two kinds of Pit fighters -- good ones and dead ones.
64266,"I've spent my life serving Talos. I don't plan to stop now, no matter what the Empire says."
64267,I don't think there's a need for that!
64269,Maven! So good to see you again. Hoist a flagon and celebrate with me!
64272,"Being a Jarl isn't something I ever wanted, but if I can help these people, then I will."
64273,"Welcome to the House of Curiosities! I offer a brief tour for a few coins, or you can simply browse at your leisure."
64275,"When I'm cutting wood, I pretend there's an Imperial soldier's head on the stump."
64276,Very well. Just be careful!
64277,I hope you haven't arrived here looking for work in the mine.
64280,How are the little ones?
64281,The best way for us to win the Nords' respect is through hard work.
64282,Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
64285,I've no problem with Orcs. But that stronghold they've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
64286,"Many condemn the Stormcloaks, but I refuse. There is honor in fighting for what you believe."
64288,I wish you didn't hate him so much... I wish the whole family could be together again.
64289,"So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone."
64290,"It's good to see you, too, Esbern. It's been too long, old friend. Too long."
64291,Lead us to our next task.
64294,"I just need you to go out there, look tough, and scare this milk drinker into submission."
64295,Did I ever tell you about the day when Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger?
64296,Ha! Then I'm right. I knew it. He's trying to have somebody killed!
64297,I see you are eager to carry the light.
64298,"So walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!"
64299,"They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever they can."
64300,Ha! Now that I would like to see. I may go back there some day.
64301,"There's a foul presence coming from Darklight Tower, southwest of the city. Some say the place is home to necromancers. "
64304,"Excellent. I'll send the proper letters, then, and have some fresh horses delivered straightaway."
64307,Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back.
64308,Gracious! This one is certainly unaccustomed to such sights...
64309,Well now! Aren't you putting on quite the show?
64316,Then you're on.
64317,Good luck. And try not to get yourself killed.
64318,He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole.
64320,Good dog.
64322,Interest you in some marksman training?
64324,You just wait. My new pranks are going to the best ever! You'll see! He he he he.
64327,"It's not going to be next year, nor the year after that! You just care about this farm more than you care about me!"
64328,I don't have time to talk. Keep moving!
64329,"Help me, help me!"
64330,"How may I help you, my daughter?"
64331,Damn. Another fight.
64332,"It's been a good week, my boy! Loud customers mean good cheer, and good cheer means a full till!"
64333,I could sure use some coin.
64334,I didn't really want that anyway.
64335,Absurd that you can't get good sweet rolls in this skeeverhole of a city.
64338,"Never mind then, lad. If you change your mind, come find me."
64343,"When I'm done here, I'd be more than happy to sell you an elixir."
64344,But only if you're partial to being flayed alive and having an angry immortal skip rope with your entrails.
64348,My brother tells me you've done us a service. Thank you.
64349,"That's just it... if she's not happy, there are plenty of other women who will be."
64350,The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
64351,Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got what it takes.
64355,Come on. We need to find out what's happening up there!
64356,The men simply seek wisdom. Everything will be fine.
64357,But don't kill him. I don't hate the man. I just want him to go back to his farm and forget about me.
64358,"Wrong or right, the Mythic Dawn changed Tamriel's history. They deserve study."
64359,"What's that? Oh yes, yes. Thank you, I will."
64360,"I wouldn't have expected someone like you to be the Harbinger, but Kodlak trusted your judgment. And so will I."
64361,Sometimes I feel like Annekke cares more about finding new rocks than being with me.
64363,"Unfortunately, in your zeal, you failed to eliminate Vici while she addressed her guests, as directed. I'm sorry, but your bonus is forfeit."
64364,"That's it! I'm not retiring, ever! End of discussion!"
64365,"Tell her... tell her to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll understand."
64367,We summon Potema!
64368,I don't need your help.
64371,"Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do."
64373,The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in the hills. 
64375,"It's a foregone conclusion, you know."
64376,I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
64377,The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
64380,"Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint."
64381,"Then I thank you for showing me mercy. Here, take this coin to him. If it keeps us together, it's worth its weight."
64384,"That old place? I could care less about it. Its you I want, Bolli."
64388,There are no shipments scheduled today. Stop covering for him!
64393,"Because, because you are such a nice Breton, yes!"
64396,I... see.
64397,Umm. You got no clothes. You should get some.
64398,I... I will. Thank you...
64400,Cover yourself. Have you no shame?
64402,"All right, we've all seen enough. Put on some clothes."
64403,"First off, we've learned the location of some rebels scouting our positions throughout the hold. Need to take them out."
64405,Blessings to you. The Divines are listening.
64406,What kind of fool plays with fire like that?
64407,"He made my favorite dolly, but I can't find her."
64409,Take care with those flames.
64410,"Have a fascination with fire, do we?"
64411,Here. Take this. I hope you like it.
64412,"It's a bit worn, but I'll take it."
64413,See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
64414,"Plan on burning everything down, do you? Damn fool."
64415,You should be more careful with those flames.
64416,"Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests and no sermons, no services and no alms."
64417,Well... I suppose important research is worth every coin. All right. You have yourself a deal. How's double and a half its value in trade?
64418,Not to mention my great fondness for dragons and petty political power struggles.
64422,The Dunmer came up with the stuff a long time ago. Very illegal and very hard to come by.
64423,"Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!"
64424,I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.
64426,You bring a smile to this one's eyes and peace to his heart. Take this. A small token of appreciation.
64427,"I... I'm sorry. I just, well, the forge gets so hot and I thought...."
64428,Umm... don't suppose you'd want to take that fire somewhere else? You know... somewhere away from me?
64429,"I got this for you. It's nothing big, but I hope you like it. I want you to know I appreciate your friendship."
64430,At least it's more money for the College.
64431,"Well, that's interesting...."
64432,The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time.
64436,Do we have a deal?
64438,"When you have done so, I will unbind Hevnoraak. He will awaken in a weakened state, but the lich is still to be reckoned with. Be ready."
64441,UUggghhhh.....
64442,Don't even say such things! I hope that dragon stays away from Riverwood. We don't need that kind of trouble.
64444,"Anyway, it's done. Time to move on."
64446,But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.
64450,Yes dear.
64452,What? Raise the alarm!
64453,"Welcome, sister! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature."
64454,Yeah.
64456,You're mean. I hate you. I hate you forever and ever and ever.
64457,That is the truth.
64458,But not all can enter there. Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath the deathly rock.
64459,Let me know if I can get you anything.
64462,These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.
64464,"If the news from Helgen is true... well, there's no telling what it means."
64465,Someone stop this fool sorcerer before someone gets killed.
64467, 
64468,Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their guts on the ground before they even know we're here.
64469,"Everyone needs work, right? I have good work for you."
64470,"The Thalmor? By the Nine, it's worse than I thought."
64473,Thanks.
64474,Gods' blessings on you.
64477,Thanks a lot!
64479,"There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault."
64483,Ysmir's blessing on you.
64484,"Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?"
64485,"Steward, I will need the following reagents for my studies. Please see to them."
64486,"If my analysis is correct, the dragon buried near Kynesgrove will be the next to come back to life."
64487,This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget that she watches over us all.
64488,"Do you like horses? You  should visit the stables. I own them, you see. And our stock is excellent."
64489,Idiot! That wasn't the deal. You were just supposed to teach them a lesson. I am not paying you...
64491,Zun...
64492,You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.
64493,I'm quite pleased that we're back to business as usual.
64494,"Even with the College's laid-back attitude, there are still some things that are off-limits."
64496,"I am always available should you need me, Arch-Mage."
64497,"Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason."
64499,Faida's the name. I keep the inn.
64500,I wouldn't bother smacking at those hives with a weapon. Set 'em on fire and they'll go up like kindling.
64501,"I hope you weren't expectin' to get paid for this blundered job. Next time, the mark stays alive... you hear me?"
64510,Our access to those bits of luck are what separates us from common bandits.
64512,"May I help you, Arch-Mage?"
64517,Ysmir's beard!
64519,You should just serve your time. Find an ore vein and start digging.
64520,Milk drinker.
64521,You serve your time by digging. So dig.
64523,"I guess I got tired of handing out contracts to everyone else, while I stayed home playing den mother. It was good to get out, and have some fun."
64524,"Gunnar, take care of the boy. I have to find General Tullius and join the defense."
64526,"What do you want from me? I work for them ok? We're not friends. They pay me, and I get the job done. That's it."
64527,I need to lock the door behind you or the patrols might notice something's wrong.
64530,I brought in my cousin Cosnach to help me handle shipments.
64533,"The finest fish, here! Caught daily!"
64535,"Now I don't care about no deeds, or laws, or other nonsense like that. This house was empty, so I settled in. And now it's mine."
64538,"I was walking by the old Aretino Residence, heard the little boy, Aventus? He was chanting. It was the Black Sacrament, I tell ya."
64539,"Records showed her buying passage aboard a sailing vessel named ""The Pride of Tel Vos,"" but that's where the trail ran cold."
64540,"You must first prove your worth, and then I shall lead you across."
64541,"The Guild stocks the place full of thugs that aren't good enough to join, so watch yourself if you venture down there."
64542,"So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake."
64544,"I've been burned a few times, made a few bad deals, but mostly I come out on top."
64546,Agghh! 
64547,Perhaps now you have some insight into the forces that shape the vennesetiid... the currents of Time.
64548,Thank you so much. Here. Let me show you a thing or two about not attracting attention to yourself.
64549,"If I get any rest soon, I'll count myself richer than a king."
64550,"(Sigh) Let's just kill them both, eh? "
64551,"All right, all right. It's Karliah... her name is Karliah."
64553,Very good. Be sure to bring any more Sleeping Tree Sap you find to me.
64554,"Some of them have a long way to go, but they're mostly passable. Don't let them hear I said that, though!"
64555,I've been a lot of things in my life. Pit fighter's the one I'm best at.
64556,Get out of here or I'll call the guards!
64557,"Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses."
64558,How can Elda hate the dark elves when she knows so little about them?
64559,"Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again. I'm sorry."
64561,"Sorry friend, but it looks like you're a bit light in the purse, and the wayward minstrel can't afford to do free performances."
64562,"Word is Elenwen's furious. Big party at the Thalmor Embassy, and one of the guests went someplace they shouldn't. Caused quite a commotion."
64564,The meads won't argue your ear off about which one should go first!
64565,"I barely make enough for us to eat as it is, father. You can't just drink it all away."
64567,That's a fine potion you've put together.
64571,"It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?"
64573,We want compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
64575,"Oh, you just don't understand. Without him, I am not free! Without him, I am doomed! All of his empire shall fall into chaos..."
64577,"Possession of the holds change on an almost daily basis, but I can report that Haafingar is still secure. Your people are safe."
64579,"Really? How did we afford that? Besides, I like the gown I already have."
64580,Did you have any luck tracking own some more pitchforks?
64583,"Get back, thief!"
64585,"Don't worry, citizen. I'm on top of that little matter we discussed."
64586,Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.
64592,"It's okay, dear. More work than ever down at the blacksmith."
64597,I've heard you may actually be stronger than you look. Perhaps we can hunt together someday. 
64598,"My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that cannot be slaked!"
64599,Indeed. Being a drunken boor is thirsty work. And I can't seem to find my way back to the bar...
64600,"But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College."
64606,"Over time, I managed to gain their confidence. Then one night I grabbed a knife, waited until they fell asleep and cut their throats."
64607,"Okay, here's how this works. You try to assassinate me, and I kill you. Horribly. I have done this dance before, you know."
64613,Help! Murder!
64615,What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an argument for scholars and historians to this very day.
64618,"First is the ""Velvet Lechance"" which is a mixture of blackberry, honey, spiced wine and a touch of nightshade... perfectly safe, I assure you."
64619,"The Empire has always been good to the Orcs, but this war of theirs is none of my concern."
64624,Thought I heard something.
64625,Now here's a woman I'm glad to see.
64626,...go murder a clown.
64628,Ow... It hurts when I laugh. He he...
64632,So much energy... So much power. Never in my life have I seen something like this...
64634,Need me to carry something?
64637,Savos doesn't care for politics. He likes to believe the College is removed from the rest of Skyrim.
64638,"All right. Be quick about it, will you? This is a good way for the College to bring in some money."
64639,"You withdraw from the Pale, and allow Jarl Skald the Elder to return to Dawnstar."
64640,"Please, enjoy yourself!"
64643,"For now. The Blades' memory is long, as you know."
64646,This wedding is boring. I wish they had jugglers.
64649,I just came to sing! This is a horror show!
64650,"That's all, hmm?"
64652,"But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor."
64654,If you really want to... Just be careful of the ghost! He snuck up on me once and scared me sick. It took a week for me to feel better...
64657, 
64658,"Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast."
64659,We all have you to thank for saving the College. Your position is well-deserved.
64663,Just worry about keeping the fields tended and let the Jarl worry about the war.
64664,"The same thing we've told them before, and the same thing we've told these Stormcloaks. It's not our concern."
64665,"As soon as we drive the Empire out of Skyrim, the dragons will vanish. Mark my words."
64667,"It ain't right, movin' in with a new love the day after your kin die like that."
64668,"So, you don't need anything then."
64669,"Oh my word, this is terrible."
64670,Why you still starin' at me?
64671,"You've been spending a fair bit of time with Sergius lately, I see."
64674,"Yes, Arch-Mage. Thank you."
64675,This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim.
64676,Some fool is opening a museum in Dawnstar. They say he's paying people to collect artifacts from that old Mythic Dawn cult.
64677,I said my fine has been paid! Now let me out!
64681,"A woman -- a foreigner in these lands. Redguard, like us."
64685,"Unfortunately, we're certain he has informants within the city guard. Every time we've made a move to arrest him, he's escaped."
64687,Then let me speed your passage to Sovngarde!
64688,Is Ulfric's armor done yet?
64690,Darkness consume you!
64691,"Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now."
64694,May Azura's magic protect you.
64695,"There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages."
64697,"I'm sure the guards have the matter well in hand. Now, if you'll excuse me."
64699,"Oh, I see. Is it still too soon?"
64700,"Blast, girl, I told you to leave my tools alone. You have yours and I have mine."
64701,"We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?"
64703,"Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we?"
64704,How dare you. No one turns down cut meat from Hogni Red-Arm!
64709,"I had a dream that there was a good dragon. He was old and gray, but he wasn't scary."
64712,"You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something."
64714,"Bunch of foreign troublemakers. Wandering around, getting into mischief, scaring the citizens."
64715,Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security.
64716,"I was a different man, once -- strong, commanding, ah, and young. But the Great War was a long time ago."
64720,"I'm warning you now, this challenge will be quite difficult."
64723,"Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice, but it is written here in this scroll."
64725,But I'm lonely. Will you play with me?
64726,Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.
64727,The hofkahsejun has been known as Dragonsreach ever since.
64728,The Jarl's court wizard was taught there. That one's full of secrets.
64730,"I wasn't sure it'd ever happen. Here. I want you to have this. My way of saying ""thanks."""
64732,Everyone here is having nightmares. I have miners tripping over their own feet from lack of sleep.
64733,"One day when you and I are on the Circle, we can change how things are run around here."
64735,"Sigh... fine, take whatever you want, so long as you help me get rid of Vals."
64736,I have metal to dig.
64737,It's immoral to worship a man. And it's also illegal. A faithful Imperial citizen would know that. 
64740,Yes? What is it?
64741,"And if you want to keep having ears, you'll pretend you didn't."
64744,You! Back to inflict more pain on me?
64745,Go ahead. Take it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me.
64747,Talk to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something out of him. They're... well acquainted if you catch my meaning.
64749,Come back to gloat? I've been beaten by worse than you.
64750,"Come on, we just need a little elbow grease."
64752,Bring it on!
64753,Destroy him!
64756,I hope you're not planning to attack me again...
64757,"A solid gold ornament, in the shape of a dragon's claw."
64761,They're dead? But now everyone will think I did it!
64762,Ummm... they'd lock me up if I went around like that.
64764,"Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, she's in there!"
64765,"Not the response I was hoping for, but suit yourself."
64766,My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt Agna found me.
64768,"Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually."
64770,Tough day at the mines. I swear the ore is getting harder to dig.
64772,Is it information you want?
64773,Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were finished.
64774,Use the gloves to clear the focal points. Return to me when you have finished. I thought I made this rather clear.
64775,You're headed to Winterhold.
64776,Visiting Riften? All are welcome at the Temple of Mara.
64778,"This again? I told you we have someone standing guard out there. And, don't forget the rock trap we rigged up."
64780,"Damn it, child, didn't I tell you to gather my notes on sub-material properties?"
64781,Did they really record the star positions from Curalmil's tomb? There's no way it's that precise.
64782,Is there anything else I can get for you?
64785,I understand. I'm sorry. I just get so excited thinking about it. So... can we. Do some fire magic?
64786,"Hey, Longhammer, set us up with a round of... what in Oblivion happened in here?"
64787,"As you will, my Thane. I will protect you with my life."
64788,We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.
64796,"You heard me, captain- our work must not be disturbed."
64797,It was my pleasure. It's not often I get visitors out here. Let alone friendly ones.
64798,"No killing. I'm not hiring the Dark Brotherhood, here. If you get caught, it's not my problem."
64799,"So you like to hurt people, huh? The town is still talking about what you did."
64801,Good. Concentration is paramount when dealing with magical forces.
64802,"So, you need a guide out of town after all?"
64804,"I think you accidentally mislaid this, dear. Here you go."
64806,"She never speaks with us. She's allowed this wizard, Falion, to live in our midst practicing gods-know-what."
64807,Now I'm sitting in here counting skeever droppings while he's drinking Black-Briar mead with Maven.
64808,"Clear out the chamber, and I'll give you the key."
64811,"And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!"
64813,"Have you given my idea any more thought? You said you'd let me know yesterday, and that obviously didn't happen."
64814,"Whatever you want. But let's go, now."
64815,"I want to make things clear. Markarth has its troubles, but there are no Forsworn in this city."
64816,I think my parents reserved a spot for me here at the College on the day I was born.
64819,That'll teach me to try and make extra coin around this city.
64823,Ready to get moving?
64825,"However, this hardly matters any longer as you appear to have exited unscathed."
64827,"So I've kept my mouth shut. Like I said, his family is better off believing he's gone, because he's never coming back."
64828,"Look, Ambarys, I just came here for a drink. I don't need any trouble."
64831,"Shameful, really. I blame the parents. "
64837,You want to talk to me? Okay.
64840,The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
64841,Hows about we figure out some way to keep warm tonight?
64842,I was adventuring in the depths of the ruins when I was attacked by a massive construct... like nothing I had ever seen.
64843,"It was anger that brought each of us here, but it is love that keeps us fighting."
64844,"Someone he could defeat that represented the Empire, the White-Gold Concordat, the banning of Talos worship."
64845,I have all sorts of interesting items for sale. Have you looked around?
64848,"Captain, I've been receiving complaints about this Giordano woman."
64853,Those milk drinkers? Might as well be elves. Think they're better than us.
64857,"I suppose. But Svari, we don't steal. We're better than that. Understand?"
64858,Wuunferth shall be apprehended. I thank you for your diligence in getting to the bottom of this matter.
64859,When Brynjolf brought you before me I could feel a sudden shift in the wind.
64863,"Mining is tough, but Mul says the money is good so we mine."
64866,"Someday, I hope we can get away from here... perhaps move back to Morrowind. This isn't at all what we expected."
64867,Please! I'm not sure I'll make it on my own.
64877,"Something wrong, Ahlam?"
64883,"Oh gods, you've taken everything I have. Just kill me and be done with it..."
64884,I... I... I don't know what to say. Such kindness is unheard of in these times.
64885,"You see, Pelagius' mother was... well... let us say ""unique."" Although, I suppose in the grand scheme of things, she was fairly average for a Septim."
64886,What's going on?
64887,Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore.
64891,Why did they do that? Why would they be so evil?
64895,Is this no longer so?
64896,A Stamina Potion maybe? Popular with young men.
64897,A close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us.
64900,(woof)
64901,It helped avert attention from our true nature.
64904,"Well, that's something at least."
64911,I'm sure my mother can compensate you for it.
64912,We want compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
64917,"Glad to hear it, Aia."
64918,I'm always glad to help a friend if I can. What do you need?
64922,"I dunno, sounds like I should try it."
64924,Looking to do some hunting? Avoid Brittleshin Pass. It's southeast of here.
64925,You're joking.
64927,"I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I thought you guaranteed discretion."
64930,"A word, my love?"
64934,"Yes, um.... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually."
64935,We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the world through our tongues and our blades.
64938,Go away!
64941,It may be worth attempting contact with Malacath after all.
64943, 
64947,What have we gotten ourselves into now?
64948,It's always encouraging to see the younger generations embracing education.
64949,Get him!
64950,Be careful men. There's bound to be more up ahead.
64952,"A few drinks, a few laughs and a contest. What could be better?"
64954,If we win. This war is going to drag on for years. I can feel it. We need to prepare for a long struggle ahead.
64957,Klo...Ul!
64967,"Been in the Guild a long time... joined right after Brynjolf. Not interested in leadership though, that's more his kind of thing."
64969,"Thank you! Thank you! I won't tell anyone what happened here, I swear it!"
64973,"And if not, may she drown in her own tears."
64977,Solitude is as glorious as they said it was. Nothing like Falkreath where I grew up.
64979,"I am, and I don't want to hear your moral judgments about it, either. I wouldn't have had to study in secret in the old days."
64980,"Then you've found your home, friend. Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. Welcome."
64981,"Your solo performance is about a week away. I expect to hear your early rendition tomorrow, understand?"
64982,Education is never appreciated until after the fact. Young people never understand this.
64984,Please! Help me get out of this cage. I don't know why those things locked me up and I don't want to wait around to find out.
64985,"Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally - you can see how painful that would have been for mother."
64990,You just going to stand there and take it? Fight back.
64991,"No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now."
64992,Thank you so much for taking care of those thieves. The Riverwood Trader is back to the way it used to be!
64994,"I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge."
64996,"If you run into any Stormcloaks, kill a dozen for me."
65001,Nothing like a good adventure or romance to lose yourself in.
65003,Falkreath is a hard place and tending a farm here is thankless work.
65004,"But it seems we both have needs, friend. Perhaps we can help each other out."
65006,No? You sure? 'Cause we're reaching the point of no return here...
65007,"So tell me, did Aringoth enjoy your visit?"
65012,"By the Hist, if I don't get something soon, I don't know how I'll get through the week."
65013,Have you lost your mind?
65014,"Never trade a sword for a hoe, my friend."
65015,"Hey, don't look at me that way! Who are you to judge me?"
65016,Now that's just rude.
65017,Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?
65019,"Excellent. With my brains and your brawn, that treasure will soon be mine... uh, ours."
65021,"When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In a sense, you become the Shout."
65023,Not hate. Distrust and fear. The Blades have always sought to turn the Dragonborn away from the path of wisdom.
65025,"Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. ""Ooh, you are such a pretty little girl. Would the sweetie like a sweetie? Oh yes, how about some chocolate?"""
65029,"Been lots of people coming and going through that creepy black door. And noises...  I'd say it sounds like construction, but that's crazy. Right?"
65030,"It fills me with joy to hear you're with child, Dinya. They said it wouldn't... that it couldn't happen, but Mara has shown them they're mistake."
65032,Zun!
65033,"Oh, thank the gods you're in Windhelm, Calixto!"
65034,I'm not accusing you of anything. Yet.
65037,"Destroy them quickly, and take out the archers in the towers along the way."
65039,Ha! I thought as much.
65040,"You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done."
65041,I've seen this before. We need some medicines to combat the ore dust. I was about to send a message to Windhelm for aid.
65042,Cross the bridge at your own peril!
65043,"And of course, don't forget to consult your Home Decorating Guide for descriptions of the decorations you can buy."
65046,You've caught me at a bad time. I've lost someone dear to me.
65047,We serve only the best here... Black-Briar Mead. May I get one for you?
65048,I just care about my husband so much and I hate to see him in this state.
65049,"Aye, I suspected as much but I've never been able to catch that little sneak with proof."
65050,These terms blatantly favor the rebels. Everyone here knows that.
65052,"If you're hungry, Marise sells fresh fish... caught by yours truly."
65053,"I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!"
65055,Not now.
65056,"Please, open the door. I need to get out of here."
65057,This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?
65058,"But really. A horker, some twine, three wood elves, and a hatchet? Points for creativity, if nothing else."
65060,I hear even the simple jobs are becoming difficult. It never used to be like this.
65061,Fight well.
65064,"Of course. But if you need me, just give the order."
65065,"Do you remember me now, Hjalti?"
65067,"You've been seen in the company of the Companions. That's an honorable path you're on, friend."
65069,What's the Jarl going to do about it?
65070,This is our only chance.
65071,"I'm in the mood to ssssiiiiinnnggg! What about you, friend? Care to join me?"
65072,I... am... eternal...
65074,I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.
65083,"He let Ulfric Stormcloak escape Solitude. Ulfric rides in, murders the High King and Roggvir lets him ride right back out."
65085,There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares.
65090,None of you will be alive to tell it.
65101,"Well, if you don't want to hear it, that's your loss."
65105,Nnnnooowwwwwww....
65112,Oh Saadia...
65115,"Pull the chain over there, and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all of the traps."
65116,He'd be insane to try. He doesn't have the men.
65120,Is this your tale of single-handedly fighting off a pack of trolls or my favorite... where you bedded four women on the same night?
65122,Olfrid sent ahead his compliments. Looks like his friend Arn is soon to be released thanks to his brand new identity.
65132,I'll be needing you to mop the place down extra tonight. Lots of spills!
65134,Ha! That's my girl.
65136,Keep it busy. I'll try to drain some of its power!
65137,"You there, please you have to help me! I was attacked by a vampire! Do you have a potion or something that can cure this before I turn?"
65138,"To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."
65140,"Well, that's not bad. But I was thinking ""Mogo's Mead"" really gets the place moving."
65145,"So, you're finally going to make Guild Master, eh? Well, you better track down Brynjolf to seal the deal."
65154,"Of course, mum."
65155,Never. This is the best the Guild's done since I've been a part of it.
65158,"Ever since my parents died and Haelga took me in, it's been a nightmare. How was I to know she was such a wretched woman?"
65160,Back... to... the Void...
65163, 
65169,You're going to regret this.
65172,"I had to use your pay to smooth things over with the client. They didn't want to be associated with a criminal. Next time, don't get arrested."
65191,"Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be very generously rewarded."
65196,What in the...?
65200,Which one is that?
65202,Saadia dear?
65207,"Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly rivaled our own."
65208,I'm fairly certain he was planning some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer language.
65210,"No? Well, if you think you're capable of it, then I'd be happy to provide it to you for a mere 30 gold."
65215,"Sing you a special song tonight, beautiful lass?"
65218,"By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers..."
65220,"Better than ever. With the Guild back on its feet, there's more coin to throw around. How about you?"
65221,I can't do this. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.
65231,Out of my way. The son of the Jarl has no time for idle conversation with travelers.
65233,"So, Thrynn, you were a bandit, huh?"
65234,How went your meeting with Ennodius Papius? Did you prove his paranoia legitimate?
65238,"I have a few very detailed missives from border patrols, beginning with Fifth Irregulars' reports on the movements of...."
65239,Need something?
65241,Runil has been a true friend to my wife and I in our time of need. 
65248,"I don't know how you made it this far, but you'll go no farther."
65252,Runil has been a true friend to my wife and I in our time of need. 
65253,"Yeah, what of it?"
65255,Not yet... wait until Brynjolf's finished the ceremony.
65257,"Look, I've been in this business a long time and I've seen all types. You can play it tough, you can play it smart... whatever."
65276,"Thank you, thank you. No, please, hold your applause."
65280,"So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!"
65281,I can smell your shame!
65285,I think my voice is ready. I hope we've done this well. 
65289,Halt. You're under arrest for murder and conspiracy against the city of Markarth!
65290,Go and see for yourself. Zu'u ni bo nol het. I will be here... unless Alduin returns before you do.
65291,"I tried to fence some goods to Tonilia, and you know what she told me?"
65292,I am loath to utter his name... one cannot erase a thing if it has a name to be remembered.
65293,Yeagh!
65297,"""His men dressed up and then went out to fight, but they reversed Olaf's orders much to Winterhold's sorrow."""
65298,She's watching over the others. Look alive now.
65301, 
65305,"But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said..."
65308,Brynjolf told me he was looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
65318,"I'm not sure what it's made from, but I can tell you that once you've had a taste, you'll never crave anything else."
65323,Death to the beastblood!
65327,"Shor as well - he welcomes all heroes to his kingly hall, if we could but reach it."
65329,So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?
65330,Come on! Do it again! Ha ha ha ha ha!
65331,"Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we are."
65335,You smell like dead cat. Can I assume Ma'randru-jo has been taken care of?

65347,"""death-dealing demon and dragon-killing King."""
65350,Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of my acquaintances. They're animals... they show absolutely no pity or remorse.
65353,"Die, you dog!"
65361,"Well, look what we have here."
65362,I can't stand this city. It's impossible to make a decent living here.
65367,I need you to put all your efforts into this job. We can't afford any mistakes.
65372,"How went your encounter with  Ma'randru-jo? Back in Hammerfell, I always loved watching two cats rip each other to shreds..."
65378,Bah. You're always working. Why else would I spend so much time here?
65379,Did you know Brynjolf was looking for you? I think it's about the Guild Master ceremony.
65383,"""Olaf gave orders, Winterhold disguises. An attack on Solitude total destruction to follow."""
65387,You still need to remove that blood stain. From the... incident.
65388,"Muiri? Muiri? So, what, you're the cow's champion? Oh, now that is rich. Well then, champion, let's get this over with."
65396,He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of academia... I was devastated when he was killed.
65399,It's too bad they executed Roggvir before we got here.
65405,"""In Solitude bards train for their service, they also gather each year and burn a King who deserves it.""  "
65407,Just leave me in peace.
65408,Hope you're willing to back those words up with your fists!
65410,"Dragonborn, even in death you dog my steps?"
65412,"Back from your little vacation in Falkreath. So, did you enjoy the sights, sample the food... kill the housecarl?"
65420,"Ah, back from Fort Graymoor. The old servant has been put out of her misery, I hope?"
65422,"""Olaf struck a deal to make himself king, Numinex let go though none tell that tale."""

65467,"Oh, yes, Miss Hulda."
65468,We've got an assassin! Check the shadows!

65477,Then pay with your blood.
65479,Ugh!

65485,"It seems that a predator has invaded their home, and someone needs to clear the beast out."

65507,"""Olaf grabbed power, by promise and threat;"" "
65509,Oh that is exciting! I'm sure the court and the Jarl will love it. I'm writing it in now.

65522,"""your cunning capture of Numinex, a con for the ages."""
65524,Is that the best the Listener can do?
65533,I heard what happened and the Guild owes you thanks for bringing this to light.

65541,"Thank you, Runil. Your support means much to us."
65545,"You know, things are really starting to move around here. I mean, look at the place. I've never seen so much merchandise."
65551,"Just a reminder, sweetie - the blankets still need to be washed."
65559,"We're running low on the Black-Briar mead. In a couple days I'll have you make a run, fetch some more."
65560,It's this place. It feels like home. It's just nice to finally have something going right in my life.
65565,"Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view."
65566,Coming... Mother...
65572,"If you find Mercer, give no quarter... kill him and be done with it."
65574,"Your mistake, Companion."
65582,The Silver Hand has been scouring the world for more pieces of Wuuthrad.
65584,"Good, you're here."
65585,"There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!"
65595,The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland.
65596,"With the passing of my dear husband Torygg, the weighty position of Jarl has fallen to me. Please direct questions to my Steward."
65607,"I return to you, Father."
65616,"So, the ending of my tale I began earlier..."
65618,I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment.
65621,The bitter war of the world beyond was all for naught.
65622,You looking to buy some potions? Or maybe I could help train you to make your own?
65625,"It's time to die, dog."
65630,Wish I could head inside Solitude myself. Wouldn't mind seeing Roggvir get what's coming to him.
65636,"And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!"
65638,"Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be moderately rewarded."
65639,"Yeah, it's really something else, isn't it?"
65643,Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. It should open the way. 
65645,The Silver Hand has been scouring the world for more pieces of Wuuthrad.
65647,I'm bleeding! Ha ha ha ha ha!
65651,"It's been quite a boon, looking like a child. No one ever suspects a thing."
65662,Good going... you got arrested. Now how do you think that looks for the Guild? Better luck next time.
65663,Or you can try your luck with one of the court wizards around Skyrim. They also sell spells.
65668,"And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!"
65670,"Before we begin, I want to make two things perfectly clear."
65675,You were ranting when you got here  but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.
65676,"Being connected to a criminal didn't make the client happy... next time, act like a real thief and don't get caught."
65680,"Well then, consider it done."
65682,Grraaagghh!
65684,"""Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!"""
65688,What are you doing? You're supposed to be attending the ceremony.
65694,You just better hope this one isn't another waste of my coin.
65695,How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that long? Amazing.
65696,My targets make the mistake of not perceiving me as a threat. Last mistake they ever make.
65702,"Hold a moment, Rune. What did you think about my idea?"
65705,"By gods' jest in this grim mist together snared, Stormcloak and Imperial, we wander hopeless, waiting for succor."
65709,Eyyaargh!
65721,Don't forget to polish those glasses later.
65738,I hope this deal goes through. I'm putting quite a bit of coin on the line... and the last two you set up fell through.
65739,"Your idea to start a brothel, right? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I think?"
65742,Let me make this plain and simple. No more jobs until you pay Vex. No get to it.
65747,"And so in death, too late, I learn the truth - fed by war, so waxed the power of Alduin, World-Eater - wisdom now useless."
65750,"Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him."
65752,You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take prisoners.
65762,"If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare hands!"
65771,Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish to see them avenged.
65785,"I don't understand it either. They were a sure thing, I swear."
65796,Here you are. Now I'm anxious to see you cast it.
65804,I hope Brynjolf chokes on his gold.
65818,Gods help us!
65830,I dare Mercer to come back here! He sets one foot in the cistern and I'll cut it off!
65840,No!
65857,Agh!
65861,Gaaaah!
65862,Killing you will make for an excellent story.
65865,Noooo!
65867,"Yes, well. After the unfortunate incident that occurred, I think it's best if we just move on."
65869,No new boots? Does this mean the Argonian is still alive?
65872,"If I wanted to hear a tall tale, I'll read a children's storybook. Get some better stories, Vipir."
65875,"""O, Olaf, our subjugator, the one-eyed betrayer;"""
65878,"At this rate, the Guild won't be such a laughingstock anymore."
65879,"Alright, alright... Um... How about ""The Guttersnipe""?"
65880,Got a shop owner with a very choice item a client wants to get his hands on if you do the dirty work.
65882,"So, what of the old beggar, Narfi? Is it done? Has he groveled for his last septim?"
65883,Take a look around. Have you ever laid eyes on such wealth?
65885,Couldn't be busier.
65886,Let's just hope it stays this way for a long time.
65887,So I'm finally seeing you with a smile on your face.
65890,Nothing seems to work!
65892,"Hmm... Yes, you do raise a good point. What about the ""Sweet Maidenfair from Hadleyshire""?"
65895,"It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies."
65896,"It doesn't matter. She wears that armor, she dies."
65897,"Things are quiet for the moment. That won't last long. As soon as a new campaign starts, I want you there. Stay close. See me tomorrow."
65898,We knew you'd be coming here.
65901,"So, Sapphire. Can I do anything for you, or more to the point... to you?"
65905,"Wait until the ceremony is over, then we'll talk."
65908,"Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be generously rewarded."
65910,"Guild Master, huh? Well, guess we could do worse. Better go see Brynjolf about it."
65913,You're an idiot.
65914,Here's to a long and prosperous future... may the Guild last another hundred years.
65915,We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.
65916,We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.
65917,"You hear the news? There's a dragon roosting up on Mount Anthor, to the northwest."
65920,"Hang on. When the ceremony's done, we'll talk."
65922,"""No shouting match between dragon and man, no fire or fury did this battle entail."""
65924,"As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you."
65926,Soon.
65927,"I never saw this coming, I thought we were just having a run of bad luck."
65928,You're just in time to say hello to Roggvir.
65929,What do you need?
65930,"On the plus side, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim."
65934,Hrongar carries on the policies of his brother and refuses to acknowledge the Legions right to garrison troops in his city.
65935,You've left me no choice...
65936,"Best head up to Dragonsreach, then, and see the Jarl. He's lord of Whiterun, and can set you on the path."
65939,"A thousand years from now Skyrim will have changed rulers dozens of times but the return of the dragons, that story is once in an era."
65940,If you want something a bard can dig into look to the dragons.
65944,Raarrgh!
65947,"Could you deliver the ashes to Runil, the priest of Arkay? He'll know the right blessings to make for Berit's soul."
65952,"""Because Solitude would not soon bend knee, Olaf would hurt them while his status accrued."""

65955,"""Olaf was Numinex in human form, on moonless nights he would spread wings and sail."""
65959,"You trying to scare off my customers, son? Lively! Keep it lively!"
65963,"So is it true, bandits get... you know, real friendly with the wildlife?"
65964,"We are all trapped in Alduin's web - for our allegiance he cares not, but devours us equally - doom unescapable."
65966,Have any skooma? I need to get something from Grisvar.
65975,"I think if Brynjolf catches wind of it, he'll boot you right out of here... so drop it already!"
65980,"Gettin' pinched and endin' up in jail doesn't cut it with our clients. If you want to get paid next time, stay clean."
65983,There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope you find him before he escapes our grasp.
65989,I hope he turns up soon... he needs to answer for his betrayal.
65990,"""But Solitude stood strong, Skyrim's truest protectors."""
66002,"""He sacked Winterhold in dragon form, and bent their minds to blame Solitude."""

66006,There is no pain in the Void!

66035,Oof!
66037,"""Olaf's vengeance was instant, inspired and wicked."""
66038,"Well, you see, the palace - Dragonsreach - was originally built to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name."

66095,"Oh yes, mum. I'll make sure it gets done."
66101,"One more song, what say you? Yeah? All right, then!"
66106,"An unfortunate natural disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched."
66123,"Well, I was thinking maybe something mournful. A High Elf dirge, perhaps? These are rather trying times, after all."
66142,You wish to kill me? Someone has already had that honor.
66143,"Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck."
66155,I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.
66175,"When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping."
66176,One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.
66180,"Ha! My opponent is so paralyzed with terror, no words will come. Let's be done with it, then!"
66184,I agree. It'll be nice to get back the respect we lost in the last few years.
66191,Ugh!
66194,"By order of the Jarl, stop right there!"
66200,I have to admit I didn't think it would actually be there.  Now let's take a look at this...
66204,"I'll rip you apart, Companion!"
66206,"By Sithis, I'll see you dead!"
66212,"You haven't faced that pirate captain yet, have you? Safia? I only ask because you're still alive..."
66215,The master has gone but Dervenin will find him. Dervenin should not have gone.
66220,How's the training going?
66221,"I faced him fearlessly - my fate inescapable, yet my honor is unstained - can Ulfric say the same?"
66225,Please tell me you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from his skin...
66230,"I see you're back from Dawnstar. Beitild lies dead, I hope?"
66252,You won't get that lucky again!
66254,Ysgramor would be ashamed of you!
66267,"We've been down this road before, Mikael. Save the sap and sadness for your lady friends. My patrons need life! Cheeriness!"
66269,Ow! Cheap shot!
66274,What? Nooo!
66276,"You're alive. Then I guess you haven't paid a visit to the vampire yet, hmm?"
66277,"Taken care of that layabout Deekus, yet? Or does the idea of killing a fellow Argonian make your scales crawl?"
66284,"Yes, you were going to demonstrate your ability, were you not?"
66287,We need to find out what Ancano's up to.
66291,"Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all been misled!"
66293,"Yes, mum?"
66298,"How come you here? The king of this realm will cast you out - cursed be your name by all sons of Skyrim, with scorn unceasing."
66300,"""Because Solitude would not soon bend knee, Olaf would hurt them while his status accrued."""
66301,I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray all of us like that?
66302,Punishment's too good for Mercer Frey. The only penalty for his betrayal is death.
66303,Whole dwarven city underneath the keep. Nchuand-Zel. Best steer clear if you don't want a Steam Centurion carving you up.
66304,The Falmer retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the dwarves who ended up betraying them.
66308,She said that she barely had enough coin to cover it and I should come back later. Can you imagine that?
66309,Only then will I take my rightful place as High Queen.
66312,"I think ""Seven Septims for Sigurd"" will do nicely. Especially when they're in their cups."
66317,There! Now attack it!

66474,"When you have completed your count of days, I may welcome you again, with glad friendship, and bid you join the blessed feasting."
66477,They will sing of this battle in Shor's hall forever. But your fate lies elsewhere.
66782,"To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war, our wills undaunted."

66893,But our oath as Blades binds us. Paarthurnax must die. There's no excuse now that Alduin is dead.

66897,Nahl...
66900,Daal...Vus!
66911,You know this one? I saw her training in the yard with Vilkas.
66921,Your crimes offend the Code of Malacath and we demand payment. Choose. Gold or blood.
66922,"By the Code of Malacath, you must pay bloodprice for your crimes. Which will it be, blood or gold?"
66924,"Stop, outlander! You must pay bloodprice for your crimes."
66930,Her heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
66931,Alduin's mist is more than a snare - its shadowy gloom is his shield and cloak.
66936,"You freed Svaknir, a fool of a poet, but an honest enemy who has earned my respect."
66937,"My disciples still follow the difficult path - the Way of the Voice is neither wide, nor easy."
66940,"Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here."
66950,The Emperor's cousin is dead! This is a disaster!
66951,Oof!

66968,"The mist is gone, my mind is clear."
66970,"Shor's power protects this hall; but beyond is fear, brought by Alduin."
66972,"By Shor's command we curb our wrath, so we feast and sing, til the final doom."
66973,"Take your ease, let troubles fade."
66975,"A cup, Dragonborn, to death and glory!"

66994,No problem! How can I help?
66996,Nyyarrggh!
67006,"With both Alduin and Paarthurnax dead, a dark chapter in history will finally be closed."
67007,"In life we were enemies, but eternity's too long to hold a grudge - my heart's now free of such old hatreds."
67008,I hear your heart beat like the Harbingers of old. Your glories in Skyrim are seen and honored.
67013,Argh!
67015,Rrarggh!
67017,"I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned."
67029,"Far you've travelled, your trials long, to taste of Sovngarde's sweet delights."
67062,"Come, let us share a cup of mead, and trade tales of our time on Mundus, reliving the glory of our remembered deeds."
67063,"Today you die, your doom has come."
67065,Wait. You there. Step forward.
67072,By Ysmir! Nothing kills it!
67095,"Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can."
67102,"Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor."
67115,Gods above... that's better news than I had hoped!
67118,"Before I fall, you'll feel the bite of my sharp blade, as Shor's my witness."
67159,Ugh. You mangy piece of pit-bait.
67176,Agh!
67208,"You from Daggerfall, Breton? Fleeing from some court intrigue?"
67216,"Well fought, friend. Your fury is unmatched."
67233,"You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons."
67244,"Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Wait... I remember you. So the old man thinks you've got some heart, I guess."
67262,There must be something about that amulet. Have you tried putting it on?

67347,But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part.
67352,We need to get moving! That dragon is tearing up the whole keep!
67367,"Ease your heart, our honor is unstained - it's by Shor's command we curb our onslaught."
67376,"Please, enjoy the festivities! This is a day of peace and happiness, when Imperials and Stormcloaks join together, as equals!"
67400,"Fall, damn you, fall!"
67401,"Well, at least you didn't do anything stupid. Next time, when you're given a job, don't wander off or take your sweet time."
67412,"Or will you merely fade from history, unremembered?"
67418,"My blade is restless, unblooded too long."
67420,"Let the Way of the Voice be your guide, and the path of wisdom will be clear to you. Breath and focus, Dragonborn. Your future lies before you."
67425,"You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit? Your kind always seems to find trouble."
67431,"New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me."
67439,A cup I'll gladly raise in company with you. None have yet bested me in boasting or drinking.
67473,"No, I'm not a rebel. You can't do this!"
67482,"Immensely powerful mage, back in the First Era. Had an understanding of magic few have ever matched."
67491,"At last. It is over. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end."
67515,"Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like normal mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind."
67525,"You're not with the Thalmor Embassy, are you high elf? No, that can't be right...."
67531,"Hero of the Nords I name you, Dragonborn, let none deny it."
67560,Zu'u lost daal.
67564,Muiri? I can't believe my family trusted that backstabbing little strumpet. You tell her she's dead to us. You hear me? Dead!
67573,"But with four Voices joined, our valor combined, we can blast the mist and bring him to battle."
67581,"Thank you. Thank you, Dragonborn. You've done a great service for us all."
67586,"At Sovngarde's gates I'll meet my fate with mirthful heart, and know I fell in noblest cause."
67587,"Zu'u Alduin, zok sahrot do naan ko Lein."
67593,I have nothing to say to you. Just... leave me alone.
67600,What do you need?
67625,"Submit and pay bloodprice, criminal."
67627,"Since you're still alive, I assume you have good news to report?"
67641,I'm afraid she's right. I'm deeply sorry that this has to come between us.
67661,"You are persistent, Dovahkiin. Pruzah ol aar. A fine slave you would have made."
67667,"Down with you, damned worm!"
67668,Hear that? Stormcloaks. Maybe we can reason with them.
67669,It's a werewolf! To arms! To arms!
67681,"Use Dragonrend, brothers! Bring him to swords-reach!"
67685,Kel drey ni viik.
67691,"Let us not spurn our lord's bounty - this hall is his gift, for glory well-earned."
67707,"Seek ye food or song unending? Fighting, drinking, fellowship and boasting? Find welcome here, and warm your soul."
67709,"Listen well, friend, and lighten your mood while words I'll spin of warriors bold, whose deeds of valor brought undying fame."
67712,(bark)
67716,(woof)
67718,(bark)
67721,(woof)
67730,"Don't delay, Shield-Sister."
67731,"Don't delay, Shield-Brother."
67732,I can see it in your eyes - you've seen the land of the gods and returned.
67739,These Imperials have potions in here. We're going to need them.
67741,"As a matter of fact, there are. Have you ever heard of Shalidor?"
67747,"Now ends this tale, my eternity be damned!"
67749,"I've heard whispers of more of his work having turned up. If you can track it down, it may prove useful to all of us."
67751,I'll start translating it. Shouldn't take me more than a day or two.
67754,Excellent!
67762,Orders are to wait until General Tullius arrives.
67769,I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon! We need to fall back!
67770,Just give the General some time!
67771,What are you doing? We need to get out of Helgen. Now!
67772,Grab everything important and let's move! Dragon's burning everything to the ground!
67778,I just need to gather some more potions.
67782,Over here!
67789,Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted? I had to let the whole plan fall through.
67796,"Fate drives you, but you follow your own path. Choose wisely, lest you wander into evil."
67797,Keep your eyes on it!
67799,Ralof of Riverwood.
67805,Step towards the block when we call your name. One at a time.
67806,Empire loves their damn lists.
67807,"For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with."
67811,"My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?"
67812,"Face your death with some courage, thief."
67825,What? Did... you need something?
67829,Daar Lein los dii.
67832,"What kind of cruel, horrible person are you? My sister was murdered. Do you have any idea what that's like? What I'm going through?"
67841,Does this mean... is it done? Is Alduin truly defeated?
67844,"Then it is done at last. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end."
67856,Or will your name be a curse to future generations?
67860,Now it is up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill.
67864,Please... Delphine has been very worried about you.
67871,"We are all in your debt, Dragonborn."
67872,"When you walked into my inn that day, I never imagined where it would all lead... dragons out of legend... Sovngarde..."
67876,"I knew you could do it... I believed in you, and yet... I still didn't think I'd live to see this day."
67880,"But just as Paarthurnax's later deeds do not expiate his crimes, your deeds do not allow us to ignore our duty."
67881,"You what? How could you run out? J'zargo gave you more than enough. Bah, just forget J'zargo ever asked for your help."
67885, 
67887,"I crave a tale of tall ships and fearless heroes, for heart's ease."
67890,"Hail, comrade! Shall we by clash of steel ease the gloom of the encompassing mist?"
67891,Meat and mead must ever make way for the clash of steel - the song of battle.
67893,"By a bold stroke, you bested me, friend."
67894,"Shor's favor found me today. Let's lift a mug of mead together, our wounds to salve and weariness cure."
67896,With mead and fellowship let's mend our wounds.
67899,"Are you a relative of one of the Riften dock workers, Argonian?"
67904,You're a long way from the Imperial City. What're you doing in Skyrim?
67907,"You from one of the strongholds, Orc? How did you end up here?"
67909,"What're you doing here, Redguard? You a sellsword? A sailor from Stros M'kai? "
67912,Just give me a minute... I'm out of breath...
67913,Werewolf!
67916,Shall Alduin remain so long unchallenged?
67918,I long to fight that foul worm.
67919,Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim.
67926,You've done it... just as the prophecy said...
67930,Zu'u unslaad! Zu'u nis oblaan!
67937,"Dovahkiin, hin kah fen kos bonaar."
67940,"Better to die with blade in hand than feed his hunger, hopeless in the mist."
67944,Shor's high seat stands empty; his mien is too bright for mortal eyes.
67948,"Gormlaith the fearless, glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the valiant, heavy-handed warrior; Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim."
67957,"Felldir speaks wisdom - the World-Eater, coward, fears you, Dragonborn."
67959,"We must drive away his mist, Shouting together, and then unsheathe our blades in desperate battle with our black-winged foe."
67962,"If it is our lot to end, we'll live in song if not in soul."
67967,By the gods! It... it can't be!
67982,"But if they've captured you.... Oh gods, where are they taking us?"
67986,I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.
67987,This way! Come on!
67989,I can make all your problems with the guards go away. But it'll cost you. What do you say?
67993,"All right, all right. Just keep your voice down and don't let me catch you again."
67994,"Since you put it that way, I think we can overlook your crime for now."
67995,Pruzah wundunne wah Wuth Gein. I wish the old one luck in his... quest.
67996,There's still the matter of Paarthurnax. I'm not ungrateful for what you've done. Esbern speaks for both of us.
67997,"Sadly, he's now lost in the soul-snaring mist - defeat Alduin, and his doom avert - I hope to greet him in this Hall as a friend."
67998,But if you stray from wisdom then to Sovngarde you will not return.
68000,"The endless wait gives way to battle! Alduin's doom, his death or ours!"
68001,The three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
68005,Great! Let's go!
68007,"Well, it's been fun. I guess I'll head back to Rorikstead."
68009,"Face me, then! Zu'u Alduin!"
68015, 
68017,I have already defeated your friends once. Beyn. I do not fear them.
68023,"Dovahkiin, you should not have come here. Nu hin sil dii."
68024,"Zu'u lost kriaan hi ont, nu hin sille fen nahkip suleyki."
68025,"No higher fate than fall in battle at Sovngarde's gates, a glorious end!"
68027,Nust wo ni qiilaan fen kos duaan.
68034,Hin sil fen nahkip bahloki.
68035,Di kiirre fen alok.
68040,Fen du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
68041, 
68043,It was the Empire killed her! I know it! They killed her so they can blame it on the Stormcloaks!
68094,His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu - our father Akatosh.
68116,I'll be right here. Be careful now!
68144,Anyone else feel like running?
68147,"There are no jails in an Orc Stronghold, criminal. You must pay in gold or blood."
68204,"Through fire and time, the terror has lived. No more, I say! I've set my heart on terrible deeds, death's grim art."
68207,Where in Oblivion are we supposed to go? Where's the way out?
68254,But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
68284,"You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman."
68293,Grrargh!
68307,Will you be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages?
68313,"You just going to stand there, gawking? Go away. You're starting to... frighten me."
68329,Everything here appears to be in order. You can move along now.
68345,"Stand fast! The fell worm's death is ours at last, the light returns!"
68355,Use everything we have!
68442,It is by Shor's command that we curb our wrath - so let's feast and sing 'til our fate calls us.
68447,"That's a little... showy, even for you."
68486,"My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!"
68505,We heard the news from Whiterun - that you left the city on the back of a dragon!
68516,Just give me a minute. Let me think.
68532,By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and ventured not the vale's dark mist.
68548,What in the Eight Divines is this thing?
68597,Aye. Let us forget our sorrow in the fury of battle.
68651,For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!
68654,"Another refugee? Gods really have abandoned your people, dark elf."
68659,I hope you will return to us soon with the news that justice has finally been done.
68685,"Come on, I haven't got all morning."
68720,"He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible."
68723,It's still coming!
68734,"No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening."
68745,Grab Gunjar's gear. No shame in borrowing a friend's axe.
68746,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock.
68771,We have to keep moving.
68772,You're not going to kill me!
68787,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Cyrodiil.
68789,There's a way out through here!
68791,"You have quite the bounty on your head in Falkreath. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
68792,Gunjar isn't coming back from the dead. Take his armor and anything else on him.
68817,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to the Summerset Isle.
68818,This way. Come on!
68826,"General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!"
68827,And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.
68834,Stop right there. 
68846,That armor on Gunjar isn't doing him any good. Go ahead. Take it.
68847,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Morrowind.
68854,"You have quite the bounty on your head in Winterhold. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
68858,"You have quite the bounty on your head in Eastmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
68876,Get these prisoners out of the carts. Move it!
68882,"You have quite the bounty on your head in The Rift. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
68890,"I'm sorry. At least you'll die here, in your homeland."
68926,"You have quite the bounty on your head in Whiterun. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
68942,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Elsweyr.
68951,Forget the list. She goes to the block.
68962,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Orsinium.
68993,"You have quite the bounty on your head in The Reach. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
69002,See if one of these chests has some armor for you.
69003,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Black Marsh.
69005,"Okay, great!"
69022, 
69025, 
69026,It's very unfortunate that you've been suspended.
69027,You better get some gear.
69028,Now I'm finally going to have some fun around here.
69030,"People think they can run away from their crimes, but I will always catch up with them and make them pay. "
69031,I have no more business with you.
69034,"You have quite the bounty on your head in Haafingar. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
69039,"You have quite the bounty on your head in The Pale. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
69049,"I will make sure this gets back to the Jarl. Minus my cut, of course. Consider your name cleared, for now. "
69050,Then you are worth more to me dead!
69052,We have to keep moving.
69053,There's a way out through here!
69054,This way. Come on!
69058,Archers!
69062,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Hammerfell.
69064,Captain. What should we do? She's not on the list.
69067,"By the way, if you're looking for something to do..."
69083,"By your orders, Captain."
69085,Got to be a sword or two in one of these chests. Look around.
69098,"You have quite the bounty on your head in Hjaalmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. "
69104,Bye!
69108,I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Valenwood.
69127,How dare you!
69145,"Come on now, fight your own battles."
69154,"Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin, butchered at her own wedding! Well done!"
69157,"Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet authentic?"
69166,That the best the Legion has? Heh.
69181,And now Titus Mede II is as good as dead.
69198,See you in Sovngarde.
69201,Over here!
69212,Don't need to pay me no mind. I'm the least important person in here.
69213,That's how the Legion fights.
69216,The prisoners are escaping!
69218,Imperial dogs!
69245,"If you are, then you talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly."
69295,So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet.
69301,I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
69302,I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
69307, 
69309,Death to the Empire!
69312,For Ulfric and Skyrim!
69315,Stormcloaks! Filthy traitors!
69319,You won't leave Helgen alive!
69320,Don't fall behind!
69322,"This way, come on!"
69323,We better keep going.
69325,Let's see his eminence try to ignore this.
69327,Follow me.
69331,"Come on, this way."
69337,"You! You're responsible for the siege of that... city! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!"
69342,"You! You're responsible for the siege of Solitude! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!"
69356,"And by ""supplies"" I suppose you mean weapons and armor."
69357,"It's my mill. Some folks think it's my town too, but it ain't. The Jarl in Whiterun owns the land and the town. I just pay the taxes."
69358,"Another day, another victory."
69361,That's how a true Nord fights.
69369,Victory... for now.
69370,That the best Ulfric has?
69375,I'll stay here and wait for General Tullius. Good luck you two.
69376,"Keepin' the palace clean an' the lords fed ain't easy work, but it's honest work."
69381,I do the cookin' and cleanin' round the palace.
69408,Let's go.
69415,Stormcloaks!
69450,Ever onward.
69457,I'll stay here and wait for General Tullius. Good luck you two.
69467,"Okay lass, ready to make some coin?"
69514,Looks like the way out's up ahead. Come on.
69533,Alvor can help you out. He's our blacksmith.
69544,"Okay lad, ready to make some coin?"
69547,Freedom or Sovngarde!
69548,Let's keep moving.
69581, 
69585,"Ah, but there has not been a Listener in years and years. Our Lady has not chosen Cicero, and certainly not Astrid. Or... anyone. But some day..."
69590,"I've seen a puzzle like this before... there's got to be another lever to pull, but you'd better hurry. A septim says this mechanism's on a timer."
69596,"Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted."
69601,"If you're serious, you're in the right place. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. Here you'll find General Tullius, commanding our forces in Skyrim."
69626,Hold your head up. I'm sure it won't happen again.
69638,"Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess."
69651,"Think you've got the mettle, eh?"
69661,The only possible help I've come across are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?
69666,I should've finished you when I had the chance!
69667,Karliah's taught you nothing! Your lessons begin anew!
69671,You already appear to have someone with you.
69673,Get the damn Key and let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
69676,"Come, ""Nightingale!"" Find me if you can!"
69678,Very well.
69680,I've mastered the shadows... and now your life is mine!
69684,You can't kill what you can't see!
69687,Someone get the battlemages out here. Now!
69689,Hmm. The gate below still looks closed.
69690,Did you need something?
69694,A word of advice. Don't disappoint me.
69703,"Ha! Why you are, silly! You are the Listener! You are the Listener! Such a kidder..."
69712,"Of course our Lady is dead, so she doesn't talk with words, since her lips are... rotted. But inside the Listener's head. I hear it's... intimate."
69714,"Oh, well, the Listener is the only person the Night Mother speaks to. It is the highest honor attainable by a member of the Dark Brotherhood."
69716,Now that's just sad. Come back when you actually have something to show for your thieving.
69723,"No problem, I'll handle it."
69724,Be careful around here. You don't want to anger the wrong person.
69725,"We may be rough, but we don't tolerate thieving around here. If that's your game, go join the lowlives in Riften."
69726,"I'm sorry, that can't be done."
69742,"Guards, get the townspeople to safety!"
69747,I'm right behind you.
69748,"There is an empty home in the city, but there was some... unpleasantness recently. I'm afraid it's not available just yet."
69750,"This better be important, I'm quite busy."
69751,Don't you have better things to do than disturb me?
69753,Anything else before you go?
69758,The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?
69759,You must realize what a great honor this is. For the Night Mother to have chosen you... I am just in awe. You have Cicero's utmost confidence!
69763,I'm watching you.
69784,"I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do something like that. Even for you."
69801,Right.
69820,But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.
69852,Now you suffer!
69860,Nothing after all.
69863,"Unfortunately, thanks to some problems they've been having, it hasn't seen much use lately."
69864,Hunh!
69873,Nnyyyaarrgghh!
69874,Yah!
69879,"There you are. Look, I... I just wanted to say thanks for coming to find me. Back in Dawnstar. Crazy jester finally met his match, am I right?"
69887,"Either way, it's off limits to you."
69897,This is the East Empire Company's central warehouse. All of their shipments go through here.
69899,No match at all.
69903,You cannot escape me!
69906,Nargh!
69915,I honor my lord by destroying you!
69916,"If you want to help, I suppose you could head to Windhelm and talk to Orthus Endario. He's in charge over there."
69918,No one escapes!
69924,It cannot... end like this...
69929,"You return, foolish mortal?"
69931,Gah!
69936,The warehouse is off-limits. I suggest you head back the way you came.
69943,Agh!
69951,"You meet your end, mortal."
69954,This is the East Empire Company's central warehouse. All of their shipments go through here.
69957,How should I know? I don't work for them.
69961,Hyargh!
69962,Yearrgh!
69968,Are you prepared for your death?
69972,Gah!
69975,"You are weak, mortal."
69980,Nargh!
69983,Another who seeks death.
69988,Nnh!
69989,I will feast on your heart.
69995,Gah...
70007,The warehouse is for East Empire Company workers only. Entering without permission is a crime.
70020,A challenger is near...
70027,"Either way, it's off limits to you."
70045,"There you are, weakling!"
70047,There could be no other end.
70057,Aggh...
70060,"There's nothing for you in the warehouse, so why don't you take a walk?"
70062,No... not by a mortal...
70077,Quiet again.
70079,Hiding will not save you now.
70081,"And now that they've solved their little pirate problem, they're busier than ever."
70083,I smell weakness...
70085,Unf!
70086,Agh...
70088,Hhyyaarargghhhh!
70089,Rrrraaaaarrggghhhh!
70090,Oof!
70092,Yeagh!
70093,Rargh!
70097,Ugh...
70100,"They say that Karliah murdered Gallus, but I'm not so sure."
70102,You'll never reach the Emperor! Not while I'm standing!
70113,I'm glad you were willing to trust me. I know it probably wasn't the best way to introduce myself. But old habits... you know.
70117,"Well, well. Looks like one of the Dark Brotherhood rats escaped its burning nest. I can fix that."
70119,"You'll never leave this ship alive, cutthroat!"
70125,What in blazes is going on? Are you working with Karliah?
70129,"And... good work. The next time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be helpful."
70132,"All that effort, and you just kill her. You've ruined everything."
70134,How many of those corpses lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend? What about their families?
70139,"Skyrim needs a High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will do the same."
70151,"Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now."
70153,Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.
70157,Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.
70158,Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for bringing Karliah here.
70161,"You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos, and now the Empire is going to put you down, and restore the peace."
70162,Better to stick together. I don't want you to get yourself killed before we even get there.
70165,"I hope you're Dragonborn, I really do. But we'll find out soon enough."
70169,"This is notorious bandit hideout. But it's also the shortest way to Kynesgrove, so... we may have to kill a few bandits."
70181,This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. Let's see if we can find that dragon mound.
70192,"Run, you idiot!"
70199,Look at that dark elf whore... strutting around like she's innocent. I'll cut her open from gullet to groin!
70225,I don't have time for this.
70226,"We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief."
70231,"To arms, brothers! It's the assassin!"
70232,They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.
70237,"Hey, you. You're finally awake."
70258,"If you don't have a good reason to be partnered with Karliah, you're dead."
70261,You want the Emperor? You'll have to get through us!
70263,You will bleed!
70265,Fall before me!
70275,"What? Do you want to be that thing's next meal? Into the keep, already!"
70276,To the keep! Move!
70277,Keep a sharp lookout. We can't afford any delays.
70281,We'd better keep moving.
70284,"Remember, we're not looking for trouble. We need to get to Kynesgrove as fast as we can."
70285,"I doubt the Thalmor are aware of you yet. So we should be safe from them, at least."
70287,"We may both end up dead, but at least it gets me out of Riverwood. I don't really think I'm cut out for the quiet life."
70288,Not too much farther now. Kynesgrove is just down the road to the southeast of here.
70289,We'll meet up near Karthspire.
70293,Lead on to Sky Haven Temple.
70296,Rrarggh!
70298,This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. The innkeeper ought to be able to tell us if there's any dragon mound nearby.
70301,(muffled grunts)
70309,Should have picked somebody else for your dinner.
70311,"You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there."
70314,You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
70316,"Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me."
70319,The Dark Brotherhood is dead... and so are you!
70322,Grrragh!
70324,Oblivion take you!
70325,"This looks promising. Akaviri stonework, I think. Reminds me a bit of Cloud Ruler Temple."
70326,If that's the way you want it.
70328,Watch out. Wolves.
70330,Where do they keep coming from?
70331,The roads just aren't safe these days.
70332,Let's keep moving.
70336,"There's an inn at Kynesgrove - the Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping Giant, of course."
70340,Has Tolfdir been telling stories again? I thought I made it quite clear that this was a subject inappropriate for conversation.
70341,So it's true. You've turned traitor. I can't believe it.
70342,Alduin isn't getting any weaker while we stand around here gawping at the architecture.
70344,Let's get this door open and see what we've got.
70347,No need to bother with giants right now. Just keep your distance.
70348,I think we're getting close. Let's keep moving.
70349,And... here. I suppose you've earned these.
70352,I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our noses.
70353,"You hear the news? The Emperor has been murdered! Right here, in Skyrim. By the gods, if the Dark Brotherhood can do that, nobody's safe..."
70354,Please don't allow him to continue to discuss the subject.
70356,This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use to you now.
70365,How dare you bring that Dunmer bitch here.
70372,"It all ends here, assassin!"
70377,Be careful. The Forsworn are just as dangerous as they look.
70401,"If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell."
70419,"Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?"
70423,"I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know. You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well done."
70434,We'll cross to the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then we can swing south to Kynesgrove.
70443,"Well, it's been described as an accident. I can't imagine it was intentional."
70445,"We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's visiting! The goddamned Emperor!"
70454,"I don't know. It's like a ward, but who's casting it? Ancano? How?"
70455,"And, as much as I'd like to kill the man myself, we can't risk an all out war with the Empire. We'll bide our time for now..."
70459,"Do you remember what I first told you, about how not being able to control magic could destroy you?"
70461,Let's get going.
70464,"Come on, soldier. Keep moving!"
70467,"I've never felt it appropriate to ask him about it, about how that must feel. Or, I suppose, if he can feel at all."
70474,"That's the end of that, hmm?"
70478,A shame it had to come to that.
70481,"You will die in terror, knowing your final fate..."
70488,"Beyond asking for you, he never said. Very strange indeed."
70505,We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's cousin is getting married! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
70518,Seems I still remember my old training.
70527,I'm getting too old for this.
70532,"Something must've gone wrong, and he ended up in the state he's in now, fused to the energies that flow through the College."
70535,It's locked. See if you can get it open with some picks. We might need that gold once we get out.
70539,You're too kind. Thank you. Be careful and stay safe.
70543,"A monk from the Psijic Order, here, after all these years, and then he just leaves."
70544,I'm... I'm not sure what happened.
70546,So that's why you were in the cart. Thieving.
70550,I hope we didn't offend him somehow.
70551,"You better get that armor on. Give that sword a few swings, too."
70553,Grab anything useful and let's go.
70555,There's no time to waste. Let's go.
70557,"All right, get that armor on and give that axe a few swings."
70560,That's how it's done.
70561,Hyah!
70568,"We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's cousin is getting married! "
70569,I didn't simply mean it could kill you. The Augur's accident is another very real type of a life destroyed.
70570,"There are dragons about, traveler. Be warned."
70572,"He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before."
70575,"Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind..."
70582,We lost everything.
70586,Murder! Murder!
70590,"But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident."
70593,"Sure, take all my things. Please."
70602,We'd better keep moving.
70608,But first... dir ko maar.
70611,Know that Gormlaith sent you down to death!
70612,Let's see here....
70613,"If royal blood was spilt, all of Cyrodiil would be up in arms. We can't afford an all out war with the Empire. So we'll bide our time for now."
70614,"It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else."
70616,That seems to be all of them.
70620,Another one for the Blades.
70621,I was just getting warmed up.
70634,"Thank you, traveler. Be safe and don't forget to keep an eye on the sky."
70636,We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's visiting! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
70638,I can always use the practice.
70642,Come on. We've got to get to Kynesgrove.
70651,That takes care of that.
70657,"By the gods, did that really just happen?!"
70662,"Help! Somebody, help!"
70684,My patron appears once more. Have you need of my blade?
70686,You're looking hale and healthy. It's good to see you again.
70692,Get out of my face. 
70696,"I could really use some more experience in the field. I'd be happy to join you again, and it won't cost a thing."
70698,"You have talent. Keep working at your craft, and you'll be a fine smith one day."
70704,"Ah, good. A lot of weapons and armor need leather for straps, fittings, that kind of thing."
70710,Let's see if you can make a hide helmet. Here's the rest of what you need.
70713,Let's improve the fit. Take this leather to the workbench over there.
70715,Didn't think I'd be seeing you again so soon.
70723,"You got what you came for, didn't you? Go then, back to your college."
70729,Now I have some time to kill...
70732,"If you need some skulls crushed, I'm still available for hire."
70744,Lead the way.
70748,"A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know."
70750,"Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise."
70760,Once more into danger!
70771,"Why don't you keep that dagger and helmet? Maybe you'll remember me when you're making Skyforge Steel, huh?"
70773,"Gods, you're boring!"
70779,"A storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving."
70786,"Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?"
70791,"It pleases me to see you again, my patron."
70795,"Back for more? Since we had so much fun the last time, I'll join you free of charge."
70798,"If you still need my blade, I'll join you. I want to make sure you get your money's worth."
70802,"Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise."
70803,"It's good to see you. If you need my help again, it's the same fee as always."
70804,I think we're done here.
70807,"I knew you couldn't stay away. Admit it, you were lost without me."
70808,Just make sure to take care of whatever's going on there. It's my name on the line.
70809,Who said anything about trouble? Now get out of my face.
70822,"Well, look who it is. Been keeping out of trouble much? I hope not!"
70825,"Well, look what the horker dragged in. Still wandering all over Skyrim and causing trouble?"
70829,"Not bad, but it's a little dull. How about you sharpen it up? Just need a bit of metal and the grindstone over there."
70836,"Since you paid my fee recently, I suppose it's only fair that I join you once more."
70857,I should hire you to be my assistant at this rate.
70874,I'm bored. What do you say we go smash a few heads in? This one's on me.
70882,There's been word of some trouble nearby. I'm on my way to investigate.
70886,I'm ready to go!
70901,"This looks good. You put time into your blades, they'll serve you well when you need them."
70920,"Yes, actually. How about you smith me an iron dagger? Here's everything you need to make one. Go ahead."
70929,"Of course, I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin."
70934,"Well met, friend. It's good to see you're still in one piece, with all the trouble you get into."
70938,You want to pay me to do my job? Fine. I'll mark the location on your map.
70943,You want to keep helping? How about you make some armor? Let's start by tanning some leather on the rack.
70944,I'll mark it on your map. This one's on you. 
70946,"We have plenty of ingredients for sale, too."
70948,"I probably shouldn't tell everyone who asks. This is important business, you know."
70954,"No, I think I've got this one. Thanks, though. "
70956,"If you really want to do my job for me... Here, I'll mark the location on your map."
70957,"Someone's going to get hurt, all right. "
70961, 
70962,"Why? What are you gonna do, cry?"
70963,What's a milk drinker like you doing out here? Go home to your mother.
70966,Let's get out of here.
70968,"Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment."
70970,"Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too."
70979,"All right, all right! No need to get violent. We're on the same side."
70997,"Long as you clean up. You know how to use it right? Mix a couple of ingredients together, see what happens."
71001,"Good, I can use the exercise. Haha!"
71002,My blade is yours once more.
71005,It's great to see you again! It's been too quiet without you around.
71024,"Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary."
71027,"An old storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving."
71030, 
71031,"Alright, then. Let's go."
71033,"You've been a worthy patron. Shall I join you once more, free of charge?"
71037,You're back! Great! Are we going on another adventure?
71040,"Okie dokie, Listener."
71041,Those binds aren't going to cut themselves.
71044,"Does it involve sneaking and stabbing? Ooh, please say yes!"
71045,I'd stay away if I were you.
71048,Do you have any orders?
71049,"Next, the dark elf!"
71051,You want me to do something or not?
71055,I love it when a plan comes together.
71059,All right.
71061,I suppose it would be. Good thinking.
71062,"I also know that no one really believes that. I've been trying to avoid him, honestly."
71066,"Any Nord can learn the Way of the Voice by studying with the Greybeards, given enough ambition and dedication."
71069,Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.
71076,Just name it.
71077,"By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!"
71080,Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.
71084,"Preposterous, and just the sort of thing I would expect from mages who have nothing better to do with their time."
71085,"Either way this ends up, I'm headed to the inn."
71087,"He's asked far, far too many questions about my research."
71090,Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?
71095,"Come on, you need your hands free."
71096,It's the End Times! The End Times have come!
71097,"Greetings, brother. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested."
71099,It's tradition. We mark the animal as a way to let the giants know we're giving it to them willingly. Sort of a peace offering.
71102,"Oh yes, Listener!"
71103,Thank you for your kindness.
71106,What's happening?
71110,I have everything under control. Thanks for offering.
71117,Important deliveries to make! No time for chatting!
71118,"I haven't told him anything, of course. What I'm doing is far too important. Can't breathe a word of it."
71123,"Something was discovered in Saarthal that was significant enough that Tolfdir sent a new member of the College, alone, to deliver word."
71124,"Now wait a minute, Listener. Even Cicero has his limits! Not many, mind you... but I do have them..."
71125,Don't trust that one. He's up to something.
71129,"Next, the Breton!"
71130,This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. 
71136,Move! Move!
71140,"Well done, well done indeed!"
71141,What does it take to kill this monster?
71144,No. I was too afraid to look. I don't know what we're going to do now. We have nothing left.
71148,"The cow, of course. Others do it differently, but I've found that an annual offering usually keeps the giants away from our livestock."
71150,This projection should be lit up like the night sky...
71157,I'm headed to the inn.
71159,But Listener... Are you sure? I just can't bring myself to do it...
71160,"Next, the renegade from Cyrodiil!"
71162,With pleasure.
71166,Give them their last rites.
71170,"I know he's from the Thalmor, and that he claims to be here simply as an advisor."
71171,"Lead with those arrows, dammit!"
71174,As you will.
71176,How does it move so damn fast?
71178,"Up through the tower, let's go!"
71184,"Come on, you need your hands free."
71191,"Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this ""advisor"" position he has is a sham, an excuse."
71192,"Here, consider these yours. And the Arch-Mage's quarters as well. I shall be here for advice, should you need me."
71194,"Not entirely true, though not entirely false either."
71196,How in Oblivion do we kill this thing?
71199,"Nice doing business with you, friend. "
71200,As you wish.
71205,Go!
71206,"It won't die, it just keeps coming!"
71209,"With pleasure, my Listener!"
71223,I just wanted to let you know that Ancano's been asking about you. I think he's looking for you.
71225,Keep your distance and you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
71226,Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your Stormcloak colors?
71228,"Next, the Redguard!"
71229,And speak to Eorlund if you want a better weapon than... whatever that is.
71230,"Anything you need, Listener."
71231,Sovngarde awaits!
71232,Of course. Right away.
71234,You there. I have questions for you.
71237,Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
71238,No need to get so... hostile. Just take it. Sounds like you need it more than I do.
71245,That everything?
71246,"Funny, when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe."
71254,Talos smite you!
71260,"Tolfdir is still there now, is he? I shall expect a full report when he returns."
71264,I want every arrow in the sky!
71265,I know I don't like the way he looks at me.
71268,A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.
71272,"I am well aware. Tolfdir is still in Saarthal, is he? I shall be expecting a full report from him when he returns."
71277,Why do you care?
71278,"You were in Saarthal, yes? It has come to my attention that something was found there."
71279,"That what he's really doing is spying for the Thalmor, trying to feed them information. Whether it's true, I can't say."
71280,That's right. 
71281,Glory to the Arch-Mage!
71285,My shouting Torygg to the ground proved he had neither.
71291,Members of the College -- your new Arch-Mage!
71292,It shall be done.
71294,"You'll also need to align the mirrors using the controls up above. Once everything is lined up, the light will reflect back through the crystal."
71296,I'll enjoy killing you!
71299,"I haven't figured it out yet, but I will."
71306,"However, it was my sword piercing his heart that killed him."
71310,"By the gods, a dragon! How?"
71314,Thanks for wasting my time. 
71315,"Greetings, sister. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested."
71317,Congratulations!
71322,Still something you'd like me to do?
71323,"You've done it! The College is safe again, thanks to your work."
71324,Long live the Arch-Mage!
71325,A dragon? It's a dragon! Gods help us!
71326,Hooray for the Arch-Mage!
71328,There you are. I've been trying to find you.
71332,Those binds aren't going to cut themselves.
71333,Let's cut you loose.
71334,"Command me, my Listener."
71338,"Thank you for the gold, traveler."
71341,This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim.
71346,"Instead of projecting the sky, we project all of Tamriel, and then harness the latent energies to overlay the positions of..."
71348,This is it men!
71353,My role as advisor to the Arch-Mage is aided by knowing everything that transpires here.
71355,That sounds precisely like the sort of thing that should matter to everyone. Especially me.
71357,This way!
71358,I think the Thalmor are trying to steal my work!
71359,I have made it quite clear that my only role here is as an advisor to the Arch-Mage.
71360,What?
71361,"I can't tell if he expects me to blow myself up, or to try and murder him. But he clearly doesn't trust any of us."
71364,I would suggest that you not further spread this rumor.
71365,"He is rather handsome though, isn't he?"
71366,"It happened so fast. One minute the dragon was there, the next it was gone. Everything was destroyed."
71367,"Most here are up to something, of course, but in his case, it's not good."
71368,Keep firing!
71370,Has everyone here forgotten their training? Kill that thing!
71371,Of course. That's your choice. I just wanted to let you know.
71372,"I'm not sure. Just... Well, mind what you tell him, all right?"
71375,I won't do it. You ask too much.
71376,"But it never hurts to be a little suspicious, does it?"
71377,My wife's going to kill me when I tell her we'll need to bring another cow.
71384,"No, no. Well, I don't think so."
71388,You're welcome.
71390, 
71392,"Yes, General Tullius."
71395,"Hey, what village are you from horse thief?"
71396,"Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!"
71398,Thank you for your help. You may go now.
71399,Is that all?
71401,"Of course, Listener. What is it?"
71405,"But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people."
71406,"Then you've seen them, too. We lost our home, our livestock... We barely have enough gold to get by."
71407,It's true about the dragons returning. Saw it with my own eyes.
71409,That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.
71412,Die villain!
71415,"Sorry, Listener. It can't be done."
71420,Yeah... That's not going to happen.
71422,Divines help us!
71433,"Next, the lizard!"
71436,"Ah, a snitch, eh? Can't have you running to any guards now, can I? "
71437,This should be fun!
71438,"Next, the Orc!"
71439,"Next, the cat!"
71441,(whine)
71444,Dragon!
71458,I'm on my way to a giant camp and I can't guarantee those beasts won't think you're part of the offering.
71468,"Next, the high elf!"
71469,"Some think it's superstition, but I believe it works. I've yet to have a giant kill any of my livestock."
71473,"Next, the wood elf!"
71479,Have you ever seen the Orrery in the Imperial City? It was the inspiration for this idea.
71482,"Thanks. You take care of yourself, now."
71484,Climb in back and we'll be off.
71485,I'm on it.
71486,Right away.
71488,For the Emperor!
71489,Nothing else? I'm always eager.
71491,I know full well that you have. Please do not insult my intelligence.
71494,It is my job to know these things.
71495,"If only I could, Listener."
71498,Let's cut you loose.
71505,"I knew you had it in you. I daresay the Psijics are right. There's no one more deserving to be Arch-Mage, in my opinion."
71506,"Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?"
71512,"I have nothing to say to you. Now move along, or I'll order my guards to attack."
71529,What are you waiting for? Go!
71538,"You continue to amuse and impress. Go forth, with my blessing."
71547,Move!
71553,"Keep away. If I am harmed, people will come looking. "
71554,You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward.
71562,"I see. It probably doesn't even matter now, what with the mess that's been made in here."
71567,"Until next we meet, lad."
71573,"If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do."
71597,This place is sure to make us rich!
71611,Certainly! Glad to see you have the task well at hand.
71622,Justice!
71627,Don't look up. Just focus on me. You can do it!
71645,Beem-Ja!
71665,Kraldar's family was once very powerful in Winterhold. It's my honor to assist him even now.
71674,"They're hurt, but they'll live."
71718,I don't care what Beem says. It's high time we get in there and find our fortune.
71741,"Well met again, Hunter."
71745,"Not a failure, my servant."
71746,And they were no base prey.
71751,"Oh, Beem-Ja. I never meant for this. What have I done?"
71753,Legends don't burn down villages.
71754,"Another second out there with the dragon, and they'd both be dead...."
71755,We'll have to carry this one on our backs....
71756, 
71758,"Haming, get over here!"
71759,Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it.
71760,"Get off the road, boy!"
71761,What are you doing? Get off the road!
71765, 
71769,You Imperial bastards!
71770,Get going!
71776,"Until next we meet, lass."
71779,"You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let her prove it."
71784,Eyes open. Danger could be anywhere.
71786,This place is coming down. Let's get out of here!
71791,I'll add this to the rest of the items. I don't think there's anything further I need from you.
71796,Let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
71814,"By bringing down my other Hunters, you turned the chase inside out."
71854,Death to the Stormcloaks!
71870,"Just walk towards me, come on!"
71872,You should wait until night fall before trying to sneak in. Talos preserve you.
71887,So you may think.
71909,"These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing stones that dot Skyrim's landscape."
71913,"Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? You may have killed the Gourmet, but true artistry never dies."
71932,Damn you mages! Aren't you good for anything?
71934, 
71936,I have a few things laying around that weren't worth adding to the collection. You may look through them.
71937, 
71939,"With me, up the tower!"
71947,"But I think the forge knows the greatness of Kodlak's soul. I can't really explain, but it feels like it's... young."
71948,"Hey now, don't take all the good stuff!"
71950, 
71953,"Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? But not the way you make it! Ha ha ha. No, certainly not..."
71958,"When I woke from cold death, my doom was lifted - there was Shor's Hall, my heart's desire."
71961,"What do you think? Some more Nirnroot, maybe?"
71964,"Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge."
71972,Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow screamed for weeks.
71980, 
72002,Your blood should be good enough. This will go easier for us both if you don't bother fighting back.
72005,Father never trusted Beem. I always thought he was just being overprotective.
72009,"I admit, there is strength in numbers. Perhaps between us..."
72015, 
72032,"This one has something sweet for the fellow traveler, if it entices. "
72036,We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!
72037,I'm eager to try.
72045,"Thief, eh? It's never too late to take charge of your own fate, you know."
72047,"Assorted books, scrolls... I'm sure you'll find something useful."
72049,"Got to admit, I find the Night Mother's presence... comforting."
72055,Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.
72068,It's always been said that the souls of the heroes of old are what give Skyforge steel its strength.
72075,Through here. Let's go!
72081, 
72082,Ralof! You damned traitor. Out of my way!
72087,"You know, since Kodlak's funeral the Skyforge feels more... awake."
72094,It's in the clouds!
72095, 
72101,I'll wager it could now forge metal the likes of which hasn't been seen since eras long forgotten.
72102,See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we can get.
72105,"This way, friend! Move!"
72109,"Please make sure your hands are clean before touching anything, all right?"
72114,Shut up back there!
72117,Halt!
72118,As fearless in death as he was in life.
72121,Each has their own way.
72125,"Oh, Beem..."
72127,"Warrior, good! I knew you shouldn't have been on that cart the minute I laid eyes on you."
72128,"Thief, eh? It's never too late to take charge of your own fate, you know."
72130,"These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing stones that dot Skyrim's landscape."
72131,"Go ahead, see for yourself."
72132,"Warrior, good! Those stars will guide you to honor and glory."
72133,"Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge."
72134,"With me, prisoner. Let's go!"
72135,Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.
72136,"All right, but you just watch yourself. Next time, I might not be so lenient."
72137,"You're not sweet-talking your way out of this. Not after what you did. You're headed to Cidhna Mine, and that's that."
72142,"Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later."
72144,I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the job.
72146,"I learned to cook from my father. Ah, but that was a long time ago. Before, you know... I killed him. But let's not talk about that now."
72148,"Listener, please... if Cicero is going to be a part of this Sanctuary I'll accept that. But can't you do something about the... dancing?"
72150,"We're escaping, Hadvar. You're not stopping us this time."
72152,Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?
72153,I can cut you loose inside. Come on!
72157,"Come on, this way!"
72158,Everyone to the keep!
72161,Thought I told you to run for it! Go!
72162,Dragon!
72164,"I don't care who you're with. After what you did, you're lucky I'm not cutting you down where you stand!"
72166,"Go ahead, see for yourself."
72172,"It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric!"
72175,"What do you need, Listener?"
72176,"The new initiates are working out well. Eager, dedicated, and not afraid to get their hands wet."
72181,"I grow tired of debating this. If Miss Salma insists on this folly, so be it."
72186,"You! Come on, into the keep!"
72191,"But now I wander, weary and lost. Alduin hunts me as we once hunted our prey - a bitter payment for many bloody deeds."
72194, 
72202,"Soldiers, townspeople, and dregs into the keep!"
72207,Beem! What are you doing? Stop it!
72208,"Come on, Beem-Ja. We're going."
72210,Werewolf! Kill the monster!
72213,Let's go!
72217,This is no time for idle talk.
72219,Not now. Stay alert.
72228,"Hadvar! Into the keep, soldier, we're leaving!"
72321, 
72393, 
72459, 
72672, 
72757,Good. Let's get this over with.
72768, 
72770, 
72771, 
72779, 
72783, 
72793, 
72807, 
73020, 
74810,Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them. 
74814,And those winds issue from my whispers.
74815,"I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers."
74822,"I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal."
74835,"You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences."
74855,"The blade will feed on the ire of Tamriel. Bathe in your infamy. Feel the weight of their loathing, and my power will course through it once more."
74858,"To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit. "
74860,"To return to its past glory, it must reacquaint itself with the hatred of this world."
74862,"Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master."
74865,Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me.
74866,Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the song of your grandeur.
74868,"Now go forth, child. Continue your tiny subversions against the orders of trust and intimacy."
74870,"At last, my blade is returned to its full glory."
74871,"Ah, the blood of deceit is a nourishing flow."
74873,Their tears shine the ebony to a sharpest gleam.
74874,I can feel their heartbreak swelling in my blade.
74875,"Excellent work, child."
74876,"You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable."
74877,"The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of children is ultimately too limited for my purposes."
74878,I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore.
