366,I've checked with my court and apparently you're fully eligible... there's nothing standing in the way of presenting you the title.
2091,"I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm sending you to Windhelm."
3970,I can provide you with help for her minions though.  This should help you deal with the Catacombs themselves. 
4136,"Oh don't pretend to be modest. I'm talking about your new role as champion. Apparently, you've taken my people under your wing."
4273,"Well, well. Aren't we the overachiever. Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances..."
4432,"Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right?"
4437,When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?
4579,"Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations."
6004,"I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, this place has gone mad."
7611,I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time if you ask me.
8312,"Well, I'm just surprised the Gourmet is a Redguard. I had you pegged for a Wood Elf, honestly. You know, because of your use of..."
9792,Just get out of here.
11442,You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less...
13649,"If you think you can steal my throne by winning the hearts of the people, that's where you're wrong. Keep that in mind."
14558,She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...
15083,We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
15085,You damn well better.
15545,"Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away."
16074,No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him?
16775,"As to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay."
17426,"Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice."
17791,"But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and did some kind of dark ritual. He summoned killers to murder old Grelod. He's saved us all."
18104,That's it! Wonderful! I knew I could count on you.
19370,"No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden."
20680,We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
21703,Then allow me to officially welcome you to Riften. You'll make a fine addition to our city.
22763,I suppose it's time I gave him an answer...
22765,Ah yes.
22771,"Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that."
22900,Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.
23221,I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for the Winterhold wizards.
23319,"Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. Looks like he really did it!"
23510,"Well, I just never expected the Gourmet to be a Breton. It almost seems too obvious. Some of the greatest cooks have been Bretons, and..."
24028,"The timid warrior and the sly Khajiit. Must have been one or the other, right?"
24313,"Yes. I had Falk call you back because you were at the summoning, you have a connection to Potema now. You must deal with her."
24797,"I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine."
24934,"Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice."
25715,"Hmph. Yes. Yes, I surely can. It's not something I do lightly, mind you, and it's not as specific as you might want. But yes. I will do this for you."
25771,"Good. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to do this. "
27209,"When Aventus escaped, Grelod was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. But that won't happen ever again."
27401,Grelod... murdered. Here. I... I need... air... You... you... Get out of here! Get out!
27927,"Just remember that you're only a part of my court, this doesn't make you one of the family."
27939,Begone from here! Get out of this orphanage! Help!Somebody help me!
27942,Just... leave here! Leave us alone!
28573,"Oh, well, it's just... I never imagined the Gourmet was a Khajiit. You know, because of all the fur, and the potential for getting hair in the..."
28665,All that remains now is to bestow the title upon you.
28750,Ah Potema. Former queen of Solitude and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history.
29826,You... you're an Argonian! Where did you learn to cook like that? Surely not in Black Marsh. Why even the...
30032,"Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it..."
30549,I'll come to your council. But I doubt any good will come of it.
30691,"I used to hate it here, but it's not so bad anymore. Constance is real good to us."
31721,My son is dead! At his own wedding! Only those Imperial dogs would have dared do something like this! Damn them all to Oblivion!
32073,Talking peace with Ulfric? You must be an optimist.
33318,You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.
34388,Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.
34421,Why are you here? Killing Gaius Maro is but the first step of your contract - you must also plant the incriminating letter on his body...
34739,I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.
35488,I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; several of our citizens have expressed their admiration.
36767,You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Keerava.
37643,"I guessed right! I... I always imagined the great Gourmet was a Wood Elf. You see, only someone with a knowledge of woodland herbs could combine..."
37740,"When Aventus escaped, Grelod got meaner than ever. I really thought she was going to kill one of us. Guess not!"
38296,"Token, you say? Let me see."
38593,"A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves."
38594,"For the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs."
38597,I can provide you with some help with her minions. 
38899,"Oh, goodness me. You're a friend of Gabriella's, then. Well, I guess we both know why you're here."
39224,"However, since it wouldn't behoove me to make you disappear, I'd rather have you on my side as Thane of Riften."
40815,"Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away."
40890,Hmm? What's this about?
41082,Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
41399,"So, I've been hearing your name in court quite a bit lately."
41788,"I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, to try and get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. And... he actually pulled it off!"
41799,"Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!"
42057,"Don't worry, I'll come to this peace council of yours."
42770,I guess all that's left is to bestow the title. What were those words again?
44034,"Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities."
45102,"A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died."
45901,You'll never see the sun again. No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one.
46590,You've already taken all the necessary steps in becoming eligible for the title.
46592,Well? Out with it.
47168,"Oh, Asgeir! My husband! My dear, sweet husband! Why would someone do this to you? Why? This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life!"
47717,"Much like Mjoll, you've become champion of our hold; helping people with their difficulties and providing assistance for their needs."
47718,Doesn't matter... the title is yours. I henceforth name you Thane of Riften. Don't disappoint me.
47729,Therefore all that remains is to bestow it upon you.
48684,Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
49110,He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he was trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. Did he really do it?
50629,"Oh, yes. Of course... the whole thane thing. I'd forgotten. If you're ready then, can we get this out of the way?"
51866,"Balimund pulled me out of Grelod's orphanage when I was just a child. I don't know what he saw in me, but I was glad to get out of there."
51918,"It's just... Well... you're an Orc! Ha ha ha! If the people of the Empire only knew! I mean, now I understand your need for secrecy. Most would..."
52069,I should slay you for such insolence!
52070,My good pleasure is not some trophy for mortal sport!
52071,My favor?
52624,You're a High Elf! I... I never would have guessed it. So many of your recipes are clearly aimed at the commonfolk. It just seems...
52627,"I... Well, I just can't believe the Gourmet is a Dark Elf. How difficult it must have been for you in Morrowind. The food there is..."
53850,I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; the people won't stop blathering about you.
54840,"As the Jarl of Riften, I feel it's my duty to honor your selfless behavior by honoring you with the title Thane of Riften."
55267,"When Aventus took off, when he said those things, about killing Grelod... I never imagined he was serious..."
56052,I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war? Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.
56922,"Things are much better now that Grelod is dead, but still. I'm sick of this place."
57086,"The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right?"
57835,"Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return."
58332,"I remember you, you were at Helgen. Speak to Legate Rikke. I suspect we could use someone like you."
58805,"Well, I don't mean to seem disappointed, but... I just never figured the Gourmet was an Imperial. I had dreamed of something more exotic, maybe..."
58901,"Constance don't care much for strangers in the orphanage. Afraid someone might hurt one of us kids. Which, I gotta admit, is kind of nice."
59019,"I've spent years watching his techniques and learning his tricks. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be as talented as he was."
59103,You can return this axe to our friend. The esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.
61675,"By all the gods, the groom has been killed. At his own wedding! I can only think of my own husband..."
61836,I should be the one thanking you. You've solved more problems in the short time you've been here then anyone in my court has their entire careers.
62771,I was apprenticed to Balimund before he died. He taught me everything I know about forging armor and weapons.
63242,The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him.
63322,I can't believe it! Grelod is dead! She's really dead!
63787,Ah yes. I've studied those documents... Very interesting...
64256,"Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you'd visit us again."
